The present patent document is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 951 130 filed Nov. 22 2010 entitled INTEGRATED AUTOMATIC USER SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 of Canadian patent application Ser. No. CA 2691326 which was filed on Jan. 28 2010. The disclosures of Ser. No. 12 951 130 and CA 2691326 are incorporated herein by reference.

This application relates to automated assistance to users of an apparatus or service and in particular to integrated computer implemented automatic user support and assistance systems.

Conventionally if a user of a device apparatus service or system for instance a computer system hardware or software has a problem and the user requires support the user usually has a few options. The user may search for a solution on the Internet largely through search engines. The user may use a general purpose web search engine or an embedded search engine inside each individual web site. These web sites may include a manufacturer s company site or common public forums and blogs. However there are vast amounts of information on the Internet and there is limited time a user can spend to search for the correct solution. Another option is telephoning a customer service representative in a call center. However the customer service representative may also have to go through the vast amount of information stored publicly on the Internet as well as the company s own internal knowledge bases.

Furthermore user support interfaces available on computer systems rely heavily on user input. For example any help query on a conventional support interface requires a user to issue a plurality of information regarding the user s device apparatus service or system typically on a remote computer system or webpage. The information may be compared to a fixed hierarchy of existing frequently asked questions or typical answers and the results of the comparison returned to the user. It follows that if the user does not receive a proper answer or if the answer is incomplete the user must manually enter multiple requests until a proper answer is returned. Further as most systems are either local or remote it is difficult for either instance to establish a reasonable set of solutions.

According to at least one example embodiment a method of integrated automatic support and assistance includes identifying a user wherein identifying the user includes retrieving models representing the device apparatus service summarily called the system operated by the user receiving a query or statement from the user the query or statement being related to a question about or a problem with at least one component on the system determining if the received query or statement is a machine translatable query or statement restructuring machine translatable terms of the received query or statement into semantic components based upon the retrieved models determining a set of candidate knowledge bases both internal and external to the system related to the semantic components submitting the machine translatable query or statement to each knowledge base of the set of candidate knowledge bases receiving a set of responses from each knowledge base of the set of knowledge bases in response to the submitting formatting the set of responses submitting the formatted set of responses to the user determining if a response of the submitted formatted set of responses is accepted by the user applying updated weights within the formatted set of responses and storing the updated weights for future queries.

In order to help users and inexperienced customer service representatives locate solutions relatively easily and quickly an automated virtual guide help system is provided which will interact with users and search for an optimal solution in multiple knowledge bases on user s behalf. The system stores a vast amount of context information such as a user s organizations profile and conducts its activity in the background of such context. This context information may include their installed inventory the user s experience level and their history of interaction with the organization providing assistance among other attributes. By providing a simple and unified interface to its users and intelligently utilizing many of these existing knowledge bases and data sources it shields the user from the details of invoking these tools individually. It also removes the steep learning curve a user faces when finding and accessing these tools individually. The system can be seamlessly extended with new knowledge bases and tools over time.

The system further includes a virtual agent assistant interface portion . The assistant interface portion is disposed to process receive and transmit user statement or queries. The assistant interface portion may process a dialog session such that a user may interact with assistant interface via a computer apparatus . For example the computer apparatus may be in communication with the assistant interface portion . Further the computer apparatus may be any suitable computer apparatus including but not limited to a personal computer laptop computer personal digital assistant PDA cellular telephone smart phone or any other suitable apparatus. The assistant interface portion may utilize most current user interface technology such as 3D animation WEB 2.0 AJAX and ChatBot to actively engage a user.

The system further includes an artificial intelligence AI inference engine in communication with the assistant interface portion . The AI inference or semantic based engine may utilize most current artificial intelligence reasoning technology such as forward and backward chaining rule based reasoning fuzzy rule reasoning bayesian net probability reasoning semantic analysis inferencing and natural language processing. The AI inference or semantic based engine may also monitor the user s activity during a support session and if it determines the subject support issue it may provide help as needed. The AI inference or semantic based engine may aid the user to diagnose problems locate the problem area and fine tune statement or queries prior to investigation. The AI inference or semantic based engine may also help the user resubmit or redefine statements or queries if solutions are not satisfactory. The AI inference or semantic based engine may also help the user navigate a support interface tools asset knowledge base among others if difficulties arise in interpreting a user s statement query. The AI inference or semantic based engine may be disposed to interpret information received from the assistant interface portion . Thus the AI interface engine may interpret selections profiles entitlement levels and other attribute or augmentations provided by users. The AI inference or semantic based engine may further control a user interaction flow based on stored attribute data structures authorization level and user system profiles preferences. For example the AI inference or semantic based engine may be configured to deduce determine aspects of a user s attributes which are known and therefore not request information from a user and to deduce determine aspects of a user s attributes which are not known and therefore request information from a user . The same process may be implemented for profile preference user system organization history and entitlement status. Further based on aspects or knowledge pertaining to user system information the AI inference or semantic based engine may determine particular backend intranet internet sources to access to retrieve information pertaining to a user statement or query. Further the AI inference or semantic based engine may analyze raw data retrieved from multiple backend and or external sources resolve conflicting data from the raw data remove filter noise from the resolved data and rank catalogorize results within the filtered data.

The system further includes rule or semantic based portion in communication with the AI inference portion . The reasoning based portion may include a reasoning repository and a reasoning authoring administration portion .

The reasoning repository is disposed to store a plurality of information pertaining to rules or reasoning e.g. semantics inferencing used by the AI inference or semantic based engine . These include retrieving attributes profile entitlement history structures diagnose problems and addressing user statements or queries. For example the reasoning repository may include attribute analysis inferencing matching associated with users and the user s respective attributes. The reasoning authoring administration portion may be configured to create and manage said rules or semantic strategies. These can be a mixture of different types and formats depending on the technologies used in the AI inference or semantic based engine. For example they may include decision trees taxonomies ontologies forward and backward chaining rules fuzzy rules pattern matching rules constraints bayesian nets or neural nets. It follows that the reasoning authoring administration portion may be disposed to access organize and manipulate the plurality of information stored in the repository .

The system may further include support source portion . The support source portion may include a plurality of support sources services. For example user profile source may store user attribute data such as inventory data structures and user support assistance history. Compatibility advisor may provide tools to analyze compatibility issues problems across a user s componentry. Search application programming interface API may provide a search browse or crawl among other API to search support data or support information on an internal network knowledge bases the Internet World Wide Web or other similar sources. Symptom analyzer may provide access to a symptom database which stores symptom definitions rules relationships structures and recommendations on handling particular symptoms. As well system profile source may store system preferences history weighting parameters data structures.

As discussed briefly above the assistant interface provides user access to the system . is a diagram of a user interface of an integrated automatic assistance system according to an example embodiment. As illustrated the interface may include a plurality of separate display portions disposed to provide an easy to interpret and intuitive display of information. For example the interface may include a selection pane providing a plurality of selectable options. The selectable options include but are not limited to system overview downloads troubleshooting documentation forums i.e. user commentaries planning installation usage service request and question options. A current selection may be displayed on the selection pane .

The interface may further include user interaction interface . The user interaction interface may include a virtual agent assistant portion and dialog interface portion . The virtual agent portion may display a virtual agent through video technology 2D and 3D animation allowing more realistic interaction with the interface . For example the virtual agent may be an animated agent or a pre recorded audio video agent which interacts with a user of the interface through audio sound speech such that a user may both view and or listen to a support dialog. For example the user may view the support dialog at the dialog interface portion . The dialog interface portion may display questions answers selectable options or other suitable data entry utilities to provide a user of the interface the ability to interact and exchange information with the virtual agent. Upon determining a solution or at least a partial solution to a user s query automated support results may be displayed at automated support results portion .

Thus as described above user interface provides a fluid and intuitive support interface which enables a user to effectively exchange information with an automated support system.

Hereinafter methods of integrated automatic support and assistance are described with reference to . The methodologies may be executed as computer instructions on a processor of a computing device i.e. an AI interface engine or other suitable device. 

The method further includes receiving a query or statement from the identified user at block . The received query being associated with the identified user may be intelligently captured. More clearly as a plurality of information including user attributes profile preferences are stored in a system according to example embodiments this information may be used to provide a user with a more tailored interface for which to submit a query or information associated with a previous query. For example a user interface may present the user with a prompt including selectable queries statements based on installed products or based on a user s attributes. Furthermore the received query or statement may be interpreted and parsed such that the user s support profile may be updated to reflect the received query or statement. Therefore redundancy is reduced in contrast to conventional support systems and methods.

The method further may include setting response time expectations for the identified client based on the received query or statement at block . Within the scope of a user s entitlement to information or a user s access profile e.g. severity support tier authorization rights an artificial intelligence AI engine may negotiate response time expectations. For example depending upon the complexity of the received statement or query the AI engine may establish an estimated response time. The estimated response time may be based upon criteria such as severity locality whether or not a similar problem has been previously solved or whether further solutions are necessary. The user may negotiate or rate satisfaction with the response time estimates at block . Thereafter a solution may be determined at block as described in .

The solution to the query or statement may be identified through a diagnostic routine configured to identify the user s problem based upon the received statement or query and thereafter recommend a solution to the user. This approach is described more fully with reference to .

If the received query or statement is understood i.e. machine translatable by the AI or semantic inference engine then one or a few backend knowledge bases tools may be determined for further invocation. The method includes machine validation of the query or statement at block . If the query or statement is not understood the method includes human validation at block . For example a query or statement may be compared to a user s profile information stored within an automatic support system. If the received query or statement does not include products or services within a user s know inventory or history additional information from the user may be necessary. Alternately the system may check the input against the user s profile of previously answered questions to look for discrepancies or inconsistencies. Thus human validation steps including requests for additional information may be established at block . Alternatively if the received query or statement includes products or services associated with a user s inventory or history machine validation of the query or statement may be established at block .

The method further includes restructuring the received query or statement to optimize a search for the statement query s solution at block . For example the received query or statement may be intelligently dissected into semantic components that fit into models that a hosting organization s back end systems already support. That is the question is parsed into semantic components and in a distributed manner dispatched to multiple data sources asset catalogues knowledge bases among others.

The method further includes searching knowledge sources based on the restructured query or statement and redefining the restructured query or statement based upon the searching. A query may be a query based on a received statement internally translated to a query or a received query. For example an integrated automatic support system includes a meta knowledge base that holds the profiles of each of a plurality of separate knowledge bases both internal and external to the system. The profile for example the system profile contains known representations of the content of each knowledge base asset catalogues and instructions on how to query the knowledge bases. Example knowledge bases are described above with reference to .

Thus the user s query is fed into the meta knowledge base and through application of a set of matching algorithms or relationships among the user s query user s profile system profile and knowledge base profile a list of candidate knowledge bases asset catalogues are chosen for the query.

During searching the restructured query or statement is submitted to each individual candidate knowledge base asset catalogue. Results are returned from each knowledge base asset catalogue. Each result is compared with the originally structured query or statement to determine a level of reasonableness of the results. If the reasonableness is below a pre defined or desired threshold further refinement of the query or statement is performed and further searching of the further refined query is performed at each or new candidate knowledge bases asset catalogues. For example the results are evaluated based on a set of matching algorithms or relationships compared to the user s profile. Any result not fitting within the user s profile is downgraded i.e. considered less reasonable . If no suitable results are located the query may be returned to the user with a set of recommendations on how to refine the query for resubmission to the automatic support system.

If suitable results are located at block the results are categorized i.e. classified into related groups at block . For example the data objects may be clustered.

The method further includes returning the grouped results at block . The user may view the return group by either their origins or their categories. For example the categories may be displayed by relevance. For example if a solution creates a higher affinity to the received query or statement that solution should be displayed ahead of other recommendations. Alternately by source all technical publications next all technical community forums and all fixes among other groupings.

According to example embodiments the methodologies described above may be implemented with predictive assistance models including understanding the implications of new additions to the client attribute and what ripple effect they may have on the client s environment. For example a forward chaining knowledge base storing the rules of cause effect relationships among attribute may be implemented in example embodiments. These predictive assistance models are described more fully with reference to .

If the results are satisfactory weighting of the user s profile is updated to reflect the outcome of the automatic support session at block to strengthen weighting of responses for subsequent support sessions.

If the results are not satisfactory the user is queried to determine if they themselves have determined the correct solution the user applied at block . The solution may then be stored for future reference in one of a plurality of knowledge sources as described above.

Turning back to block if the user has not accepted the results of the search the method includes determining any issues the user had with the search at block . For example if the solution delivered does not on its own resolve the problem the client may help the system optimize its approach by changing the weighting on how the system interpreted the question or the result set all of which is reincorporated as feedback to the system. This is described more fully with reference to .

The method further includes determining a type of interaction or interaction style at block if it is determined the issue is attributed to the interaction of the user with an automatic support interface. Thereafter the entry format of the computer human preferred interaction style e.g. more graphical more text more detailed less detailed automatically translated to another language among others is determined at block . Upon determination of the entry format a subsequent entry is interpreted at block . This may include redisplaying the previous result set in a manner specified at block . The human validation of the interpretation is requested at block to validate the new interaction style interface. The user may loop between block and to establish their own most appropriate interaction style. The results of the human validation are stored within the user s preferences in the automatic support system.

Turning back to block the method further includes iteratively refining the received query at block if it is determined the issue is attributed to content returned to the user. For example the automatic support interface may submit additional interpretations to the user until a match is established between the machine interpretation of the query and the user s desired query.

The method further includes displaying parsing information of the interpretation to the user at block . For example a series of parsing steps and search directions based on the parsing may be displayed. The method further includes receiving parsing corrections from the user at block . The method further includes receiving and interpreting weight changes i.e. suggested by the user for algorithms or relationships associated with the corrected parsing at block . The method further includes storing the new weights in the user s profile for use in subsequent automatic support sessions.

Further through review of the abstracts of each result the user may establish a result that may contain a solution to the submitted query. For example the user may easily establish a result which definitely does not contain a desired solution.

For example the user may only select a desired solution. This selected information may be logged in the user s profile which is used to associate the result with the user s query. Selected solutions with higher hits may be rated higher than non selected hits. Subsequently if the same or substantially similar query is presented by another user with a similar profile the higher ranking solutions may be presented first and this type of information is stored in the system profile.

Further the user may also optionally rate the returned answers. The optional ratings may also be used by the automatic support system to associate higher rated results with the user s query and potentially influence system weighting factors.
