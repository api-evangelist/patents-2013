This invention was developed as a collaborative effort between Raytheon and the U.S. Army under the TDO ES 30 follow on contract of Aug. 22 2011.

This disclosure relates generally to air traffic control systems. In particular this disclosure relates more particularly to electronic flight strips used with air traffic control systems and to a method system and apparatus for providing dynamically updated weather and other information to controllers using electronic flight strips.

Air traffic control ATC is a service that promotes the safe orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic. ATC services can assist in promoting safe air travel by providing information which assists in safety preventing collisions with other aircraft obstructions and the ground assisting aircraft in avoiding hazardous weather assuring that aircraft do not operate in an airspace where operations are prohibited and assisting aircraft in distress. ATC services can also assist in the orderly and expeditious flow of aircraft which helps the efficiency of aircraft operations along the routes selected by the operator. Air traffic control services are provided by air traffic control ATC systems. An air traffic control system typically includes a computer and display system that processes data received from air surveillance radar systems for the detection and tracking of aircraft. Personnel such as air traffic controllers use and operate the ATC system. Air traffic control systems are used for both civilian and military applications to determine the identity and locations of aircraft in a particular geographic area.

A controller using an air traffic control system can use a so called flight progress strip FPS for each flight being tracked where the FPS provides a compact and portable way to track a flight keep a record of instructions issued to the flight allow other controllers to observe flight information annotate one or more aspects of the flight information and to pass this information to other controllers who take over control of the flight. Flight progress strips in the past have been made from a printed strip of paper that controllers can hand to each other manually when they pass control to each other. In recent years however some ATC systems have replaced the paper FPS with electronic flight progress strips e FPS also known as electronic flight strips EFS digital flight strips and computerized flight strips . The electronic flight strips are displayed on a computer screen. In some systems the computer screen displaying the touch strips is a touch screen and the controller can perform operations on the strips and pass the strips to other controllers via touch screen operations.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of one or more aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention and is neither intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention nor to delineate the scope thereof. Rather the primary purpose of the summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Electronic flight strips EFS have been implemented to include many of the same elements present in the prior art paper flight strips including but not limited to information such as aircraft type aircraft identification e.g. flight number or other identifier departure location destination location level altitude assigned to the aircraft etc. In addition the EFS can include specific information specific to whether a flight strip is associated with a departing flight e.g. departure gate airborne time route departure runway standard instrument departure SID etc. an arriving flight e.g. arrival runway landing state gate arrival instructions etc. or an en route flight e.g. route destination altitude as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art.

One important advantage that an EFS has over a prior art paper strip is the ability to have at least some of the information displayed on the EFS be automatically updated. This not only improves the performance safety and usability of the EFS it also reduces controller workload and improves controller efficiency and performance by freeing the controller from having to manually annotate the strip with the changed information. The EFS implementations currently available however do not provide a controller with the ability to view or access weather information directly on the flight strip. Controllers must access external systems and data source some of which are integrated and some of which are not with the primary ATC system being used to control traffic. In addition the EFS implementations currently available do not provide the ability to quickly and easily view directly on the flight strip an indicator showing that weather information or other desired information affecting a flight has changed from a predetermined standard. Further the EFS implementations currently available do not provide the ability to view on the flight strip or access via the flight strip weather information that is tailored and dynamically updated for a given flight. In addition the EFS implementations currently available do not have the ability to provide tailored weather related alerts directly on the flight strip or to provide tailored and dynamically updated weather reports with important information highlighted which are accessible via the flight strip.

The following detailed description is provided using the context of providing tailored dynamically updated weather information to an electronic flight strip EFS used in connection with an air traffic control ATC system. As one of skill in the art will appreciate however the systems methods and apparatuses disclosed herein have applicability outside of the disclosed embodiments. For example the systems methods and apparatuses described herein are anticipated to be usable with many different types of systems that would benefit from the ability to provide dynamically updated tailored information i.e. tailored to the entity being monitored or tracked extracted from one or more external systems provided to a user in a compact format and or a quickly viewable format that can be expanded for further tailored details if desired with the ability to enhance the information provided in the compact format with one or more types of attention getting alert notifications. For example it is anticipated that the systems methods and apparatuses described herein could be usable with many different kinds of transportation monitoring and or control systems e.g. for traffic monitoring rail systems in vehicle systems global positioning systems GPS systems for vehicles etc. utility monitoring and or control systems patient monitoring systems and many other systems as one of skill in the art will appreciate. For example at least some embodiments described herein are applicable to virtually any vehicle traveling along a known travel path where the dynamically updatable weather information is useful to provide dynamic alerts via an icon visible either to the vehicle operator or to a controller in operable communication with the vehicle operator of a weather condition that the vehicle may encounter during an as yet untraveled portion of the travel path i.e. when traveling along the travel path . The vehicle operator and or vehicle controller e.g. pilot and or air traffic controller can thus be forewarned about pending or future bad weather along a travel path.

Advantageously at least some embodiments described in this disclosure help to reduce an air traffic controller workload by allowing the controller to access certain weather information easily on the flight strip itself by consolidating flight specific weather information into the readily accessible flight data e.g. the data provided in an Electronic Flight Strip EFS via a weather icon. Weather information is available to the controller from various systems of which. some are and some are not integrated with the primary ATC system being used to control traffic. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the invention described herein by adding a weather icon to the electronic flight strip and by continuously varying the appearance of the icon based on weather status e.g. the weather status for a given location along a flight path that an aircraft is traveling users of the EFS have instantly available dynamically updated tailored weather information constantly available for a given flight without requiring a controller to add to his her workload by having to manually access weather information from the various weather sources. In at least some embodiments the controller can expand the weather information to get further details at any time including but not limited to when the weather icon is highlighted or in any kind of an alert status. The primary sources for weather include but are not limited to the following types of sources 

The weather sources highlighted in Table 1 generally require either the flight crew to tune to a different frequency or if requested from the controller for the controller to access a non integrated system unless it is weather information supplied by the radar primarily precipitation based and then to extract the appropriate information from that and pass it back to the flight crew. From the controller s perspective these actions manually accessing the non integrated system manually extracting the appropriate information take the controller s focus away from the screen or from the flight crew s perspective away from the instrumentation that guides the flight especially so for single pilot Instrument Flight Rules IFR operations .

Incorporating a weather icon on the electronic flight strip EFS as proposed in at least some of the embodiments described herein puts important and relevant information at one location and allows the controller to concentrate his her focus on the flight being controlled via the flight strip . Should a request for current weather be requested by the flight crew or should the controller feel the need to pass on critical weather information to the flight crew the weather icon including an associated pop up tailored information screen with optionally critical or important information highlighted as described herein that is added to the flight strip helps to provide that information for example in a report format quickly easily and with minimal controller distraction. In addition as one of skill in the art will appreciate the type of information presented both on the icon and in the report is configurable. Furthermore the principles associated with adding the weather icon with tailored information associated with it and one or more alert levels applied to it are equally applicable to adding or linking other kinds of non weather tailored information to the electronic flight strip. For example if an EFS contains the route field or icon then tailored dynamically updated information can be linked in a report format to the route and or the route information could be expanded. Many different configurations are possible as one of skill in the art will appreciate.

In at least one embodiment the invention is embodied in an application programming interface API or a user interface. In addition the present invention in one embodiment is embodied in a data structure.

Reference is now made to which is a high level block diagram of a system in which at least some embodiments of the invention can be embodied. The system of includes a set of weather or data sources an optional set of additional data sources an automated parsing and processing computer system APP computer system which in one embodiment includes the computer system of a table of icon settings which can in at least some embodiments be stored in a memory accessible to the APP computer system a flight data processor optional not part of all systems an air traffic control ATC controller system an optional set of additional information recipients a controller who for example is using the ATC controller system and an information bus operably coupling together the elements of the system.

Advantageously in at least one embodiment the system is part of or operably connected to an airport surface management system that includes an air traffic control system and a system having a digital electronic flight strip EFS capability. One example of such an airport surface management system usable with at least some embodiments of the invention is the TOWERTRAC airport surface management system available from RAYTHEON CORPORATION of Waltham Mass. The TOWERTRAC system improves the efficiency capacity and safety of airport operations by networking data that can be shared by controllers pilots ramp operators and other airport users. In addition the TOWERTRAC system includes digital flight strips EFS which can be accessed by touch screen technology allowing them to be shared among controllers. It also is anticipated that at least some of the embodiments described herein are usable with the Federal Aviation Administration FAA NEXTGEN air traffic control system. Another example of an air traffic management ATM system usable with at least some embodiments of the invention is the AUTOTRACK III AT3 system also available from Raytheon. Still another system usable with at least some embodiments of the invention is the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System STARS air traffic control automation system currently being used in many terminal radar approach control TRACON systems around the United States. STARS is intended to replace the Automated Radar Terminal System ARTS . ARTS is still in use at many air traffic control facilities. Further as one of skill in the art will appreciate the system can be part of operably coupled to and or adapted modified from many other types of airport and air traffic systems and or digital flight strip systems including systems available from NAVCANADA of Ottawa Ontario THE DIFLIS Electronic Flight Strip System from Avibit of Graz Austria and the SMARTSTRIPS and TAPTOOLS systems available from FREQUENTIS of Vienna Austria.

Referring again to the set of weather or other data sources comprise any sources of weather information useful for aircraft and or airports including but limited to those listed and further explained in both Table 2 above and in such as Air Traffic Control Terminal Radar Approach Control ATC TRACON ATC En route low level wind shear alert system LLWAS terminal Doppler weather radar TDWR center weather service unit CWSU cloud to ground lightning monitor flight service stations FSS flight watch automatic terminal information service ATIS the tower for a given airport automated surface observation system ASOS and other weather sources such as the Airman s Meteorological Advisory AIRMET the Pilot Report PIREP system and the weather message switching center replacement WMSCR . Any one or more of these weather sources can comprise databases of information that are continually or continuously updated. Note that the system need not be required to access or receive information from all of the exemplary weather sources listed in and can obtain information from other sources not listed here the weather sources are intended as illustrative and not exhaustive. In one embodiment the only weather sources required for the APP Computer system to provide updated weather information in and or be linked to a weather icon on an EFS all of this is described further herein are those sources that are issuing Meteorological Aerodrome Reports METARs and Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts TAFs . These reports are issued periodically e.g. hourly for METARs and the APP computer system can be configured to automatically retrieve or receive them as required.

METARs typically come from airports or permanent weather observation stations. Further as those of skill in the art are aware METARs can be issued at times other than periodically. METAR reports can for example be generated once an hour but if conditions change significantly a report known as a special SPECI may be issued. Some METARs are encoded by automated airport weather stations located at airports military bases and other sites Some locations still use augmented observations which are recorded by digital sensors encoded via software and then reviewed by certified weather observers or forecasters prior to being transmitted. Observations may also be taken by trained observers or forecasters who manually observe and encode their observations prior to transmission.

In the United States the weather forecasters responsible for the TAFs in their respective areas are located within one of the 122 Weather Forecast Offices operated by the United States National Weather Service. In contrast a TTF Trend Type Forecast which is similar to a TAF is always produced by a person on site where the TTF applies. In the United Kingdom for example most TAFs at military airfields are produced locally however TAFs for civil airfields are produced at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter. The United States Air Force employs active duty enlisted personnel as TAF writers. Air Force weather personnel are responsible for providing weather support for all Air Force and Army operations.

As noted above the APP computer system can be implemented using a computer system having elements similar to those listed for the computer system as one of skill in the art will appreciate. In at least one embodiment the APP computer system is configured and operably programed to retrieve and or receive from the weather sources or other weather databases weather information that is tailored for a given flight i.e. a particular aircraft traveling a particular route . The APP computer system in at least some embodiments also is configured to retrieve receive weather information for multiple different flights wherein the APP computer system then parses the weather information to tailor it and advantageously to create a tailored weather report for each flight so that information relating to the retrieved weather information can be presented in the weather icon and or in the pop up weather report each of which is described further herein . As also illustrates the APP computer system also is configured to retrieve receive other kinds of information e.g. from the additional information providers and or other sources and databases of information especially information that is usable to help determine which weather information is appropriate or necessary for a given flight. For example by retrieving flight plan information the APP computer system can analyze that information to 

determine the geographic path of a given flight e.g. start location en route locations path and arrival location 

based on the geographical locations retrieve and continually update appropriate weather information for that flight 

automatically analyze the retrieved information to determine if weather information has changed and or has met a predetermined condition worthy of notifying a controller and or pilot 

present an icon or other indicator on a flight strip that by itself can convey whether or not weather information for that given flight has changed or has met a predetermined condition 

provide if requested by a user e.g. a controller or pilot a weather report comprising an expanded dynamically updated tailored view of weather information for that flight which report optionally can be converted from a first standard report format readable and usable by a first type of user to a second format readable and usable by a different type of user and

highlight on the weather report changed information and or information that has met a predetermined condition.

Advantageously in at least some embodiments the APP computer system stores e.g. in its memory in persistent storage in removable storage and or in computer readable media a table defining for a predetermined plurality of different weather conditions a corresponding predetermined plurality of sets of visually distinguishable icon settings wherein each weather condition corresponds to a corresponding respective set of icon settings. For example a certain type of good weather condition can be associated with a respective set of icon settings that assign a first color e.g. green to the icon. A different weather condition such as a weather condition of mild concern to a pilot can be associated with a respective set of icon settings that assign a second color e.g. yellow to the icon. Still another weather condition such as a severe weather condition of critical importance to a pilot can be associated with a respective set of icon settings that assign a third color e.g. red to the icon and also assign another feature e.g. highlighting flashing on and off flashing between two different colors to the way the weather icon is displayed. Of course these examples are illustrative and not limiting. A controller viewing the appearance of the weather icon on the EFS would be able to prioritize when if he or she needs to click on the weather icon to obtain further weather information e.g. the weather report as discussed below that can be provided to a pilot. Advantageously the appearance of the weather icon by itself is sufficient to convey at least some information about at least one weather condition to a trained viewer of the weather icon e.g. a controller . Further in some embodiments if the weather corresponds to certain predetermined conditions especially severe conditions the appearance of the weather icon will remain the same e.g. in a red flashing condition in some instances until the controller retrieves the additional weather information where the retrieval of the additional weather information can in some instances clear at least some of the settings applied to the weather icon .

The dynamic retrieval of updated weather information and optionally in some embodiments updated flight path information can be done in some embodiments automatically e.g. periodically . Note that in one embodiment the EFS optionally includes information capable of conveying the progress of the flight such as latitude longitude information or a bearing and distance from the next fix along the flight s route or path. Advantageously the APP computer system is continuously or periodically retrieving tailored weather information for a given flight. In at least some embodiments the APP computer system retrieves and or updates weather information from weather sources based on a received request from a controller . In at least some embodiments the APP computer system retrieves updated weather information automatically from one or more of the weather sources based at least in part on non weather information that the computer system detects retrieves or receives including but not limited to information such as 

In a further embodiment the APP computer system is configured to retrieve weather information and tailor it for a purpose other than for use on a flight strip of just one flight the same information may be usable for example in a first weather icon on a first flight strip and a second weather icon on a second flight strip where the first flight strip is associated with a first flight and the second flight strip is associated with a second flight. For example the APP computer system can retrieve weather information and further use it for a given flight path or geographical region location or portion of a flight path or region that is applicable to and or usable by multiple aircraft that may use or cross that path and multiple weather icons that each appear on respective flight strips such that a controller responsible for any aircraft passing through that portion of the flight path or who is responsible for all aircraft passing through the geographical region location can be alerted via the flight strip s that controller is working to weather changes weather alerts. With this configuration a controller or other user of the system effectively has access to a tailored weather report for that portion of the flight path or geographical region location and such a tailored weather report could be applicable to multiple flight strips that a controller may be working or even flight strips used by multiple controllers because a given flight strip may be passed from controller to controller . The controller can then use this information in the report to keep the pilot of the corresponding flight i.e. the flight associated with the flight strip informed regularly about weather conditions affecting the flight both in the present and in the future.

In a further embodiment every flight for which a defined route is known and for which a flight strip is generated will have an associated weather icon . The intelligence of the system e.g. the APP computer system analyzes the route and extracts from the available weather products weather that is applicable to the route. The alerting of bad weather is shown for all flights that are routed through the area or waypoint and which have a flight strip .

Additional elements of the system can provide inputs to the APP computer system where the inputs at least provide the APP computer system with access to information that the APP computer system uses to help retrieve the appropriate weather information and possibly additional other information for a given flight flight path region etc. It also should be understood that although the block diagram of may represent certain entities e.g. the information providers as separate blocks in the figure these blocks and or their functionality can be combined with other blocks in the figure or may in fact be part of another block in the figure. For example the FDIO system which has access to flight plans is in at least some embodiments actually part of the ATC system . Those of skill in the art will appreciate other entities that may be combined within based on application.

In one embodiment the APP computer system can receive information about the flight data plan for a given flight typically from a flight data input output FDIO system which can be part of the ATC as noted above as those of skill in the art will appreciate. In a further embodiment the flight data processor takes the route in the flight plan and expands it out such that every fix point is known. The Latitude Longitude of these fixes are known as well as the departure and destination. Thus the trajectory or flight path is known as is the departure and destination. Once all this data is available the APP computer system collates applicable information and searches through the available weather products e.g. the weather data sources to match the weather along the departure destination and the flight path. The APP computer system also can receive information from the radar control facility e.g. the terminal radar approach control TRACON in the US or terminal control in non US locations . If applicable the APP computer system may also receive retrieve one or more NOTAMs notices to airman or other notifications indicative of potential hazards along a flight route or at a particular location. The FAA maintains a NOTAM database that users can subscribe to accordingly in one embodiment the APP computer system is a subscriber to NOTAMs. Another input can be other ATC radar information as applicable. .

In at least some embodiments the APP computer system also may accept manual inputs from users such as direct input or requests from pilots input from air traffic control personnel and inputs from other authorized users. For example in one embodiment the pop up weather report described further herein is configured to include a scratch pad area see where additional notes such as pilot reports PIREPs can be added pertaining to weather. The scratch pad is in one embodiment preformatted such that when entered the information on the scratch pad can be added to the database of pilot reports. Having the information on the scratch pad added to the pilot report PIREP database means that other flights are then able to pick that PIREP up if they route through the same area where the PIREP was originally added . Note that the aircraft in some instances has its own weather gathering systems. The addition of the weather icon to the EFS as described herein helps provide a service that allows the weather to be translated to the pilot on request if the aircraft does not have such capabilities or if the pilot wants additional information.

The Airline and airport operations also can provide inputs to the APP computer system as well as information from an air route traffic control center ARTCC in the US or the Area Control Center ACC outside the US . The APP computer system would then use some or all of these inputs to help determine which radar information is applicable for a given flight.

Various other entities use the information bus to exchange and receive information including other airport or ATC facilities Tower information computers ATC displays archive and data storage systems and air traffic controllers as well as their ATC controller systems . Generally in the information sources are illustrated above the information bus and the information recipients are shown below the information bus although the APP computer system acts as both an information source and an information recipient in at least some embodiments . Further as one of skill in the art will appreciate some information changes as a flight s status changes e.g. for an aircraft on the ground versus an aircraft that has departed where a tower strip then becomes a departure strip .

The ATC controller system which may include one or more elements of the computer system of includes a flight strip display and one or more user input devices such as keyboards mice digital or touchscreen pens trackballs and the like. The flight strip display displays a plurality of electronic flight strips arranged in a manner as is known in the art. The controller interacts with the electronic flight strips in a manner known in the art except that the controller is able to use and respond to the weather icon see that has been added to the flight strips e.g. via icon or other indication as shown in exemplary embodiments of A E and discussed below as further described herein. Note that as explained further below in at least some embodiments it is expected that the ATC controller system include at least one user input device capable of enabling a controller to further expand the weather icon or other weather indicator to bring up a tailored weather report viewable by the controller . For example as discussed below in connection with instead of conveying changes in information via a weather icon a different icon or data section on the electronic flight strip could have its appearance changed e.g. color or brightness to further designate information relating to weather in addition to whatever else the other icon if present or data already indicates . The further expansion of the weather information can in one embodiment brings up a window or other visual indication showing additional weather information see e.g. the example embodiments in which are described further below .

As those of skill in the art will appreciate however if the appearance of something other than a designated weather icon is used to convey changes in weather information on a flight strip the item being changed e.g. another data item or icon on the strip or portion of the strip must be carefully selected to avoid confusing the controller especially since multiple items changing colors on a strip can overload a controller . Furthermore deciding which information on the strip or area of the strip to have its appearance varied other than via addition of a weather icon also must take into account whether the weather changes can be adequately and accurately conveyed using that other information or area of the strip. For example a given route for an aircraft may include fix points that are separated by a large distance. If the fix points were chosen to vary in appearance to reflect weather and if there is a weather cell area of weather in between these fixes it may be difficult to adequately convey using the fixes only the location of the weather cell highlighting just one of the route points might not accurately convey the location of the cell.

Advantageously in at least some embodiments e.g. as shown in a weather icon is placed on the electronic flight strip . The weather icon can take any form shape or color the exemplary rectangular shape is provided for illustration and not limitation. In at least some embodiments the weather icon is placed on the EFS in a non obscuring part of the strip i.e. so as not to obscure other information on the strip and the weather icon is always present on the EFS but this is not the only way to convey weather information in the EFS . For example depending on the size of the EFS the size of the weather icon and the size of the display it may he possible that the weather icon be implemented such that its location varies from strip to strip e.g. the strip can be enlarged to accommodate the weather icon . It is preferable if possible that the weather icon not block or overlay other information on the strip . The weather icon also could be implemented to be an outline shape that can outline a piece of information on the strip or even outline the entire EFS with a border without obstructing any information on the EFS .it. In accordance with at least some of the embodiments described herein so long as the usability of the EFS for its purpose is not compromised the weather icon may be sized and placed anywhere on the EFS strip and can take on any size shape color appearance etc. It may be advantageous for usability in at least some embodiments of the invention to ensure that the weather icon be in approximately a consistent general location in each strip. For example in the departure EFS of the weather icon is located in approximately the same relative location as is the weather icon on the arrival EFS of .

As will be explained further herein in at least some embodiments the weather icon has a first predetermined color and this first predetermined color changes to a different visually distinguishable color or changes in some other visually distinguishable way without changing the color such as highlighting flashing such as alternating between a lighter color and a darker color whether the colors are different shades of the same color different colors different hues etc. changing size etc. should the weather information for the given flight change or reach a predetermined condition for example the change in weather is significant enough to meet certain predetermined criteria . Because controllers generally look for consistency in the EFS information the change in appearance should be one that is readily perceivable but does not completely change the appearance of the EFS make the weather icon unrecognizable or make the entire EFS confusing to read as one of skill in the art will readily appreciate. For example if the change in appearance of the weather icon is to move it from one part of the EFS to another part or to change its shape or orientation in some manner so as to make it more prominent such a change must be done in a way that still maintains a consistent general appearance for the controller . Some manufacturers of systems and other EFS users may prefer the weather icon as described in at least some embodiments herein because it compactly consistently and conveniently conveys weather information and weather changes without requiring significant other changes to the EFS .

As noted above in at least some embodiments the APP computer system has access to a table storing various sets of settings defining the appearance of weather icon based on weather condition. This change in the appearance of the weather icon will convey to a controller or other user of the ATC display quickly and effectively updated weather information including the ability to get further info by selecting the icon to pop up into a window with further information as desired needed without requiring the controller to manually query other systems for the information or to otherwise have to have his or her attention directed away from the ATC display . The ability to select the icon to pop up into a window can be done whether or not the icon has been visually changed or whether or not weather has changed.

In contrast at least some known prior art systems often require a controller seeking weather information to manually go to other systems for this information such as by manually requesting and retrieving METARS and TAFs then manually reviewing and parsing analyzing decoding and or interpreting them as needed e.g. to provide information to pilots . Part of this manual process of retrieving information from external systems can require a controller to provide information manually to his or her computer system such as inputting the geographic locations of interest e.g. where flight is starting from where is where it is finishing what it its path etc. For example the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA provides aviation weather information e.g. TAFs and METARs and a user must manually enter information such as airport code to get the appropriate aerodrome based weather. A user also can obtain other information such as AIRMETs and area forecasts. After the search information is entered the controller s computer would query the remote weather system to retrieve information e.g. TAFs and METARS which the controller must then parse manually to determine the actual weather at the locations of interest. This process is not only slow and distracting but has much potential for operator error especially for a controller who is already busy with having to handle multiple flights and flight strips . Further this requires continual manual data request and retrieval by controller to keep the information up to date.

Based at least in part on some of the exiting information in the fight strip such as the flight number or path or information otherwise capable of identifying a flight or flight path or capable of identifying locations such as information retrieved received from the sources through in weather information is retrieved block from weather data sources block for the flight along its flight path. For example if the FDIO system which in one embodiment is part of ATC system provides a report that includes a flight number and flight path the APP computer system parses this report to determine e.g. via a lookup table or other techniques known in the art the corresponding geographical locations for the flight. The APP computer system then automatically provides these geographic locations to the weather data sources to retrieve appropriate weather reports relevant to these locations.

The weather data sources being queried by the APP computer system can include one or more weather data sources of but need not include all of them. In at least some embodiments the weather information is retrieved or received at a regular e.g. periodic schedule from at least some of the weather data sources . For example in one embodiment because a METAR is typically issued once per hour for a given flight path or location the retrieving of the METAR in block is configured to retrieve the METAR once per hour such as when the METAR has been updated. METAR Reports are generated once an hour but if conditions change significantly a report known as a special SPECI may be issued. For example a SPECI may be issued for a fast moving weather system. Thus the APP computer system could for example retrieve or receive a METAR report at the top of the hour and one or more SPECI reports as the weather changes based on one or more predetermined criteria at perhaps more frequent intervals e.g. less than an hour then another METAR at the top of the next hour.

In a further embodiment retrieval of weather data can be based on some other factor other than periodic retrieval as one of skill in the art would appreciate. For example if a flight path changes from a filed flight plan to a different flight path where information indicating the change is based on receiving retrieving updated information block from the sources block then the receipt of or retrieval of the updated information in one embodiment triggers automatic retrieval block of updated weather information block from the weather sources. It also would in some instances result in the generation of a new EFS . Weather information also could be retrieved via a manual request.

In a still further example of a route change that impacts weather and which also could result in generation of a new EFS a controller or a pilot e.g. manual sources can inform the APP computer system that some event or condition has occurred and the APP computer system determines based on the weather information that it has already retrieved received whether the nature of the event or condition means that additional new weather information must be retrieved. For example such a request could be made when an aircraft has an equipment malfunction or on board medical or other passenger emergency. Any of these conditions may require that the aircraft make an emergency landing in a location different than the planned arrival location. This information block whether automatically or manually e.g. via a pilot and or controller request is conveyed to the APP computer system block so that if necessary updated weather information for the new landing location can be retrieved block and conveyed using the weather icon on the flight strip which as noted above is likely to be a new flight strip because the route has changed .

Referring again to after the appropriate weather information is retrieved a tailored weather report is prepared block . In one embodiment the tailored weather report includes but is not limited to information such as one or more of 

The data in the tailored weather report is kept up to date block for the duration of the flight and can be updated automatically or as manually requested. For example one way of keeping data in the tailored weather report up to date manually is via a Computer System Parameter CSP which is adaptation based and needs to be updated to adaptation or via a Variable System Parameter VSP which could be done online. Both of these parameter changes do involve some manual configuration change. None of these are automatic some manual configuration change is involved. Specifically the ATC system would have the ability to configure what weather is shown in the pop up weather report via either a CSP or a VSP. In one embodiment use of a CSP is preferable as that would mean a controlled change via an adaptation download rather than a VSP which is dynamically changed in an online system. One of skill in the art will appreciate that dynamically changing an online system e.g. via a VSP must be carefully implemented such dynamic changes could be problematic if a user has access to the Monitor and Control part of the ATC system and changes system parameters incorrectly and or without an understanding of the ramifications of the changes being made.

In a further embodiment the weather data presented in the weather report is automatically limited to only that information is pertinent for the specific aircraft s route of flight. For example for TAFs only the section of the TAF that affects the approximate estimated time of arrival ETA of the flight is shown in the weather report . In a further example PIREPS for departure are only shown until the aircraft is airborne as the aircraft approaches the destination airport only PIREPS within the one hour of ETA get included. In a still further example for an AIRMET only those appropriate for the route of flight get included in the weather report . In a still further example for METARs both departure and destination are initially included in the weather report but the departure METARs are excluded from the weather report once the aircraft is airborne. The weather data in the weather report is continuously updated blocks see feedback loop in and continuously tailored for the flight as the flight proceeds along its route. Thus if a flight crew requests data the controller only passes current weather data tailored for the route of flight. In one embodiment the controller passes the weather data to the aircraft orally.

Referring briefly to the exemplary weather report in an experienced air traffic controller is able to interpret the listed TAF information to understand that one of the lines on the TAP is highlighted to show that from 27th at 1600Z to 27th 1800Z the visibility is 1500 meters i.e. less than a statute mile in smoke. Alternately in one embodiment at least a portion of the information in the weather report e.g. the TAF can be converted or decoded from a standard format such as METAR or TAF format to English or another language and presented in the tailored report in that format instead of in the actual report format block . For example consider the information contained in a pilot report PIREP . It is useful in at least some embodiments to provide PIREPs as part of the weather report and based on the needs of users the weather report can be tailored to include only information less than an hour old although this is not required . The following is an example of a PIREP in its standard form 

At the end of this disclosure further examples of reports usable as part of the weather report along with example decoded listings of them are provided. Note also that the optional conversion decoding of the weather report from standard formats e.g. standard TAF format etc. to a plain language format understandable to more users can happen at virtually any time during the process of . For example it can be done as the report is prepared block or can be done just before displaying it block or at any other time prior to displaying to the user. It is further envisioned that if the weather report is displayed in coded format block that user can request via predetermined user inputs e.g. pressing a certain keyboard key combination or selecting an on screen icon an on the fly conversion of the weather report to a plain language format. In a further embodiment the system can be configured such that the tailored weather report always decodes the coded inputs by default.

Referring again to and the pop up weather report is configured to be linked to the weather icon in manner known in the art such that if a user clicks on the weather icon or selects the weather icon in any way block the icon expands into a window block that contains the tailored weather report see e.g. . This is discussed further herein. The weather icon is displayed as part of the EFS strip that is displayed in accordance with one embodiment of the invention blocks and .

As noted above the weather icon advantageously is placed in a consistent location on each EFS . For example is an illustrative example of a full departure electronic flight strip EFS including a weather icon usable with the system of and the methods of in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The illustrated exemplary electronic flight strip of is for a full departure from Mumbai from gate I12. is an illustrative example of a departure truncated EFS also from Mumbai including a weather icon usable with the system of and the methods of in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. is an illustrative example of an arrival EFS including a weather icon usable with the system of and the methods of in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. is an illustrative example of an arrival truncated EFS including a weather icon usable with the system of and the methods of in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. is an illustrative example of an en route EFS including a weather icon usable with the system of and the methods of in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. As each of these exemplary flight strips shows the weather icon is generally located in about the same location on each respective EFS but this is not of course required.

In block the EFS with dynamically updated weather icon is provided to the ATC Controller System to be displayed block on the flight strip display . In one embodiment at the time the EFS is generated the weather icon is included with it block . In another embodiment the weather icon is displayed even if no weather data is yet associated with it in that instance if there is no data for weather or no data yet the pop up weather report will have no weather data shown. For example in one embodiment a blank pop up weather report would have just headings with no data. Once the system has data available provided by weather products that are connected to the ATC system and APP computer system the data will be updated the pop up will become populated and if applicable the icon will flash or change in some other manner to indicate the presence of weather data . It should be understood that the actions in block are not required to happen after the actions of block these two blocks can occur in any order.

In one embodiment if one or more predetermined weather conditions or even other kinds of conditions if applicable change blocks e.g. in the METAR or TAF for the arrival aerodrome of the flight e.g. in one embodiment based upon the criteria given in the definition column of Table 3 below then the weather icon linked to the tailored weather report the icon will change its appearance e.g. via highlighting flashing change of color etc. as shown in blocks so that the weather icon will draw the attention of the controller . The weather icon will maintain its changed appearance until the weather window is opened or clicked block by the controller or another user.

The predetermined condition that that can trigger the change in appearance of the weather icon is not limited solely to a change in weather information for the arrival aerodrome of a flight as noted previously. Weather information changes on other portions of the flight path including en route also can trigger a change in the appearance of the weather icon as discussed herein. Further although shows three different conditions resulting in three different types of changes to the appearance of the weather icon the invention is not so limited. A single change in condition could depending on user system requirements and on the nature of the change itself result in more than one change to the weather icon e.g. both change in color and highlighting for example . There also could be multiple different conditions resulting in multiple different colors and or alterations to the weather icon as one of skill in the art will appreciate.

In one embodiment the weather icon in one embodiment would be highlighted block when the weather is received and conditions have deteriorated within specific limits see Table 3 below . In one embodiment when or after a user accesses the weather report block via the weather icon the appearance of the weather icon would change back to its regular i.e. un highlighted or un changed appearance until the next time an update is received and the update has a change that changes the weather to a predetermined condition e.g. one of the conditions in Table 3 based upon a definition also given in Table 3 . Of course if during the time a controller is viewing the weather report block the weather data is updates such that an additional condition is detected that would result in a change to the weather icon then the clearing of block effectively would not be conveyed to the controller because as soon as the weather report screen is closed block the updated information would be processed blocks and would result in a new alteration in the appearance of the weather icon .

Referring to block and herein in one embodiment if the change in weather condition causes the appearance of the weather icon to change e.g. to become highlighted change color flash etc. when the corresponding weather page e.g. as shown in described further herein is opened the textual part s of the weather report on the weather page that caused the change of condition would be highlighted or otherwise noted for easy recognition by a user . If more than one condition is related to the change in weather then in one embodiment the corresponding color or other indicator associated with the weather icon will correspond to the more serious of the two weather conditions. That more serious weather condition is highlighted in the pop up weather report along with the less serious weather condition.

As one of skill the art will appreciate there are many different kinds of conditions and threshold levels and ranges of acceptable levels especially for weather that warrant changing the appearance of the weather icon so as to alert the controller . For example one family of conditions that can trigger a change in appearance of the weather icon is the set of conditions that includes ceiling e.g. the height above the earth s surface of the lowest layer reported as broken or overcast or as the vertical visibility into an indefinite ceiling and or visibility the greatest horizontal distance over which objects or bright lights can be seen and identified over at least half of the horizon circle. Prevailing visibility is taken as the representative visibility at a particular location. There also is vertical visibility which is the vertical distance that an observer or some remote sensing device can see into a cloud . The following table usable with at least some exemplary embodiments of the inventions lists definitions of Visual Flight Rules VFR Marginal VFR Instrument Flight Rules IFR and Low IFR and corresponding colors of weather icon note that in Table 3 ceilings are Above Ground Level AGL and visibility is given in Statute Miles SM imperial measurements in the US airspace 

In one embodiment only the METAR and TAFs for a given flight need be parsed analyzed to detect a condition change as defined in Table 3 e.g. a weather change significant enough to require alerting the controller or other user of the EFS . In a further embodiment the only METAR and TAFs that require parsing analysis are those for the time period encompassing the estimated arrival time of the flight but this is not limiting. Note also that depending on the location i.e. country state in which the system is being used the visibility in the METAR TAF reports as well as other data from weather data sources might be in either in imperial or in metric measurement. If a country state provides visibility in metric then the visibility needs to be converted to imperial units and then the condition applied to it. India for example publishes their visibility in meters the US publishes it in statute miles. The UK publishes it in meters also. Additionally the figures in Table 3 are likely to change for each state country implementing the embodiments of the invention note that Table 3 is applicable to the US .

Referring again to as noted above if the controller or other user clicks on the weather icon block a window is expanded popped up or otherwise displayed to the controller such as on the flight strip display containing the weather report block . In at least some embodiments it is not required that the weather report be displayed or overlaid onto the flight strip display . For example if the ATC controller system is configured to include a secondary display or if the controller has access to another display it may be advantageous to instead display the weather report on a different display block that is available to the controller . This can be advantageous for example if it is desired that none of the flight strips be obscured by the weather report . After the weather report is displayed block the icon can be reset block then the updating continues as new weather reports come in and or as new updated weather reports are requested e.g. by the controller and or aircraft blocks are continuously repeated until the flight has landed .

In one embodiment the weather icon is completely reset to an unaltered appearance once a controller has acknowledged it e.g. by clicking and bringing up the weather report . In another embodiment some of the conditions that alter the appearance of the weather icon are reset but not all. For example in one embodiment the highlighting or flashing if applicable of the weather icon is reset once acknowledged block but the changed color of the weather icon would remain as reflected by the condition that set the changed color until the next update of weather information. Then if applicable the color of the weather icon would change accordingly to reflect changes in weather information blocks . In one embodiment highlighting that appears in the text of the pop up weather report only stays highlighted during the first time the pop up weather report is opened blocks then once the pop up weather report has been opened displayed effectively acknowledging the highlighted or flashing weather icon block the highlighting in the text of the pop up weather report also would be reset block . Thus if the pop up weather report had already been opened when the change of weather condition first occurred the text would have been highlighted but if the pop up weather report was once again accessed without an update having occurred blocks execute but no change in weather information and or no updates available then the text in the pop up weather report that was previously highlighted would no longer be highlighted.

The above exemplary embodiments have been discussed in connection with adding a weather icon to an EFS and changing the appearance of that weather icon to reflect weather conditions and or changes in the weather conditions. However at least some of these principles can he conveyed in at least some other embodiments without the need to add a new weather icon to the EFS . For example in one embodiment an existing icon or data listing on the EFS can be enhanced in a manner similar to the way the weather icon is enhanced e.g. having its color change having it flash etc. wherein even if the icon or data listing by itself has nothing to do with weather it also can be used effectively to convey weather information via its color flashing or highlighting. Consider for example the exemplary EFS of . One of the existing icons or data fields on the EFS for example the takeoff state or flight state could he appropriately colored highlighted etc. to reflect the status of the weather and or changes in weather.

In a still further embodiment although the APP computer system continually retrieves receives updated weather information as described above the information is not conveyed to the controller via a weather icon on the EFS or by enhancing an existing icon as described above in connection with . Instead other types of alerts can be provided to the controller e.g. on screen to permit the controller to view or access the tailored dynamically updated weather report . For example is a third flow chart showing a third method in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. is an illustration showing flight strip display with a pop up weather reported linked to an on screen controller alert usable with the method of in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.

The method of is similar to that of except that instead of alerting the controller via new icon i.e. a weather icon or via enhancing of one or more existing icons or data points on the EFS the APP Computer system provides an onscreen alert that is linked to the tailored dynamically updated weather report block . As with the method of the method of includes continually retrieving receiving updated weather information block preparing associated tailored dynamically updated weather reports block and linking these reports to a way of alerting the controller block .

For example if weather changes in accordance with a first predetermined condition block a first alert is provided to the controller block such as via a message appearing somewhere on the EFS display other than on an EFS itself where the message advantageously provides an indication as to the associated flight to which it is applicable. The controller can then select the alert or otherwise respond to it block to bring up the tailored dynamically updated weather report block . Further if the flight strip display is too crowded to display the tailored weather report in at least one embodiment the controller can have the option of getting the weather report some other way such as printing it if printer is conveniently nearby this may be helpful if weather report is long and controller wants to be able to read through it all to properly convey information to an aircraft or sending to another adjacent controller display such as another display adjacent to the flight strip display . block . The alert itself although shown in as an onscreen alert is not limited and can be conveyed in any applicable automated manner e.g. via a display screen an alert appearing at the top or bottom of the flight strip display a sound message or other auditory alert etc. wherein the controller can respond to the alert e.g. via an input on screen click voice request etc. and be provided with the tailored dynamically updated weather report.

Although the tailored dynamically updated weather reports discussed herein have been primarily shown using TAFs and METAR other types of weather information can of course be included. For example another type of report that can be provided in the weather report as is or in decoded form is an AIRMET. An AIRMET is issued to amend the area forecast concerning certain weather phenomena which could potentially hazardous to aircraft that have limited equipment instruments or pilot qualifications. For example an AIRMET is generally issued to warn General Aviation aircraft of weather such as icing moderate turbulence etc. As those of skill in the art are aware there are three types of AIRMETS each identified by its own phonetic letter 

AIRMET SIERRA This type of AIRMET is issued during periods of mountain obscuration or IFR instrument flight rules . For this type of AIRMET to be issued the ceilings must be less than 1 000 feet or the visibility less than 3SM and this must be affecting 50 of the area for which it is forecasted.

AIRMET TANGO This type of AIRMET is issued during periods of moderate turbulence. Moderate turbulence is defined as changes in altitude and or attitude occur but the aircraft remains in positive control at all times. It usually causes variations in indicated airspeed. Occupants feel definite strains against seat belts or shoulder straps. Unsecured objects are dislodged. Food service and walking are difficult. An AIRMET TANGO also can be issued when the surface winds are sustained at speeds greater than 30 knots.

 This AIRMET Sierra is update number four for IFR and mountain obscuration valid until 2100Z on the 8th day of the month. The AIRMET is for IFR off of California Calif. and coastal waters. It extends from 20 WNW RZS to 50 SW HEC to 40 ESE MZB to 190 SW MZB to 70 SW RZS to 20 WNW RZS which if you were to draw on a map would create a box. Ceilings below 1 000 and visibility below 3SM. This is due to mist and fog. These conditions are expected to continue beyond 2100Z. 

In at least some embodiments it may be useful to associate certain colors with each type of AIRMET i.e. Sierra Tango and Zulu. For example in one embodiment if one of the weather conditions is for Visual Flight Miles VFR and either MVFR does not meet requirements for minimum requirements for visual meteorological conditions or AIRMET Sierra was issued the weather icon is configured to flash yellow with the appropriate piece of text in the weather report being highlighted i.e. the weather that sent the status to MVFR and or AIRMET Sierra . In a further example in one embodiment for a weather condition that includes AIRMET Tango the color of the weather icon would turn pink and if the weather condition includes AIRMET Zulu the color of the weather icon would turn red. One of skill in the art would recognize that it can be advantageous to select colors for the weather icon that by themselves can help convey important information to a controller for example a weather icon that is colored green could be set to indicate that conditions are good or unchanged and various shades of red e.g. light pink dark pink could convey worsening conditions up to true red to convey the most serious conditions. These examples are of course merely illustrative and not limiting.

Still another type of weather information that can be included in the tailored dynamically updated weather report is a SIGMET. A SIGMET as is known in the art is a weather advisory issued concerning weather significant to the safety of all aircraft. SIGMET advisories cover severe and extreme turbulence severe icing and widespread dust or sandstorms that reduce visibility to less than 3 miles. SIGMETS generally are considered more severe than AIRMETS. There are two types of SIGMETs convective and non convective 

Convective SIGMET In order for a Convective SIGMET to be issued there must be an area of thunderstorms affecting a 3 000 square mile area or greater a line of thunderstorms at least 60 NM long and or severe embedded thunderstorms that are expected to last a minimum of 30 minutes.

Non Convective SIGMET The criteria for a non convective SIGMET to be issued are severe or greater turbulence over a 3 000 square mile area or severe or greater icing over a 3 000 square mile area or IMC conditions over a 3 000 square mile area due to dust sand or volcanic ash.

Thus an example of a SIGMET report that could be included in the tailored dynamically updated weather report is 

The above SIGMET can be decoded as This is SIGMET ALFA 1 which is valid until 2100Z on the 5th day of the month. Affecting Arkansas Louisiana and Mississippi from KMEM airport to KJAN airport. It is issued because occasional severe icing above the freezing level is expected. The freezing level extends from 080 degrees east to 120 degrees west. Conditions continuing beyond 2100Z.

Convective SIGMET 54C is the 54th Convective SIGMET issued for the central region of the US on the 25th day of the month. Valid until 1855Z. States affected include Wisconsin and Illinois. Bounded within an area from 30 east of Madison Wis. to 40 miles east southeast of Dubuque Iowa. A diminishing line of thunderstorms 15 nautical miles wide moving from 300 degrees to the southeast at 25 knots. Thunderstorms tops to FL450 approximately 45 000 ft. MSL . Wind gusts to 50 knots are possible.

Convective SIGMET 55C is the 55th Convective SIGMET issued for the central region of the US on the 25th day of the month. Valid until 1855Z. States affected include Texas Oklahoma and New Mexico. Bounded within an area from 70 miles southeast of Tuba City Ariz. to 60 miles northwest of Amarillo Tex. to 40 northwest of Tucumcari N. Mex. to 30 miles east southeast of Cimarron N. Mex. to 70 miles southeast of Tuba City Ariz. An area of severe thunderstorms is moving from 330 degrees to the southeast at 25 knots. Thunderstorms tops to Flight Level 400 approximately 40 000 feet MSL . Hail up to 2 inches in diameter and wind gusts to 70 knots are possible.

In one embodiment the weather icon has colors associated with it for both Convective and Non Convective SIGMETs. In a further embodiment because SIGMETS warm of extreme weather conditions the presence of either a Convective or Non Convective SIGMET constitute examples of predetermined weather conditions that can both change the color of the weather icon and cause it to flash see blocks and of . For example in one embodiment a SIGMET being present in the weather report information block causes the weather icon to turn red and flash until acknowledged blocks with the SIGMET text highlighted in the weather report block .
