This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 638 074 filed Apr. 25 2012 and titled MEASURING ENGAGEMENT WITH A SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORM which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Electronic social networking platforms typically provide different mechanisms for enabling user identities to engage with the electronic social networking platforms.

In some implementations data is extracted from an electronic social networking platform about a particular user identity of the electronic social networking platform. In addition data also may be extracted from the electronic social networking platform about other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform. The extracted data then may be used to calculate numeric measures of the particular user identity s engagement with the electronic social networking platform and or numeric measures of the other user identities engagement with the electronic social networking platform. Information about the relative engagement of the other user identities with the electronic social networking platform then may be made available to the particular user identity e.g. via an electronic device and the particular user identity may be provided with the ability to manipulate the information. For example the particular user identity may be provided with the ability to filter the information based on one or more demographic or other characteristics of the other user identities.

There are many different examples of electronic social networking platforms. Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google MySpace and Orkut are just a few examples. But there are many others and it is reasonable to expect many more to be launched in the future. The techniques described herein for extracting and analyzing data from an electronic social networking platform are widely applicable and may be applied to any of the above electronic social networking platforms or any other electronic social networking platforms that enable data to be extracted.

Electronic social networking platforms frequently enable individual user identities e.g. users who have registered with a platform and or who have been assigned a unique or otherwise identifying identifier by the platform to establish connections with other user identities. These connections between user identities may reflect relationships between the underlying human users who correspond to the user identities. For example a connection between two user identities within an electronic social networking platform may reflect a social friendship e.g. developed through physical interaction in the real world and or through on line interaction in the cyber world or a professional relationship between the underlying human users who correspond to the user identities.

In some electronic social networking platforms a user identity may be able to unilaterally form a connection with another user identity. For example an electronic social networking platform may enable a first user identity to form a connection to a second user identity simply by specifying a desire to form a connection to the second user identity and without requiring approval of the connection by the second user identity. Alternatively in other electronic social networking platforms the formation of connections between two user identities may be a bilateral process. For example in such electronic social networking platforms when a first user identity specifies a desire to form a connection to a second user identity the electronic social networking platform may establish the connection only after the second user identity approves the formation of the connection between the first user identity and the second user identity.

The connections formed between individual user identities within an electronic social networking platform may be represented in the form of a graph where user identities are represented by nodes and connections between user identities are represented by edges connecting the nodes. Such a graph of interconnected user identities may change dynamically in time as new user identities join and old user identities quit the electronic social networking platform and or as new connections are formed and old connections are dissolved. Proximity between two user identities of an electronic social networking platform may be measured in terms of degrees of separation between the two user identities. For example proximity between two user identities of an electronic social networking platform may be calculated as the fewest number of edges required to form a path between the two user identities within the graph representing the connections between user identities of the electronic social networking platform.

A user identity of an electronic social networking platform may form a social network within the electronic social networking platform by forming connections to other user identities of the electronic social networking platform. In some cases the social network of a particular user identity of an electronic social networking platform may be defined as the group of other user identities to whom the particular user identity is directly connected. Alternatively in other cases the social network of a particular user identity of an electronic social networking platform may be defined to include a group of other user identities that are within a threshold number of degrees of separation of the particular user identity within the graph.

Electronic social networking platforms commonly facilitate sharing of information and the exchange of electronic communications between user identities and other user identities who are part of their social networks. In some implementations an electronic social networking platform may allow a particular user identity to access more detailed profile information about the other user identities who are part of the particular user identity s social network than the electronic social networking platform allows the particular user identity to access about user identities who are not part of the particular user identity s social network. For example an electronic social networking platform may allow a particular user identity to access information about the hometowns and or the current cities of residence of other user identities who are part of the particular user identity s social network but the electronic social networking platform may not allow the particular user identity to access this same information for user identities who are not part of the particular user identity s social network.

Additionally or alternatively an electronic social networking platform may provide communications conduits between a particular user identity and the other user identities who are part of the particular user identity s social network that the electronic social networking platform does not otherwise provide between the particular user identity and other user identities who are not part of the particular user identity s social network.

Furthermore some electronic social networking platforms may enable user identities to record information within the electronic social networking platforms about locations they have visited. In addition these electronic social networking platforms may enable a particular user identity to access such information about locations that members of the particular user identity s social network have registered with the social networking platforms. However these electronic social networking platforms may not allow a particular user identity to access similar information about locations that other user identities who are not members of the particular user identity s social network registered with the social networking platforms. In some electronic social networking platforms when a user identity registers a location that the user identity has visited messages may be broadcast to members of the user identity s social network reporting that the user identity has registered the location as a location that the user identity has visited.

Some electronic social networking platforms provide event management services. Among other features these event management services often enable user identities to generate events invite other user identities to attend such events and manage guest lists for the events e.g. manage RSVPs to the events from the invited user identities indicating that the user identities will be attending will not be attending tentatively will be attending etc. .

As discussed above in some cases an electronic social networking platform may define a particular user identity s social network as the group of other user identities to whom the user identity is directly connected. If this definition is applied within the electronic social networking platform illustrated in the social network for the user identity represented by node would be defined as the group of other user identities represented by nodes .

In addition to enabling a user identity to establish connections to other user identities and thereby form a social network some electronic social networking platforms may enable a particular user identity to divide the user identity s social network into one or more subsets of user identities who may for example share one or more characteristics of significance to the particular user identity. For example a particular user identity of an electronic social networking platform may wish to define subsets of user identities within the particular user identity s social network that reflect other user identities with whom the particular user identity has a familial relationship a professional relationship or a social relationship. For ease of reference such defined subsets of a particular user s social network may be referred to herein as Friendlists. 

As further discussed above an electronic social networking application may facilitate the sharing of information and the exchange of electronic communications between a particular user identity and other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network. For example referring to the electronic social networking platform represented in the electronic social networking application may provide mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of electronic communications between the user identity represented by node and the user identities represented by nodes who are part of the social network of the user identity represented by node . In some implementations the electronic social networking application may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node to send private electronic messages to any one or more of the user identities represented by nodes . Furthermore the electronic social networking application also may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node to broadcast an electronic message that is shared publicly with all or some defined subset of all such as for example one or more Friendlists of the user identities represented by nodes . Additionally or alternatively the electronic social networking application may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node to send a directed electronic message to a user identity that is represented by a particular one of nodes . In such cases the recipient user identity of the directed message may determine whether this directed message is shared publicly with other user identities of the electronic social networking platform.

In addition to enabling user identities to establish connections to other user identities some electronic social networking platforms enable user identities to establish connections with other types of objects. For example some social networking platforms may enable user identities to record information about their hometowns current places of residence or places they have visited including geographic locations e.g. such as cities states or countries as well as commercial venues local businesses or places e.g. such as restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. by establishing connections to location objects within the electronic social networking platforms. In some cases a user identity may be said to record a check in with an electronic social networking platform when the user identity records information within the electronic social networking platform about a location the user identity has visited. Some electronic social networking platforms also may enable user identities to record check ins on behalf of other user identities. For instance some electronic social networking platforms may enable members of a particular user identity s social network to record a check in on behalf of the particular user identity e.g. when the user identities visit a location together . In such scenarios the electronic social networking platform may record the location as a location the particular user identity visited even though the check in at the location was not initiated by the particular user identity.

Additionally or alternatively some social networking platforms may enable user identities to generate event objects within the electronic social networking platforms that represent events that they are hosting. After creating event objects for such events user identities may be provided with mechanisms for inviting other user identities to the events. Furthermore a connection may be established between an event object and a user identity within an electronic social networking platform as a result of the user identity being invited to the event and or as a result of the user identity registering with the electronic social networking platform that the user identity will be attending the event.

Similarly some social networking platforms may enable user identities to record endorsements of various different types of interests for example by establishing connections to interest objects that represent these interests. Such interest objects may include a variety of different types of objects including for example non personal enterprise objects. Examples of such non personal enterprise objects may include among others local businesses or places e.g. restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. companies organizations or institutions brands or products artists bands or public figures forms of entertainment e.g. books music albums movies etc. and causes or communities. As described in greater detail below in connection with in some electronic social networking platforms interest objects including non personal enterprise objects may be manifested within the electronic social networking platforms as so called pages. These pages especially pages associated with non personal enterprise interest objects may be maintained by one or more representatives of the interests or non personal enterprises represented by the objects. In addition among other features these pages may provide information about the interests or non personal enterprises represented by the objects. These pages also may provide conduits for enabling interaction between the interest or non personal enterprise objects and the user identities that have formed connections to the objects that represent them. Furthermore some electronic social networking platforms may enable pages like user identities to establish event objects related to events associated with the interest represented by the page.

Moreover some social networking platforms may enable user identities to establish connections with independent applications that leverage the social networking platforms for example by granting the independent applications authorization to access or extract data from the electronic social networking platform on their behalf.

An edge that connects two nodes represents a connection that has been formed between the two objects that are represented by the connected nodes . For example the edges that connect node to nodes represent connections that have been formed between the user identity represented by node and the user identities represented by nodes . For ease of reference such a connection between two user identity objects in an electronic social networking platform may be referred to herein as a friend connection. 

Similarly the edge that connects node to node represents a connection between the user identity represented by node and the non personal enterprise object represented by node . As discussed above a user of an electronic social networking platform may form a connection to such a non personal enterprise object in order to record an endorsement of the non personal enterprise represented by the object. Therefore for ease of reference connections between a user identity object and a non personal enterprise object in an electronic social networking platform may be referred to herein as an endorsement connection. 

Furthermore the edges that connect node to nodes represent connections that have been formed between the user identity represented by node and the location objects represented by nodes . Depending on the electronic social networking platform a user identity may be able to establish various different types of connections to location objects.

For example in order to store a record of the user identity s hometown the user identity may establish what may be referred to herein as a hometown connection to a location object that represents the user identity s hometown. Additionally or alternatively in order to store a record of the user identity s current residence the user identity may establish what may be referred to herein as a current city connection to a location object that represents the user identity s current residence.

Moreover in order to store a record of a place the user identity visited including geographic locations e.g. such as cities states or countries as well as commercial venues local businesses or places e.g. such as restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. the user identity may establish what may be referred to herein as a check in connection to a location object that represents a place that the user identity visited. In some cases an electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to manually check in at a location. For example a social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to manually define and or search for a location object that corresponds to a location that the user identity is visiting or has visited or plans to visit and create a connection to the location object that corresponds to the location in order to check in at the location. Additionally or alternatively an electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to check in at a location in a more intelligent or automated fashion. For instance a social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to check in at a location using a mobile computing device e.g. a smartphone or tablet computer using global positioning system GPS and or map data available to the mobile computing device.

Finally the edge that connects node to node represents a connection that has been formed between the user identity represented by node and the event represented by event object . For ease of reference such a connection between a user identity object and an event object may be referred to herein as event connections. There may be various different types of event connections between user identities and event objects in a social networking platform. For example one type of an event connection between a user identity and an event object in a social networking platform may signify that the user identity is the host of the event. Another type of an event connection between a user identity and an event object in a social networking platform may signify that the user identity has been invited to the event. Still another type of event connection between a user identity and an event object in a social networking platform may signify that the user identity has registered with the electronic social networking platform that the user identity will be attending the event. Yet another type of event connection between a user identity and an event object in a social networking platform may signify that the user identity has registered with the electronic social networking platform that the user identity will not be attending the event. Still one more type of event connection between a user identity and an event object in a social networking platform may signify that the user identity has registered with the electronic social networking platform that the user identity tentatively will be attending the event.

In some electronic social networking platforms that enable user identities to form connections with object types like location objects event objects and interest objects e.g. non personal enterprise objects such location objects event objects and or interest objects e.g. non personal enterprise objects each may be associated with one or more representatives. Furthermore the electronic social networking platforms may enable these representatives to interact with the user identities to whom the objects are connected using the manifestation of the object within the electronic social networking platform.

For example as described in greater detail below in connection with a non personal enterprise object within an electronic social networking platform may be manifested as a page that provides information about the non personal enterprise that the object represents and the electronic social networking platform may enable one or more designated representatives associated with the page to share information and exchange electronic communications with the user identities connected to the non personal enterprise object in a manner in which such shared information or exchanged communications appear to involve the page as opposed to an individual user identity. In one particular example the electronic social networking platform may provide a mechanism that enables one or more representatives associated with the non personal enterprise to broadcast an electronic message that is shared publicly with all or some defined subset of all of the user identities to which the non personal enterprise object is connected.

Additionally or alternatively an event object within an electronic social networking platform also may be manifested as an event page that provides information about the event the object represents e.g. date time and location information for the event and the electronic networking platform may enable one or more designated representatives associated with the event e.g. the hosts to share information and exchange electronic communications with user identities who have been invited to the event via the event page. In some electronic social networking platforms both personal user identities and non personal enterprise objects and their representatives may be able to create and host events.

Electronic social networking platforms often enable user identities to maintain user profiles or other collections of data that include information about the user identities to whom they correspond. Such a profile for an individual user identity of an electronic social networking platform may include among other information information about the user identity s hometown current residence age gender relationship status educational background and or professional background. Additionally or alternatively the profile for an individual user identity of an electronic social networking platform may include records of various different interests of the user identity e.g. endorsements of non personal enterprises or other interests .

In some electronic social networking platforms at least some of the profile information recorded for an individual user identity may be represented by connections between the user identity and other types of objects within the electronic social networking platforms. For example information about a user identity s hometown and or current residence may be represented as a connection between the user identity and one or more different location objects for example as described above in connection with . Additionally or alternatively information about a user identity s interests may be represented as connections between the user identity and one or more different interest objects e.g. non personal enterprise objects for example as also described above in connection with .

Some electronic social networking platforms provide mechanisms that enable independent applications to leverage the electronic social networking platforms to provide services to client computing devices that are in addition to the services provided by the electronic social networking platforms themselves. One common example of a type of independent application that leverages an electronic social networking platform is a gaming application. Such gaming applications often allow user identities to engage in interactive or multiplayer games that involve other user identities of the electronic social networking platforms that they leverage. Furthermore in some cases the gaming applications may transmit communications to user identities of the electronic social networking platforms within the electronic social networking platforms themselves. Additionally or alternatively some gaming applications may enable user identities to transmit messages that originate within the gaming applications to other user identities of the electronic social networking platform that are delivered to the other user identities within the electronic social networking platform.

The different examples of electronic social networking platforms described above may provide various different types of user interfaces for interacting with the electronic social networking platforms. In one particular example an electronic social networking platform may provide multiple different GUIs to a user identity to enable the user identity to interact with the underlying electronic social networking platform.

In this example the electronic social networking platform may provide a first GUI to the user identity that among other features presents to the user identity a feed that includes i electronic messages that have been shared with the user identity by other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network and or by other types of objects e.g. location event and interest objects to which the user identity is connected and or ii information about activities engaged in within the context of the electronic social networking platform by other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network. For ease of reference this feed presented to a user identity in the first GUI provided by the electronic social networking platform may be referred to herein as the user identity s news feed. 

In addition to the first GUI described above in connection with this example the electronic social networking platform also may provide a second GUI to the user identity that among other features presents to the user identity a feed that includes i electronic messages that have been shared by the personal user identity with members of the personal user identity s social network either in a broadcast or a directed fashion ii electronic messages that were shared with the user identity by members of the user identity s social network or in some cases by gaming applications that leverage the electronic social networking platform and that were directed specifically to the user identity that the user identity nevertheless may allow other members of the user identity s social network to view and iii information about activities engaged in within the context of the electronic social networking platform by the user identity. For ease of reference this feed presented to a user identity in the second GUI provided by the electronic social networking platform may be referred to as the user identity s personal feed. 

Referring first to GUI includes a news feed that includes different feed items . The items included within news feed include content and or electronic messages that have been shared with the particular user identity by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network. For example item includes a picture and a corresponding message shared with the particular user identity by a member of the particular user identity s social network identified as John. Similarly item includes a message shared with the particular user identity by a member of the particular user identity s social network identified as Jane and item includes a hyperlink to a web page and a corresponding message shared with the particular user identity by a member of the particular user identity s social network identified as Joe. Although not illustrated in in addition to enabling user identities to share pictures and hyperlinks with members of their social networks e.g. as illustrated by items and respectively the electronic social networking platform also may enable user identities to share other types of content with members of their social networks including for example videos.

Items and may represent content and or messages that the particular user identities who shared these items i.e. John Jane and Joe respectively shared generally with multiple members of their own social networks. For ease of reference messages and or content that user identities share as general broadcast messages to multiple members of their social networks such as for example picture and corresponding message of item message of item and hyperlink and corresponding message of item may be referred to herein as status posts. 

In addition to enabling user identities to send general broadcast messages to multiple members of their social networks the electronic social networking platform also may enable user identities to send directed messages to individual user identities within their social networks. Such directed messages may be presented to the user identities to whom they are targeted within the targeted user identities personal feeds and the electronic social networking platform may provide user identities with controls for configuring whether such directed messages also are shared with members of the targeted user identities own social networks. In the event that a targeted user identity selects configuration settings that provide for directed messages to the targeted user to be shared with other members of the targeted user identity s social network such directed messages may be presented to the other members of the targeted user identity s social network in their news feeds. 

Item in the news feed of the GUI for a particular user identity of the electronic social networking platform is an example of a message that was directed to a targeted user identity who is a member of the particular user identity s social network and who selected configuration settings that provided for the directed message to be shared with other members of the targeted user identity s own social network. More particularly message was directed to a member of the particular user identity s social network identified as John by another user identity identified as Jane. Because the user identity identified as John is a member of the particular user identity s social network and because the user identity identified as John selected configuration settings that provide for directed messages that target the user identity identified as John to be shared with other members of his social network the directed message from the user identity identified as Jane to the user identity identified as John is presented in the particular user identity s news feed . The user identity identified as Jane may or may not be a member of the particular user identity s own social network.

 News feed also includes information about activities engaged in within the context of the electronic social networking platform by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network. For example item indicates that a user identity identified as Joe checked in at a location identified as World Caf . The location World Caf may be represented as a location object within the electronic social networking platform and may correspond to for example a local restaurant.

The items included within news feed also include content and or electronic messages that have been shared with the particular user identity by other types of objects e.g. location event and interest objects to which the user identity is connected. For example item includes a message shared with the particular user identity by a non personal enterprise object identified as MicroStrategy.

If the particular user identity is connected to a large number of non personal enterprise objects or other types of interest objects that frequently share messages the particular user identity s news feed may be cluttered with messages shared by such non personal enterprise objects or other types of interest objects . Consequently the particular user identity may miss gloss over or otherwise fail to appreciate messages posted by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network. Additionally or alternatively if a large number of items continuously cycle through the particular user identity s news feed the particular user identity may miss gloss over or otherwise fail to appreciate messages of some level of significance to the particular user identity posted by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network.

Invitations to events that a user identity receives within the electronic social networking platform also may be presented in the user identity s news feed. For example item in news feed represents an invitation to an event named Housewarming Party being held on April 17 in Washington D.C. that was sent to the particular user identity by a user identity who is a member of the particular user identity s social network identified as Joe. As illustrated in item includes a selectable View control that when invoked may provide the particular user identity with more information about the Housewarming Party event. In addition item also includes a selectable Join control that enables the particular user identity to register with the electronic social networking platform that the particular user identity will be attending the Housewarming Party event. As discussed above the Housewarming Party event may be represented as an event object within the electronic social networking platform.

The items presented in news feed provide mechanisms that enable the particular user identity to react to the objects included within the items presented in news feed . For example as illustrated in each of the items presented in news feed includes a selectable Endorse control and a selectable Comment control . A selectable Endorse control in an item enables the particular user identity to register an endorsement of the object s e.g. content message and or activity included in the item . The electronic social networking platform records such endorsements and may present the number of endorsements registered in connection with the object s presented in an item in connection with the presentation of the item itself. For example item includes an indication that six different user identities have registered endorsements of the picture and message included in item .

A selectable Comment control in an item enables the particular user identity to enter a responsive comment to the object s included in the item . The electronic social networking platform records such responsive comments and associates them with the object s included in the item so that the electronic social networking platform may present any such responsive comments in connection with the presentation of the item itself. For example item includes a message by a user identity identified as Joe that was entered in response to the message originally shared by the user identity identified as Jane.

In addition to news feed GUI also includes a selectable Post Message control a selectable Share Photo Video control and an associated text entry field and selectable Post control . Selectable Post Message control enables the particular user identity to compose and post a status message by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control . Similarly selectable Share Photo Video control enables the particular user identity to share a picture or a video and to compose and post a corresponding status message by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control .

Referring now to GUI includes a personal feed that includes different feed items . The items included within personal feed include content and or electronic messages that the particular user identity shared with other members of the particular user identity s social network. Such content and or electronic messages may include status posts that the particular user identity broadcasted generally to multiple members of the particular user identity s social network responsive comments that the particular user identity entered in response to content and or messages shared by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network and directed messages that the particular user identity shared with specifically targeted individual user identity s who are members of the particular user identity s social network.

For example item includes a status post that the particular user identity broadcasted generally to multiple members of the particular user identity s social network. Similarly item includes a picture and a corresponding message that the particular user identity broadcasted generally to multiple members of the particular user identity s social network. To the extent that members of the particular user identity s social network enter responsive comments to and or endorse status posts that the particular user identity broadcasts generally to multiple members of the particular user identity s social network any such responsive comments or endorsements also may be presented within personal feed . For example item includes an indication that two user identities have endorsed message . Similarly item includes a message that was entered by a member of the particular user identity s social network identified by the user identity Joe in response to the picture and corresponding message originally posted by the particular user identity.

Meanwhile item includes a responsive comment that the particular user identity entered in response to content and or a message shared by a member of the particular user identity s social network identified by the user identity John. Item also includes a directed message that the particular user identity shared with a specifically targeted member of the particular user identity s social network identified by the user identity Joe.

The items included in personal feed also include content and or messages that were shared with the particular user identity by members of the particular user identity s social network and that were directed specifically to the particular user identity. For example item includes a message that was shared with the particular user identity by a member of the particular user identity s social network identified by user identity Jane and that was directed specifically to the particular user identity.

In addition the items in personal feed also include information about activities engaged in by the particular user identity within the context of the electronic social networking platform. For example item includes an indication that the particular user identity has endorsed a non personal enterprise object identified as MicroStrategy as well as four additional interest objects all of which as described in greater detail below in connection with may be manifested within the electronic social networking platform in the form of individual pages. Meanwhile item includes an indication that the particular user identity has established a connection within the electronic social networking platform to the user identity identified as Jane.

Although not illustrated in a user identity s personal feed also may include content and or messages that were shared with the particular user identity as a consequence of the user identity s interaction with an application e.g. a gaming application that leverages the electronic social networking platform. For example in some cases an application that leverages the electronic social networking application may post messages in the user identity s personal feed. Additionally or alternatively another user identity may originate a message to the user identity within an application that leverages the electronic social networking platform and the application then may cause the message from the other user identity that originated within the application to be posted to the user identity s personal feed. 

In addition to personal feed GUI also includes a profile section with profile information for the particular user identity. As illustrated in profile section indicates that the particular user identity is identified by user identity James and includes profile information that specifies the particular user identity s professional background software developer alma mater Massachusetts Institute of Technology current residence Washington D.C. hometown Chicago and birthday July 4 .

As with GUI GUI also includes a selectable Post Message control a selectable Share Photo Video control and an associated text entry field and selectable Post control . Selectable Post Message control enables the particular user identity to compose and post a status message by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control . Similarly selectable Share Photo Video control enables the particular user identity to share a picture or a video and to compose and post a corresponding status message by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control .

As discussed above in some electronic social networking platforms interests may be represented as interest objects that are manifested within the electronic social networking platform as pages. is a diagram of an example of a GUI for an example of an electronic social networking platform within which interests are represented as interest objects that are manifested within the electronic social networking platform as pages. More particularly GUI is displaying an interest page that represents an interest object for a non personal enterprise identified as MicroStrategy. As illustrated in the MicroStrategy interest page includes an information section that provides background information about MicroStrategy. The MicroStrategy interest page also includes a feed that includes among other content messages generated by the MicroStrategy interest page and shared with one or more other user identities of the electronic social networking platform to which the MicroStrategy interest page is connected e.g. one or more user identities who have recorded with the electronic social networking platform endorsements of the MicroStrategy interest object represented by the MicroStrategy interest page . In addition as further illustrated in the feed also includes directed messages posted to the MicroStrategy interest page by user identities of the electronic social networking platform. For example a user identity of the electronic social networking platform may post a message to the MicroStrategy interest page by entering text in text entry field and invoking selectable Post control . Although not illustrated as such in feed also may include various additional or alternative types of content.

Notably MicroStrategy interest page also includes a selectable Endorse control that enables user identities who view the MicroStrategy interest page and who have not already endorsed MicroStrategy to record an endorsement of MicroStrategy as one of their interests. In response to invocation of selectable endorse control by a particular user identity the electronic social networking platform records that the particular user identity has endorsed MicroStrategy as an interest for example by establishing a connection between the object that represents the particular user identity in the platform and the interest object that represents MicroStrategy within the electronic social networking platform. MicroStrategy interest page also includes an indication reporting that 7 443 user identities already have endorsed MicroStrategy within the electronic social networking platform.

In some electronic social networking platforms interests endorsed by a particular user identity may be shared with or otherwise made available to other user identities of the electronic social networking platform. In particular in some electronic social networking platforms interests endorsed by a particular user identity may be shared with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network. For example an electronic social networking platform may provide user identities who are members of a particular user identity s social network with access to a detailed user identity profile page that includes among other information indications of interests that the particular user identity has endorsed within the electronic social networking platform.

A social intelligence application that is external to an electronic social networking platform but that nevertheless leverages the electronic social networking platform may extract data from the electronic social networking platform that is available to different user identities of the electronic social networking platform. Thereafter the social intelligence service may process the extracted content and represent the extracted content and or generate reports about the extracted content so as to enable the individual user identities to glean better intelligence from the data that is available to them within the electronic social networking platform.

For example as described in greater detail below a social intelligence application may extract data about a particular user identity and other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network from an electronic social networking platform. The social intelligence application then may process this extracted data to determine relative measures of engagement with the electronic social networking platform by the other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform. Consequently the social intelligence application may enable the particular user identity to identify members of the particular user identity s social network who are particularly active communicative popular and or influential within the context of the electronic social networking platform. Additionally or alternatively the social intelligence application also may enable the particular user identity to gain a better understanding of the frequency with which the particular user identity interacts with individual members of the particular user identity s social network within the context of the electronic social networking platform.

As illustrated in communications system includes an electronic social networking platform that is accessible to a number of computing devices including for example a laptop computer a tablet computer and a smartphone over a network . In addition communications system also includes a computing system . Computing system may be external to electronic social networking platform . As such electronic social networking platform may be accessible to computing system over network . Additionally computing system may be accessible to computing devices over network .

Electronic social networking platform may be implemented using one or more computing devices e.g. servers configured to provide a service to one or more client devices e.g. computing devices connected to electronic social networking platform over network . The one or more computing devices on which electronic social networking platform is implemented may have internal or external storage components storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. The one or more application programs may be implemented as instructions that are stored in the storage components and that when executed cause the one or more computing devices to provide the features of an electronic social networking platform . Furthermore the one or more computing devices on which electronic social networking platform is implemented each may include one or more processors for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . In addition these computing devices also typically may include network interfaces and communication devices for sending and receiving data. Electronic social networking platform also may provide an application programming interface API that enables other applications to interact with and extract data from the electronic social networking platform .

Computing devices may be any of a number of different types of computing devices including for example mobile phones smartphones personal digital assistants laptop tablet and netbook computers and desktop computers including personal computers special purpose computers general purpose computers and or combinations of special purpose and general purpose computers. Each of the computing devices typically may have internal or external storage components for storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. In particular the internal or external storage components for each of the computing devices may store a client application for interfacing with electronic social networking platform and or a client application for interfacing with computing system . Additionally or alternatively computing devices may be configured to interface with electronic social networking platform or computing system without a specific client application using for example a web browser.

Each of the computing devices also typically may include a central processing unit CPU for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . Each of the computing devices also usually may include one or more communication devices for sending and receiving data. One example of such communications devices is a modem. Other examples include antennas transceivers communications cards and other network adapters capable of transmitting and receiving data over a network e.g. network through a wired or wireless data pathway.

Network may provide direct or indirect communication links between electronic social networking platform computing devices and computing system . Examples of network include the Internet the World Wide Web wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs including wireless LANs WLANs analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks radio television cable satellite and or any other delivery mechanisms for carrying data.

Computing system may be implemented using one or more computing devices e.g. servers . The one or more computing devices on which computing system is implemented may have internal or external storage components storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. The one or more application programs may be implemented as instructions that are stored in the storage components and that when executed cause the one or more computing devices to provide the features ascribed herein to the computing system . Furthermore the one or more computing devices on which computing system is implemented each may include one or more processors for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . In addition these computing devices also typically may include network interfaces and communication devices for sending and receiving data.

Computing system hosts a social intelligence application. As such computing system is configured to extract and process data from one or more electronic social networking platforms e.g. electronic social networking platform . For example computing system may be configured to exploit API to extract data from electronic social networking platform . Among other features computing system may be configured to extract data about multiple different user identities social networks including i information about the members of each user identity s social network ii communications shared with each user identity as well as communications shared with each member of the user identity s social network iii information about interest objects that each user identity has endorsed as well as information about interest objects that each member of the user identity s social network has endorsed iv information about locations where each user identity has checked in as well as information about locations where each member of the user identity s social network has checked in and v information about events to which each user identity has been invited as well as information about events to which each member of the user identity s social network has been invited.

In some implementations electronic social networking platform may enable individual user identities to grant computing system a token that defines permission levels related to data about the user identities social networks that computing system may access and extract from electronic social networking platform . For each individual user identity for which computing system has a token computing system may extract information about the user identity and the other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network. This information may include identifying information for the user identity and each member of the user identity s social network as well as demographic information for the user identity and each member of the user identity s social network e.g. hometown current residence age or date of birth gender relationship status etc. . For each individual user identity for which computing system has a token computing system also may extract communications that the user identity shared with other user identities as well as communications that have been shared with the user identity. In addition for each individual user identity for which computing system has a token computing system also may extract information about interest objects the user identity has endorsed information about locations where the user identity has checked in information about events to which the user identity has been invited and or information about applications that leverage the electronic social networking platform that the user identity uses. Additionally or alternatively for each individual user identity for which computing system has a token computing system also may extract communications that members of the user identity s social network have shared with other user identities as well as communications that other user identities shared with members of the user identity s social network. In addition for each individual user identity for which computing system has a token computing system also may extract information about interest objects that members of the user identity s social network have endorsed information about locations where members of the user identity s social network have checked in information about events to which members of the user identity s social network have been invited and or information about applications that leverage the electronic social networking platform that the members of the user identity s social network use.

In some implementations after extracting data from electronic social networking platform computing system may store the extracted data in one more databases. For example computing system may store information extracted from electronic social networking platform in one or more on line transaction processing OLTP databases. Such OLTP databases may be implemented as relational or other forms of databases Computing system then may process the extracted data stored in the database s and load the processed data into a data warehouse e.g. an on line analytical processing OLAP data warehouse that may facilitate reporting and analysis of the processed data. Computing system then may provide individual user identities for which computing system has tokens with access to subsets of the processed data that correspond to data extracted from electronic social networking platform using their tokens.

For example for each individual user identity for which computing system has a token computing system may process data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to determine relative measures of engagement with the electronic social networking platform by members of the user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform . The computing system then may provide the individual user identities with access to information about the relative measures of engagement with the electronic social networking platform by members of their social networks.

The individual user identities may utilize various different computing devices e.g. computing devices communicatively coupled to computing system via network to access the subsets of the processed data made available to the user identities by computing system . In addition to providing individual user identities with access to the processed data computing system also may provide these individual user identities with various analysis and reporting tools for manipulating the data included within the subsets of the processed data to which the individual user identities are provided access. Additionally or alternatively such analysis and reporting tools may be provided within a client application resident on a computing device that an individual user identity uses to access the processed data made available by computing system .

Among other reporting and analysis tools computing system and or the client application used to access computing system may provide the user identities with filtering tools that enable the user identity to identify different segments of members within the user identity s social network e.g. based on demographic characteristics such as current residence age gender and or relationship status and analyze the engagement with the electronic social networking platform of the members of the different segments of the user identity s social network.

A social intelligence application that provides individual user identities of an electronic social networking platform with access to the extracted and processed data as described above and or that provides the individual user identities with reporting and analysis tools for manipulating such extracted and processed data may enable the individual user identities to glean better intelligence from the wealth of data available to them within the electronic social networking platform.

Referring now to GUI provides an aggregated view of user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform that reflects relative levels of outreach by the particular user identity within the electronic social networking platform to user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network. In particular GUI presents a list of user identities column who are members of the particular user identity s social network ranked column according to numeric measures of the particular user identity s outreach to the user identities within the electronic social networking platform over the previous 30 days. In addition GUI presents various different statistics about the particular user identity s outreach to each of the listed user identities within the electronic social networking platform over the previous 30 days that the social intelligence application uses to calculate numeric measures of the particular user identity s outreach to the user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform.

The computing system extracts data from the electronic social networking platform that reveals user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform .

Then based on knowing the user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform the computing system extracts data from the electronic social networking platform that reveals engagement with the electronic social networking platform by the user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform .

In some implementations the computing system optionally may enable filtering of the aggregated view of the user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network according to demographic characteristics of the user identities . Additionally or alternatively the computing system also optionally may enable filtering of the aggregated view of the user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network to include only user identities who belong to one or more predefined subsets of user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform .

The computing system extracts targeted messages that were directed to the particular user identity of the electronic social networking platform from the electronic social networking platform . In some implementations the computing system may extract targeted messages that were directed to the particular user identity during a defined window of time e.g. the previous week the previous month or 30 days the previous 3 months or 90 days the previous 6 months or 180 days the previous year etc. .

The computing system then determines the number of targeted messages directed to the particular user identity that were extracted . In some implementations the computing system may determine the number of targeted messages that were directed to the particular user identity within a defined window of time e.g. the previous week the previous month or 30 days the previous 3 months or 90 days the previous 6 months or 180 days the previous year etc. . In some implementations as part of determining the number of targeted messages directed to the particular user identity the computing system optionally also may determine the number of general targeted messages that were directed to the particular user identity personally by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network e.g. the number of non birthday related targeted messages that were directed to the particular user identity personally by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network . Additionally or alternatively the computing system optionally also may determine the number of birthday related targeted messages that were directed to the particular user identity personally by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network . Examples of techniques for classifying posts as being birthday related are described below in connection with and . Similarly the computing system optionally also may determine the number of targeted messages directed to the particular user identity that originated from gaming applications that leverage the electronic social networking platform .

In addition to determining the number of targeted messages that were directed to the particular user identity the computing system also determines the number of unique user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network who personally sent targeted messages directed to the particular user identity . In some implementations the computing system may determine the number of unique user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network who personally sent targeted messages directed to the particular user identity within a defined window of time e.g. the previous week the previous month or 30 days the previous 3 months or 90 days the previous 6 months or 180 days the previous year etc. .

In some implementations the computing system also optionally may extract data that reveals events to which the particular user identity has received invitations within the electronic social networking platform . In such implementations the computing system may use this extracted information to determine the number of events to which the particular user identity has received invitations for which at least a defined percentage of the invitees have accepted their invitations . In some cases the computing system may determine the number of events to which the particular user identity has received invitations within a defined window of time e.g. the previous week the previous month or 30 days the previous 3 months or 90 days the previous 6 months or 180 days the previous year etc. for which at least a defined percentage of the invitees have accepted their invitations.

The computing system also calculates a numeric measure of the particular user identity s popularity as a function of the number of targeted messages directed to the particular user identity e.g. during a defined window of time and the number of unique user identities who personally sent targeted messages directed to the particular user identity e.g. during the defined window of time .

In some particular implementations the computing system may calculate a numeric measure of the particular user identity s popularity as a function of the number of general targeted messages directed to the particular user identity e.g. during the defined window of time the number of birthday related targeted messages directed to the particular user identity e.g. during the defined window of time the number of targeted messages directed to the particular user identity that originated from gaming applications e.g. during the defined window of time the number of unique user identities who personally sent targeted messages directed to the particular user identity e.g. during the defined window of time and the number of events to which the particular user identity received invitations e.g. during the defined window of time for which at least a defined percentage of invitees have accepted their invitations . For example the computing system may calculate a numeric measure of the particular user identity s popularity according to the formula for calculating popularity set forth above in connection with the discussion of .

The computing system extracts posts generally broadcast by the particular user identity to other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network . In some implementations the computing system may extract posts generally broadcast by the particular user identity to other user identities during a defined window of time e.g. the previous week the previous month or 30 days the previous 3 months or 90 days the previous 6 months or 180 days the previous year etc. .

In addition the computing system extracts data revealing responsive comments to the extracted status posts that were received from other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform . The computing system then may use this extracted data to determine the number of responsive comments to the extracted status posts that were received from members of the particular user identity s social network . In some implementations the computing system also optionally may determine the number of unique user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network from whom responsive comments to the extracted status posts were received .

The computing system also extracts data revealing endorsements of the extracted status posts that were received from user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform . The computing system then may use this extracted data to determine the number endorsements of the extracted status posts that were received from user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform . In some implementations the computing system also optionally may determine the number of unique user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network from whom endorsements of the extracted status posts were received .

The computing system then determines the average number of responsive comments and endorsements that were received for the extracted status posts . Thereafter the computing system calculates a numeric measure of the particular user identity s influence within the electronic social networking platform as a function of the average number of responsive comments and endorsements received for the extracted status posts . In some particular implementations the computing system may calculate a numeric measure of the particular user identity s influence as a function of the average number of comments and endorsements received per extracted status post the number of responsive comments to the extracted status posts the number of endorsements of the extracted status posts the number of unique user identities from whom responsive comments to the extracted status posts were received and the number of unique user identities from whom endorsements of the extracted status posts were received. For example the computing system may calculate a numeric measure of the particular user identity s influence according to the formula for calculating influence set forth above in connection with the discussion of .

As discussed above in some implementations calculating a numeric measure of a user identity s engagement with an electronic social networking platform may involve determining whether communications exchanged by or with the user identity within the electronic social networking platform are birthday related and or whether such communications are happy communications or unhappy communications. As such examples of techniques for categorizing communications e.g. as birthday related happy and or unhappy communications are described below in connection with and .

The computing system accesses a text string . For example the computing system access a message shared with a user identity within an electronic social networking platform. The computing system also accesses an index e.g. a radix tree of one or more indicators that are indicative of a category . For example the category may be one of a happy mood an unhappy mood and birthday related.

After accessing the text string the computing system also identifies one or more words within the accessed text string . For example the computing system may identify words within the accessed text string by identifying breaks between characters in the accessed text string. After identifying the words within the accessed text string the computing system searches for one or more of the indicators that that are indicative of the category within the identified words of the text string . If the computing system determines that an indicator indicative of the category is present in the text string based on having searched for the indicators within the identified words of the text string the computing system categorizes the text string as belonging to the category and stores an indication that the text string has been categorized as belonging to the category in computer readable storage media .

The computing system determines if the message includes any emoticons . If the computing system determines that the message includes an emoticon the computing system proceeds to determine if the emoticon identified in the message matches any target emoticons identified as being indicative of certain categories . For example in some implementations a first set of target emoticons may be identified as being indicative of happy messages and a second set of target emoticons may be identified as being indicative of unhappy messages. An example of a set of emoticons that may be indicative of happy messages is presented in Table 1 and an example of a set of emoticons that may be indicative of unhappy messages in presented in Table 2. In such implementations the computing system may compare the emoticon identified within the message to the first and second sets of emoticons to determine if the emoticon identified within the message matches any of the emoticons in the first and second sets of emoticons.

If the computing system determines that the emoticon identified in the message matches a target emoticon identified as being indicative of a certain category the computing system categorizes the message as belonging to the category of the target emoticon that the emoticon identified within the message matched . For example if the computing system determines that the emoticon identified within the message matches one of the emoticons presented in Table 1 the computing system may categorize the message as a happy message. Similarly if the computing system determines that the emoticon identified within the message matches one of the emoticons presented in Table 2 the computing system may categorize the message as an unhappy message. In addition to determining if the emoticon identified within the message matches any target emoticons the computing system also may replace the emoticon identified within the message with a period i.e. . . The computing system may repeat operations and for all emoticons identified in the message.

In addition to identifying emoticons in the message the computing system also may determine if the message includes any uniform resource locators URLs . For example the computing system may search the message for character strings beginning with the prefixes http or https and identify as a URL any character string that begins with one of these prefixes. The computing system also may search the message for other character strings or patterns that frequently appear in URLs to identify URLs within the message for example in the event that ULRs that do not include the http or https are present within the message. If the computing system determines that the message includes a URL the computing system removes the URL from the message . This operation may be repeated for all URLs identified in the message.

In addition to identifying URLs in the message the computing system also determines if the message includes instances of repeated punctuation marks . If the computing system determines that the message includes an instance of a repeated punctuation mark the computing system replaces the repeated punctuation mark with a single instance of the punctuation mark . For example if the computing system recognizes a repeated string of periods e.g. ..... the computing system may replace the repeated string of periods with a single period e.g. . . Similarly if the computing system recognizes a repeated string of question marks e.g. or a repeated string of exclamation marks e.g. the computing system may replace the repeated string of question marks with a single question mark e.g. or the repeated string of exclamation marks with a single exclamation mark e.g. . This operation may be repeated for all instances of repeated punctuation marks in the message

The computing system also determines if the message includes any instances of so called chat slang e.g. hehehe or hahaha . If the computing system determines that the message includes an instance of chat slang the computing system removes the chat slang from the message . This operation may be repeated for all instances of chat slang identified in the message.

After removing any emoticons URLs repeated punctuation marks and or chat slang from the message the computing system then determines if any text remains in the message . If no text remains in the message at this point the process ends. Alternatively if text remains in the message the computing system attempts to identify one or more candidate languages for the message . An example of a process for identifying candidate languages for a message is illustrated and described in greater detail below in connection with . If the computing system is unable to identify a candidate language for the message the process ends. Alternatively if the computing system is able to identify one or more candidate languages for the message the computing system proceeds.

As described in greater detail below in some implementations the computing system attempts to categorize the message based on the appearance of certain category indicators e.g. words terms phrases strings patterns etc. in the message. In some implementations the computing system may maintain different sets of category indicators for each of several different languages. Thus the computing system may attempt to identify at least two different candidate languages for the message and then the computing system may attempt to categorize the message using the sets of category indicators for each of the different candidate languages.

After identifying one or more candidate languages for the message the computing system identifies individual sentences within the post . For example the computing system may identify individual sentences within the message by identifying text strings that conclude with certain sentence ending punctuation marks e.g. periods . question marks or exclamation marks .

For each sentence identified within the message the computing system then searches the sentence for category indicators that match category indicator lists for each of the candidate languages identified for the message . An example of a process for searching text for category indicators that match category indicator lists is illustrated and described in greater detail below in connection with . Category indicator lists may be available for a number of different categories in a number of different languages. For example category indicator lists may be available for categorizing messages as happy or unhappy or as being birthday related. Example category indicator lists for each of these categories for the English language are provided in Tables 3 5 below.

Within the example category indicator lists presented in Tables 3 5 above the notations presented below in Table 6 may be used to indicate different rules 

Still referring to if the computing system detects that the sentence includes matches to one or more of the category indicator lists for the candidate language the computing system categorizes the message from which the sentence was taken as belonging to the category of the indicator list s for which matches were found in the sentence . The computing system may repeat these operations for each sentence identified within the message. After each sentence within the message has been searched for category indicators that match category indicator lists for each of the candidate languages identified for the message the process may end.

In some implementations instead of searching individual sentences of a post for matches to category indicator lists an entire post itself may be searched for matches to category indicator lists irrespective of the number of sentences within the post.

In some implementations the computing system also may search the message for the word not. In such implementations if the computing system has categorized a message as being a happy message or a sad message and the computing system determines that the word not is present in the message the computing system may reverse the happy or sad categorization. For example if the computing system has categorized a message as being a happy message and the computing system detects the word not as being present in the message the computing system may remove the happy categorization for the message. Similarly if the computing system has categorized the message as being unhappy and the computing system detects the word not as being present in the message the computing system may remove the unhappy categorization for the message.

The computing system converts the characters of the message into their UTF 8 hexadecimal representations . Taking the input message new car as an example the computing system would convert the input message to 6E 65 57 20 63 61 72. 

The computing system then uses the UTF 8 hexadecimal representations of the characters in the post to generate trigrams of the UTF 8 hexadecimal byte sequences for the characters in the post . Taking the input message new car again as an example the computing system would generate the following trigrams of UTF 8 hexadecimal byte sequences 6E 65 57 65 57 20 57 20 63 20 63 61 and 63 61 72. 

The computing system then generates a frequency weighted trigram distribution vector for the message . For example the computing system may generate a trigram distribution vector for the message in which each trigram in the message is represented by a corresponding element in the vector and in which the elements of the vector are weighted according to the number of times the trigrams to which they correspond appear in the message.

The computing system then compares the frequency weighted trigram distribution vector for the message to trigram distribution vectors or alternatively trigram distribution tries for multiple different candidate language models . These trigram distribution vectors or trigram distribution tries for the different candidate language models may be derived from a common document that is translated into each of the different candidate languages. For example a document such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights may be translated into each of the different candidate languages. Each of the resulting versions of the document then may be converted into UTF 8 hexadecimal byte sequence trigrams from which a trigram distribution vector or a trigram distribution trie for the candidate language may be generated.

Based on comparing the frequency weighted trigram distribution vector for the message to the trigram distribution vectors or the trigram distribution tries for the different candidate language models the computing system calculates language match scores for the message for each of the candidate languages . For example the language match score R for the message for an individual one of the candidate language models may be calculated according to the following equation 

After calculating the language match scores for the message for each of the candidate languages the computing system then determines if the message sufficiently matches one or more of the candidate language models . For example the computing system may determine that the message sufficiently matches one of the candidate language models if the language match score for the message for the candidate language exceeds some predefined threshold value.

If the computing system determines that the message sufficiently matches one or more of the candidate language models the process returns indications of the language s for which the message was determined to sufficiently match the candidate language model s . The process then may end. In some implementations if the message is determined to sufficiently match multiple candidate language models the computing system may limit the languages returned to some predefined number of languages that the message is determined to match most closely.

Alternatively if the message does not sufficiently match any of the candidate language models the process returns a value indicating that no matches were identified . The process then may end.

The computing system accesses one or more radix tree representations of the category indicator lists . In some implementations if there are multiple category indicator lists all of the category indicator lists may be represented in a single radix tree. In other implementations each category indicator list may be represented by its own radix tree.

The computing system then identifies an individual word within the text and searches the radix tree representation s of the category indicator lists for strings that match the identified word and or strings that match substrings within the identified word . If the computing system finds a match the computing system assigns the identified word an integer value that represents the match and that is specified in the node that represents the matched string within the radix tree representation s of the category indicator lists . Alternatively if the computing system does not find a match the computing system assigns the identified word an integer value that reflects the absence of a match e.g. 1 .

The computing system then determines if additional words remain in the text and if so repeats this radix tree based string matching for each word identified within the text. As a result the computing system converts the text into a sequence of integers. The computing system then compares the integer sequence for the text to integer representations of the category indicators specified in the category indicator lists and attempts to identify matches between the integer sequence representation of the text and the integer representations of the category indicators specified in the category indicator lists .

If the computing system determines that there are one or more matches between the integer sequence representation of the text and the integer representations of the category indicators the computing system returns the category or categories of the category indicator lists for which matches were found in the integer sequence representation of the text . The process then may end. Alternatively if the computing system determines that there are no matches between the integer sequence representation of the text and the integer representations of the category indicators the computing system returns an indication that no matches were found . The process then may end.

A number of methods techniques systems and apparatuses have been described. Nevertheless various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of this disclosure.
