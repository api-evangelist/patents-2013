This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 646 223 filed May. 11 2012.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station or a transceiver node and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE Rel. 8 9 and 10 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 2012 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In a 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE system the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicate with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

In homogeneous networks the node also called a macro node can provide basic wireless coverage to wireless devices in a cell. The cell can be the area in which the wireless devices are operable to communicate with the macro node. Heterogeneous networks HetNets can be used to handle the increased traffic loads on the macro nodes due to increased usage and functionality of wireless devices. HetNets can include a layer of planned high power macro nodes or macro eNBs overlaid with layers of lower power nodes small eNBs micro eNBs pico eNBs femto eNBs or home eNBs HeNBs that can be deployed in a less well planned or even entirely uncoordinated manner within the coverage area cell of a macro node. The lower power nodes LPNs can generally be referred to as low power nodes small nodes or small cells.

The macro node can be used for basic coverage. The low power nodes can be used to fill coverage holes within a macro node s geographic coverage area i.e. cell and at the boundaries between the macro nodes coverage areas. Low power nodes can also be used to improve capacity in high use areas and improve indoor coverage where building structures impede signal transmission.

Homogeneous networks or HetNets can use time division duplexing TDD or frequency division duplexing FDD for DL or UL transmissions. Time division duplexing TDD is an application of time division multiplexing TDM to separate downlink and uplink signals. In TDD downlink signals and uplink signals may be carried on a same carrier frequency where the downlink signals use a different time interval from the uplink signals so the downlink signals and the uplink signals do not generate interference for each other. TDM is a type of digital multiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals such as a downlink or uplink are transferred apparently simultaneously as sub channels in one communication channel but are physically transmitted on different resources. In frequency division duplexing FDD an uplink transmission and a downlink transmission can operate using different frequency carriers. In FDD interference can be avoided because the downlink signals use a different frequency carrier from the uplink signals.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

As used herein the term substantially refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action characteristic property state structure item or result. For example an object that is substantially enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of substantially is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action characteristic property state structure item or result.

As used herein the terms node and cell are both intended to be synonymous and refer to a wireless transmission point operable to communicate with multiple user equipment such as an eNodeB or a low power node.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The following definitions are provided for clarity of the overview and embodiments described below.

A potentially large number of low power nodes such as pico nodes may exist within the geographic region covered by a macro eNB. For example illustrates a macro eNB that provides coverage area . Within this coverage area are two pico cells which can be used to improve capacity in high use areas by allowing the macro eNB to offload to the pico cells . Another pico cell is illustrated as existing on the edge of the coverage area . The pico cell can be used to fill coverage holes within the macro node s coverage area and at the boundaries between the macro nodes coverage area as shown in .

While three pico nodes are illustrated within the coverage area of the macro node a macro node s coverage area may include hundreds or even thousands of pico nodes. For example pico nodes configured as HeNBs may be located in hundreds or thousands of homes that are within the coverage area of a single macro node.

Frequent handover can occur if a user equipment UE is moving around relative to a large number of low power nodes located within the macro node s coverage area. Frequent handover is typically not desirable since the handover process as outlined in the 3GPP LTE specifications Rel. 8 9 and 10 entails a fairly large number of overhead messages such as radio resource control RRC signaling messages that are communicated between the UE and the wireless network. In addition handover can also entail additional overhead including physical layer reconfiguration and uplink synchronization with random access when a UE enters the coverage area of a new node such as an LPN.

A brief review of a wireless network is provided for clarity. illustrates an example of a 3GPP LTE radio access network RAN system. The system operates based on the 3GPP LTE specification such as releases 8 9 10 and 11. The wireless network illustrated in is comprised of a RAN and an evolved packet core EPC . For 3GPP LTE the RAN illustrated in can include transmission nodes such as the evolved universal terrestrial radio access E UTRAN or eUTRAN or UTRAN modules represented as the eNodeBs A and B. The eNodeBs can include both a macro node and a plurality of low power nodes as previously discussed.

The RAN can be in communication with an evolved packet core EPC . The EPC can include a serving gateway S GW and a mobility management entity MME . The EPC can also include a packet data network PDN gateway P GW to couple the S GW to a PDN such as the Internet an intra net or other similar network. The S GW can provide internet network access and standard network access for the mobile devices associated with the RAN. The S GW and MME can be in direct communication with each other via cabling wire optical fiber and or transmission hardware such a router or repeater.

The eNodeBs A B can be connected to one or more UEs such as UEs A B via an LTE radio link A B respectively. A backhaul link such as an X2 link can be used to connect the eNBs. The X2 link is typically formed over a broadband wired or optical connection between the eNBs. Connections between the eNBs A B the S GW and the MME can be made via S1 type connections A B and A B. The S1 interface is described in 3GPP Technical Specification TS 36.410 versions 8 2008 Dec. 11 9 2009 Dec. 10 and 10 2011 03 23 which are available to the public.

The EPC can also include a policy and charging rules function PCRF node that can be used to determine in near real time policy rules in the wireless network. The PCRF node can access subscriber databases and other specialized functions such as charging systems as can be appreciated.

In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention in order to avoid frequent handover procedures in a HetNet deployment scenario as illustrated in a new handover procedure is disclosed. In the new handover procedure a UE may maintain a connection with a macro eNB while moving between LPNs within the macro node s coverage area. Each LPN can be referred to as a transmission point reception point. As a UE moves from one transmission point reception point i.e. an eNB such as an LPN to another transmission point reception point the UE can maintain radio resources that are configured at the UE side with the macro node. This allows the UE to move from macro cell to pico cell or vice versa without tearing down and rebuilding radio resources such as a radio resource control RRC connection with the macro node.

In one embodiment the macro node and pico cell may be within wireless communication range such as a pico cell used for offloading. Alternatively the pico cell may be outside the range of the macro node such as a pico cell used to provide additional coverage. Whether the pico cell is inside or outside the wireless communication range of the macro node the pico cell and macro node may be connected via a wired or optical connection to form an X2 interface. In addition when the pico cell is within the wireless communication range of the macro node the pico cell and macro node may communicate via an air interface as can be appreciated.

When a UE moves from the coverage area of a macro node into the coverage area of a pico cell the UE may not be able to receive a downlink signal from the macro node due to interference from a downlink signal from the pico cell. In order for a UE to maintain a connection with a wireless network the UE is typically configured to be handed over from the macro node to the pico cell. This process is referred to as handover HO .

During handover most of the physical channels are reconfigured because physical channels are typically defined relative to the node to which they are connected i.e. macro node or LPN . Each node can also be referred to as a cell. The relationship of the physical channels with respect to the cell is referred to as being defined in a cell specific manner based on a physical cell ID of the cell.

For example the scrambling sequence for a UE can be initialized based on physical cell ID. When the UE communicates with a macro cell the physical channels are scrambled by the cell ID of the macro cell. When the UE communicates with a pico cell the physical channels are configured to be scrambled by a cell ID of the pico cell. To overcome this limitation cell specific parameters can be replaced with UE specific parameters. UE specific parameters can include a channel state information reference signal CSI RS and a demodulation reference signal DMRS .

For instance the scrambling sequence of a CSI RS or a DMRS of a Physical Downlink Shared Channel PDSCH or an Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel E PDCCH can be initialized with an RRC configured parameter instead of a cell ID of a specific node or cell. To derive a base sequence and cyclic shift hopping initialization for a Physical Uplink Shared Channel PUSCH a Physical Uplink Control Channel PUCCH or Sounding Reference Signal SRS an RRC configured UE specific parameter can be used instead of a physical cell ID of a specific node. For example a virtual cell identity can be configured for the PUSCH PUCCH or SRS. The same virtual cell identity can be applied for all uplink channels or a different virtual cell identity can be applied for each channel. Furthermore for the cyclic shift hopping initialization a dedicated cyclic shift hopping identity can be signaled and can be used instead of a physical cell identity.

Once all physical channels are not tied to a cell specific parameter the UE does not need to perform radio resource reconfiguration when a handover occurs even when the transmission point has changed from one cell to another cell. The UE can continue to use the radio resource configured by the macro cell. In other words the UE can continue to transmit and receive signals via downlink and uplink channels configured by the macro cell.

If a cell specific reference signal CRS to resource element RE mapping is different between a macro cell and a pico cell the simple indication of a transmission point TP change may be used to inform the UE of the change. A transmission point is a cell configured to transmit a signal. Similarly a reception point RP is a cell configured to receive a signal. The TP and RP are typically in the same cell. However it is possible for the TP and RP to be located in different cells. In this case the UE may need to know that a change in transmission point has occurred to apply a rate matching of PDSCH data around CRS resource elements REs . Otherwise a change in TP can be transparent to the UE.

For example from the UE s perspective the current serving macro node with which the UE is in communication referred to herein as the anchor serving cell can continue to be the serving cell regardless of a change in TP. In one embodiment the anchor serving cell of the UE does not change even when the UE moves out of the coverage area of the anchor serving cell.

In accordance with one embodiment an anchor serving cell such as a macro cell can be configured to determine whether a TP change is needed based on one or a combination of measurement reporting. The anchor serving cell can indicate to the UE the type of measurements are desired and send a measurement control message to a UE. In this period the UE can still communicate packet data to the anchor serving cell. The anchor serving cell can then forward the packet data to the serving gateway as illustrated in .

One measurement can include a CRS based Radio Resource Management RRM measurement which can be performed as described in the 3GPP LTE Rel. 8 specification describing RRM measurements. The anchor serving cell can configure the UE to measure neighboring cells including a target cell. A target cell as used herein is a macro node or LPN associated with a coverage area in which the UE is located in or is moving towards. As the UE moves towards the target cell power based measurements will increase while power based measurements made by the UE with respect to the anchor serving cell will decrease as occurs in a typical handover.

A CSI RS based RRM measurement can also be performed. For example the UE can measure CSI RS transmitted from each TP. In this case a new set of cells can be defined in order to let the UE know which CSI RS or CSI RS of which neighboring cell should be measured. Another measurement that can be performed includes CSI feedback in a physical uplink control channel PUCCH . The source cell such as the anchor serving cell can configure the UE to send CSI feedback of a set of CSI RS ports that are transmitted from the target cell or a set of neighbor cells. The CSI feedback can be UE specific instead of cell specific.

The UE can then send one or more measurement reports to the anchor serving cell after the UE is scheduled with an UL allocation. The report of the measurements may be communicated at a predetermined frequency communicated when a trigger is received from the serving cell or communicated when a reporting condition is met.

As the UE enters the coverage area of a non anchor cell referred to as a target TP a TP change decision can be implemented by the anchor serving cell. The anchor serving cell can transmit a TP change request to the target TP. In this request the anchor serving cell passes selected information to prepare for a TP change at the target TP. The selected information can include a UE specific identity used for physical channels. If the UE radio resource information for physical channels is already shared by possible cells for a TP change only the TP change indication may be transmitted to the target TP. The anchor serving cell can determine the possible cells of the TP change when it determines possible cells for CSI RS RRM measurement. A TP change request acknowledgement can then be sent from the target TP to the anchor serving cell.

After a TP change request acknowledgement message is received by the anchor serving cell a TP change indication message can be sent from the anchor serving cell to the UE. In one embodiment the TP change indication message can be communicated to the UE via at least one of Downlink Control Information DCI Medium Access Control MAC Control Element CE or RRC signaling.

When DCI is used to communicate the TP change indication message from the anchor serving cell to the UE the presence of a TP indicator can be configured by RRC signaling to include the TP indicator only when it is required. In this case either the anchor serving cell i.e. source TP or target TP can send TP or reception point RP change indicator depending on when the TP change is applied. For example if the TP is changed from the subframe when the indicator is received the TP change indicator is transmitted from the target TP. If the TP is changed after the TP change indicator is received the TP change indicator could be transmitted from the source TP.

When RRC signaling is used to communicate the TP change indication message from the anchor serving cell to the UE the TP change indication message can comprise an RRC connection reconfiguration message with a TP change indicator which can be signaled using RRC signaling. Since the exact activation time of reconfiguration with RRC signaling is not defined the timing of changing of a TP may be different depending on a UE RRC processing time. In one embodiment the UE RRC processing time can be taken into account when determining when to schedule a packet data transmission for the RRC connection reconfiguration message with the TP change indicator. The eNB can send the TP change indication message X subframes before TP is changed where X subframes is defined considering the UE RRC processing time and other factors e.g. HARQ processing time.

When a medium access control MAC control element CE is used to communicate the TP change indication message from the anchor serving cell to the UE a TP change indicator can be included in a MAC CE. In one embodiment a new MAC CE can be defined with a new Logical Channel IDentity LCID . Alternatively an activation deactivation MAC CE can be reused if it is not used for carrier aggregation.

After the TP has been changed packet data transmission and reception can occur between the UE and the target TP. In uplink communication the target TP can forward the received packet to the anchor serving cell which delivers the received packet to the serving gateway S GW . In downlink communication the anchor serving cell delivers buffered packets to the target TP and the target TP buffers packets from the anchor serving cell until the UE is prepared to receive the signal from the target TP. If the UE is ready to receive the signal from the target TP the target TP transmits it to the UE via an air interface.

After the TP has been changed the UE may need to perform updates with respect to PDSCH decoding uplink synchronization radio link monitoring and uplink power control downlink synchronization and the MIB SIB. The updates that may need to be performed will be discussed more fully in the proceeding paragraphs.

The UE typically performs PDSCH decoding based on the target TP information after the TP has been changed. For example the PDSCH or ePDCCH configuration is the same but CRS resource element RE position is changed with a new TP because the CRS is cell specific and the position may be different in each cell. Therefore REs available for PDSCH REs can be changed based on the CRS RE position of the new TP because the PDSCH or the ePDCCH are transmitted in the remaining REs which are not used for CRS. If the CRS is not transmitted in the serving cell such as in a new carrier type disclosed in the 3GPP LTE Rel 11 specification this operation is not required.

With regards to uplink synchronization the receiving point RP may be changed along with the TP. If the RP is changed the UE can be synchronized to the target RP. If the target RP already receives the uplink channels from the UE before the TP change happens then uplink synchronization may not required. For instance sending a time alignment command from the UE to the new RP may be sufficient to synchronize the UE with the RP for communicating data in the uplink. If the timing in the UL transmission from the UE to the new RP is off by an amount that is greater than the time alignment command can handle then the UE can be configured to send a physical random access channel PRACH preamble for uplink synchronization. Until the random access procedure is completed the UE can suspend the uplink transmission or the UE can transmit the uplink based on the timing of the serving cell. Alternatively the timing advance value can be signaled without sending the PRACH preamble if the anchor serving cell or target RP knows the proper timing advance value. One example scenario for this approach is that the cell size of the target TP is so small that zero timing advance value is required.

If radio link monitoring and uplink power control are based on the CRS of the anchor serving cell the UE is likely to experience a radio link failure and to use a high transmit power as specified by the 3GPP LTE specification Rel. 10. To avoid this problem the reference RS for radio link monitoring RLM and uplink power control can be changed to the CSI RS of the target TP. If the UE knows CRS information associated with the target TP the CRS of the target TP can be used for RLM and uplink power control.

With regards to downlink synchronization if the UE is located within a target TP s coverage it can be hard to receive CRS from the anchor serving cell due to interference. One possible problem is the poor CRS signal quality can degrade synchronization performance. When the TP changes the UE can also change the synchronization reference with CSI RS or CRS of the target TP.

If the RRC layer is still in the anchor serving cell the UE may still need to receive master information block MIB and system information block SIB information from the anchor serving cell only. In this case the UE can receive MIB SIB updated information with dedicated RRC signaling. In another embodiment if the RRC layer is moved to a non anchor cell of a target TP the UE can receive the MIB SIB information of the target TP. When the RRC layer is moved to the non anchor cell of the target TP then the UE can receive the MIB SIB information of the target TP directly or the target TP can send the MIB SIB information to the UE by using dedicated RRC signaling.

The anchor serving cell can be configured to typically connect the UE with the best DL and UL cell. In the TP change flow illustrated in it is assumed that the best downlink cell and the best uplink cell are located at the same cell. Therefore the TP and RP can typically be associated with the same cell. However it is also possible that a TP and an RP are associated with different cells. In this case the TP and RP changes are triggered to the different non anchor cells and the UE is signaled with a TP change and an RP change indication separately. The process however remains similar to the flow illustrated in and described in the preceding paragraphs as can be appreciated.

When a UE moves from a non anchor cell source TP to an anchor serving cell target TP to produce a TP change the process illustrated in in which the UE moves from an anchor serving cell to a non anchor cell can still be performed. However when moving from a non anchor cell to an anchor serving cell if an RRC layer connection of the UE is still in the anchor serving cell then the measurement control TP change decision can be made in the anchor serving cell. If the RRC layer connection of the UE is in the non anchor cell of the source TP the measurement control TP change can be performed by the non anchor cell of the source TP. When a TP change from the non anchor cell to the anchor serving cell occurs an existing U plane and C plane tunnel can be released after the TP change is completed. This will be discussed more fully in the proceeding paragraphs.

If the TP is changed the anchor serving cell can transmit a TP change request to a source TP. In the TP change request the anchor serving cell can indicate the target TP. The TP change request is then sent from the anchor serving cell to the source TP. The source TP then forwards the TP change request to the target TP. It is also possible for the anchor serving cell to send the TP change request to both the source TP and the target TP. Once the TP change request is sent to the source TP and the target TP the remaining TP change procedure is substantially the same as illustrated in and discussed in the preceding paragraphs.

In the flow illustrated in it is assumed that the RRC layer is located in the anchor serving cell. If the RRC layer is located in the source TP the measurement control TP change decision and TP change request can be made by the source TP.

In either of the flows illustrated in and the ability for a UE to move from one TP to another TP while maintaining an RRC connection can be applied when macro cells and small cells are deployed in the same frequency layer or when macro cells low power nodes are deployed in different frequency layers. In the latter case the TP change indication can be sent by the anchor eNB containing the source TP so that UE knows ahead of time when to switch the radio frequency signal to the frequency of the target TP. An implicit or explicit action time for the switch to the target TP after receiving the TP change indication from the source TP may be used.

Embodiments of this invention can also be applied when carrier aggregation is used. For example carrier aggregation may be used when a macro cell and a low power node both deploy carriers f and f. The primary serving cell Pcell of the UE corresponds to one of the carriers f or f of the anchor macro eNB. The secondary serving cell Scell of the UE corresponds to the other carrier of the anchor macro eNB.

Embodiments of this invention can also be applied when a macro cell and low power node both deploy carriers f and f while only the low power node deploys carrier f. In this embodiment the primary serving cell Pcell of the UE corresponds to one of the carriers f and f of the anchor macro eNB. The secondary serving cell Scell of the UE corresponds to the other of the carriers f and f of the low power node which can be designated as the TP of the UE.

In a typical 3GPP LTE system based on Rel. 8 9 or 10 when a handover is completed the S GW is configured to switch the downlink data paths to the target cell and releases data path to the serving cell. For example as shown in when the UE is located in the anchor source cell s coverage the UE is connected to the MME S GW through the source cell marked as flow . If the UE is handed over to the non anchor target cell the UE is connected to the MME S GW through the target cell marked as flow .

However in order to perform a TP change without terminating a connection between a UE and the MME SGW via the source eNB a new type of architecture may be used. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a connection of a UE to the anchor source eNB can be maintained even if the UE enters the coverage of the non anchor target eNB with its associated TP. The UE can be connected to the MME S GW through the anchor source eNB while the air resource connection of the UE is served by the non anchor target eNB as illustrated in by flow .

When an uplink connection is formed the non anchor target eNB forwards the received uplink data to the anchor source eNB via an X2 interface and the anchor source eNB delivers the data to the S GW. For downlink the anchor source eNB is configured to deliver data packet to the target TP via the X2 interface.

When a TP change request is sent from the anchor source eNB to the non anchor target eNB hosting the selected TP U plane tunnels can be established between the anchor serving cell and the target TP. One U plane tunnel for uplink data forwarding and another one for downlink data forwarding for each data radio bearer DRB . Unlike a typical handover procedure this U plane tunnel is used for the target TP to send the uplink data and used for the anchor serving cell to send the downlink data to the target TP after the TP changes. In addition a C plane tunnel is also established to forward C plane data for each signaling radio bearer SRB for uplink and for downlink separately between the anchor source eNB and the non anchor target eNB.

The device can further comprise a downlink data forwarding module configured to receive downlink information from the anchor serving cell that is sent from a core network CN . In one embodiment the core network can comprise an evolved packet core EPC that includes a mobile management entity MME and a serving gateway S GW .

The device can also include an air interface module configured to send the downlink information to the UE and receive uplink information from the UE via an air interface between the UE and the target cell. The device can also include an uplink forwarding module configured to send the uplink information to the anchor serving cell for communication to the CN to enable the UE to communicate with the CN via the target TP.

The HetNet handover device can further comprise a buffer module configured to buffer packets sent from the anchor serving cell to the target cell. The buffer module is an intermediate phase which typically occurs before the target TP sends downlink data to the UE.

In one embodiment the downlink data forwarding module is further configured to receive the downlink information from the anchor serving cell via an X2 interface . The downlink information can be sent from at least one of the mobile management entity MME and a serving gateway S GW to the anchor serving cell via an S1 connection .

In a first example embodiment illustrated in the anchor serving cell can be configured to host a packet data convergence protocol PDCP and an RRC layer. The control plane can include the RRC layer which can provide communication from a non access stratum NAS with the RRC communication carried by a signaling radio bearer SRB . A user data plane can communicate IP packets via a data radio bearer DRB in the anchor serving cell. The data can be compressed using ROHC and have security applied as illustrated in . To forward a PDCP protocol data unit PDU between the Anchor eNB containing the source TP and the non anchor eNB containing the target TP a tunnel is established for each radio bearer. For example an SRB tunnel and a DRB tunnel can be formed between the anchor serving cell and the target TP to carry the control data and user data respectively as PDCP PDUs in this example.

The target TP can include a radio link control RLC layer to receive the information via the SRB tunnel and DRB tunnel. A MAC and physical PHY layer can also be located in the target TP. Since security function is still in the anchor serving cell it is not necessary to change a security key and maintain encryption.

Another embodiment is illustrated in . In this example all Access Stratum AS protocols are located in the non anchor eNB containing the target TP. The S1 control and data paths are connected through the anchor eNB containing the source TP. To support it a control plane C plane tunnel and a user plane U plane tunnel are established for each radio bearer. Since the security function is located in the target TP the security key may need to be newly derived based on the target TP information as supported in handover. Alternatively the anchor serving cell can pass the security key related parameters to the target TP so that the target TP can simply use the serving cell parameters to derive the security key.

In another embodiment a different approach can be applied for DRB and for SRB. For instance for DRB approach may be applied while for SRB approach may be applied. Alternatively the opposite configuration is also possible with approach applied for SRB and approach applied for DRB.

In another example when the UE camps on the pico cell in the idle mode and thus an RRC connection is established with the pico cell in the connected mode for the actual call three example approaches are provided that can be used to avoid a frequent handover. In a first approach the pico cell can be designated as the anchor serving cell if the UE performs an RRC connection establishment with the pico cell. In this case a TP change as previously discussed can be applied with the pico cell operating as the anchor eNB.

In another approach a macro cell that the pico cell is overlaid on can always be designated as the anchor serving cell of the UE. When the UE performs an RRC connection establishment at a pico cell the pico cell can configure the radio resource configuration and security key related parameters of the UE that correspond to those of the anchor macro cell. The pico cell can request the macro cell to establish the connection to the MME S GW through the macro cell. When the macro cell establishes an S1 connection for this UE the macro cell can provide the radio resource configuration and security key related parameters for this UE. The C plane and U plane tunnels can be established between the anchor macro cell and the pico cell as illustrated in . Alternatively the UE can avoid camping on the pico cell during cell selection reception.

In a third approach after an RRC connection establishment the pico cell can be designated as the anchor serving cell of the UE. The pico cell can be configured to perform a pseudo handover of the UE to the macro cell. The macro cell then becomes the anchor serving cell. However the pico cell can remain as the source TP of the UE.

In another embodiment a method for performing a handover in a heterogeneous wireless network HetNet is disclosed as depicted in the flow chart of . The method includes the operation of receiving at an anchor serving cell in the HetNet channel measurement reports made by a user equipment UE for a plurality of cells as shown in block . The plurality of cells can include at least one macro cell and at least one low power node.

An additional operation of the method includes sending a transmission point TP change request that is based in part on the channel measurements for the UE from the anchor serving cell to a target transmission point wherein the target transmission point is located in one of the plurality of cells as shown in block . Information in addition to the channel measurement s can also be used to identify a transmission point that will be communicated in the TP change request. A further operation comprises sending a TP change indicator from the anchor serving cell to the UE to indicate a change in TP with which the UE will communicate via an air interface as shown in block .

The method further comprises receiving uplink packets from the UE at the anchor serving cell via the target TP. The uplink packets can be sent from the UE to the target TP via the air interface and forwarded from the target TP to the anchor serving cell. The downlink packets can then be sent from the anchor serving cell to the target TP for transmission to the UE via the air interface.

The operation of receiving channel measurements can further comprise receiving the channel measurements made by the UE using channel state information reference signals CSI RS to enable handover to occur for the UE from the anchor serving cell to the target TP while continuing to use a radio resource control RRC layer configured by the anchor serving cell.

The method can additionally include sending the TP change indicator from the anchor serving cell to the UE using one of downlink control information DCI radio resource control RRC signaling and a medium access control MAC control element CE and receiving radio link monitoring information and uplink power control information at the anchor serving cell based on channel state information CSI reference signals RS information measured in an air interface between the UE and the TP target.

The method can also include sending at least one of a master information block MIB and a system information block SIB from the anchor serving cell to the UE via the target TP. For example the MIB SIB information can be sent from an anchor cell via an X2 connection to the target TP. If the RRC layer is located in the target TP the UE can receive the target TP s MIB SIB from the target TP directly.

In one embodiment the UE can change from a source TP to a target TP by receiving at the anchor serving cell in the HetNet channel measurement reports made by the user equipment UE for the plurality of cells identifying that a change in TP is to be performed based on the channel measurement reports and sending a TP change request from the anchor serving cell to a source TP that indicates the target TP to enable the source TP to forward the TP change request to the target TP.

The method can additionally include forming an uplink downlink data path to the anchor serving cell by forming an s1 data connection between the anchor serving cell and at least one of a mobile management entity MME and a serving gateway S GW and forming an X2 interface between the anchor serving cell and the target TP to enable data communication between one of the MME and the S GW with the UE via the target TP wherein the target TP has a Uu connection with the UE.

The method also can include forming a U plane tunnel between the anchor serving cell and the target TP to enable uplink data forwarding and downlink data forwarding between the anchor serving cell and the target TP. A c plane tunnel can be formed between the anchor serving cell and the target TP to enable signaling radio bearer SRB communication for a downlink and an uplink between the anchor serving cell and the target cell.

In one embodiment the UE can be operable to perform a handover in a heterogeneous wireless network HetNet . The UE can have circuitry configured to receive a transmission point change indicator at the UE from an anchor serving cell indicating a target transmission point TP for an air interface with the UE sending uplink data from the UE to the target TP to enable the target TP to forward the uplink data to the anchor serving cell for communication to a core network and receiving downlink data at the UE from the target TP wherein the downlink data is sent from the core network to the TP via the anchor serving cell.

The circuitry of the UE can be further configured to receive the transmission point change indicator at the UE using one of downlink control information DCI radio resource control RRC signaling and a medium access control MAC control element CE identify carrier specific resource signal CRS resource element RE position for the target TP when CRS is transmitted by the target TP and perform physical downlink shared channel PDSCH decoding based on information in the CRS.

The circuitry of the UE may also be configured to send a physical random access channel PRACH preamble to the target TP to perform uplink synchronization with the target TP when the target TP includes a different receiving point RP than the anchor serving cell. The circuitry can also be configured to perform radio link monitoring and uplink power control using a channel state information reference signal CSI RS of the target TP and change a synchronization reference using the CSI RS of the target TP.

The UE can also have circuitry that is configured to send channel measurements made by the UE using channel state information reference signals CSI RS to enable handover to occur for the UE from the anchor serving cell to the target TP while continuing to use a radio resource control RRC layer configured by the anchor serving cell.
