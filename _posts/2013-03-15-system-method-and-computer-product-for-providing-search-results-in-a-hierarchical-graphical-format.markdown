Conventionally search interfaces are designed to search through large data sets and return data as a list of results with the most relevant results returned at the top of the list and less relevant results being returned at the bottom of the list. A user is typically presented with a text entry field through which a search query can be transmitted to a search engine which can be a web search engine such as GOOGLE YAHOO or BING a search mechanism for a particular website such as the search functionality on online shopping sites or systems for searching for data and metadata stored in a computer file system or a database. In response the search engine examines its index of resources and returns a subset of the index. Typically these interfaces do not provide for a great deal of user interaction related searches may sometimes be suggested but often related search terms are generated from data about popular search queries containing a word or phrase submitted to the search system. Typically these result data sets are generated from a larger data set created by a web crawler and the ranking of a particular site is determined by popularity and relevancy to a given term. Relevance is relative to the data set being searched. Algorithms for determining the relevance of data on the web may determine relevance to a query differently than algorithms for searching for content in a relational database an OLAP database a non relational database a file system or specialized data sources.

Commonly hierarchical classifications of data are found in various environments. For example the Dewey Decimal system used to classify works of literature is a very commonly used hierarchical classification system that breaks down works of literature into ten classes each of which can have any number of narrower subclasses and each subclass can be further narrowed. Another example can be found in a typical operating system file system for example NTFS FAT32 or HFS where folders and subfolders can be a hierarchical representation of where files may be located on a computer.

While hierarchical classifications are well known search algorithms often do not use hierarchical search algorithms because a substantial amount of data stored in various electronic formats is unstructured. Because so much data is unstructured and non hierarchical the use of visual representations to show hierarchical relationships is limited or nonexistent.

In one exemplary embodiment a computer implemented method of providing search results in an interactive hierarchical graphical format may be disclosed. A first query which may be formed from a user selection of one or more images may be provided to a system and transmitted to a search interface. On receipt of a data set of search results the data set can be transformed into a visual representation for display on a connected device. Related search categories can also be determined from a first query provided by a user and a visual representation of related search queries may also be displayed on a connected device. The method may further include forming additional queries based on user input and generating a visualization of a data set returned from transmitting an additional query to a search interface.

In another exemplary embodiment a system for providing search results in an interactive graphical user interface may be disclosed. A system may include an input device an output device a processing system and a transmission system. A processing system may be configured to receive input from a user and form a query based on user input. A transmission system connectively coupled to the processing system may transmit the query formed by the processing system to any of a plurality of search interfaces and receive a data set from at least one search interface. The processing system may transform a received data set into a set of machine readable instructions for displaying a visual representation of search results on the connected output device.

In a still further exemplary embodiment a system and method for generating hierarchies may be disclosed. A processing system may be connected to a plurality of search interfaces. The processing system may generate a hierarchy based on each of the plurality of search interfaces. Hierarchies can be generated from the structure of a database or computer file system specialized classification systems for specialized data sources general knowledge sources and other hierarchical classifications as appropriate for each of the plurality of connected data sources.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the spirit or the scope of the claims. Additionally well known elements of exemplary embodiments of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.

As used herein the word exemplary means serving as an example instance or illustration. The embodiments described herein are not limiting but rather are exemplary only. It should be understood that the described embodiments are not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Moreover the terms embodiments of the invention embodiments or invention do not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many of the embodiments described herein are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It should be recognized by those skilled in the art that the various sequences of actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs and or by program instructions executed by at least one processor. Additionally the sequence of actions described herein can be embodied entirely within any form of non transitory computer readable storage medium such that execution of the sequence of actions enables the at least one processor to perform the functionality described herein. Furthermore the sequence of actions described herein can be embodied in a combination of hardware and software.

In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiment may be described herein as for example a computer configured to perform the described action.

At transmission step the search query received at step may be transmitted to at least one search interface. In some embodiments transmission step may cause a search query to be transmitted to a search interface located on the same device for example transmission step may transmit a search query to a file system search interface a local relational database a local non relational database a local OLAP database or other appropriate search interface configured to conduct searches on a locally stored data source. In other embodiments transmission step may cause a search query to be transmitted to a remote search interface. For example a query may target information on the internet as a whole and transmission step may transmit a search query to an internet search engine. In another embodiment a query may target information on a particular website for example an online shopping site and transmission step may transmit a search query to that website s search interface.

Reception step may receive the results of a search from a search interface queried by transmission step . In some embodiments a result data set may include at least one search result at least one related search query or both at least one search result and at least one related search query. Reception step may be configured to receive search results in any machine readable format returned by the search interface.

Search result display step may receive the data set of search results from reception step and transform the raw data set into a machine readable visualization. This may be accomplished according to an exemplary method as shown in .

Relevance determination step may iterate through each of the one or more search results received from reception step and determine how relevant each of the one or more search results is. In some embodiments where a search interface may return a data set where each result comprises an n tuple of at least a description of the result and a relevancy score or rank relevance determination step may be omitted. In other embodiments relevance determination step may iterate through each of the one or more search results and generate a score embodying the relevance and closeness of each of the one or more search results to the original search query. In still further embodiments relevance determination step may iterate through each of the one or more search results and generate a ranking of each of the one or more search results. After scoring or ranking relevance determination step may further re order the data set of search results in any desired order for example relevance determination step may order the data set of search results such that the most relevant or highest ranked result is the first element of the data set in other embodiments the most relevant or highest ranked result may be in the exact middle of the data set or in any other appropriate position as known in the art. In an exemplary embodiment determinations of relevance and closeness can be made by determining the proportion of a transmitted search query that appears in a search result search results containing more of a transmitted search query may rank higher in relevance and closeness than search results containing less of a transmitted search query.

The data set generated by relevance determination step may then be used in size determination step . Size determination step may use the ranking or relevance score of each of the one or more results in the data set to determine the size of each search result. In some embodiments each of the one or more results in the data set can be assigned a different size in other embodiments the data set can be divided into any number of groups each of which may be assigned the same size. In an embodiment the results having the highest rank or relevance scores may be assigned the largest sizes and less relevant results can progressively be reduced in size.

Visualization instruction generation step may generate instructions for a connected device to display a visualization of the data set returned by a search interface and sized in step . If a tree map visualization is desired visualization instruction generation step may use a harmonious tiling algorithm where the visualization does not contain unused space in other embodiments visualization instruction generation step may use a non harmonious tiling algorithm where the visualization may contain unused space where the next entry in the data set would not fit in the dimensional constraints of the data set. Visualization instruction generation step may generate visualizations using tree map algorithms algorithms for generating branching and or radial maps or any other visualization as desired and known in the art.

Transmission step may transmit the instructions generated by visualization instruction generation step to a connected device. In some embodiments transmission step may transmit the visualization instructions over a network. The network may be a wireless local area network a wireless wide area network a wired network line of sight communication a wireless personal area network or any other communication network as desired and known in the art. In other embodiments transmission step may transmit the visual instructions to a visual processor on the same device. Transmission step may transmit a command to cause a connected device to perform display step to display the search result visualization on a connected device. In some embodiments only a portion of a visualization generated by visualization instruction generation step may be displayed to a user. Display step may be configured to update the portion of a visualization displayed to a user as a user scrolls through the search results.

Turning back to related search category display step may receive a data set of related search categories from step and display the related search categories on a connected device. Instructions to display a three dimensional shape with any number faces may be generated in some embodiments the number of faces may be determined by the number of related search categories returned by step . Each of the related search categories can be displayed on a face of a generated three dimensional shape. In some embodiments each related search category can be displayed as text in other embodiments each related search category can be displayed as an image each image comprising a face of a generated three dimensional shape. Instructions for creating the three dimensional shape can also contain instructions for allowing a user to interact with the three dimensional shape embodying the set of related search categories such that the three dimensional shape can be rotated in any direction and a selection of a face causes a search query related to the selected category to be created and executed. In some embodiments visualizations generated from a data set of related search categories returned by step may be displayed in addition to a pre determined visualization showing any number of potential search categories. These potential search categories may be high level concepts for example for a search interface directed to an online store the search categories generated for a search category visualization maybe information about various store departments e.g. home electronics etc. or brands.

In another exemplary embodiment as shown in a method may be a computer embodied method for providing search results of a user provided query and at least one related computer generated query in an interactive graphical user interface. Related query generation step may generate at least one query related to the first query which may be provided by a user or generated from a selection of a search result or a related search category. In some embodiments at least one related search query can be generated from a hierarchical classification of the first query. Related search queries may also be returned from a search interface generated from data about other searches performed by users who conducted a search using the first query or any other appropriate method as known in the art.

Each of the at least one related queries generated by related query generation step may be transmitted to a search interface in second transmission step which may be operatively similar to first transmission step . Second reception step may then receive each of the one or more search result data sets for each of the one or more related queries transmitted to a search interface in second transmission step . Both the first data set received in first reception step and each of the one or more second data sets received in second reception step may be transformed into a set of machine readable instructions for visualizing each of the search result data sets in display step as described above.

In some embodiments the first visualization generated from the first data set received in first reception step and each of the one or more second visualizations generated from each of the one or more second data sets received in second reception step may be visually distinguishable. Each of the search result visualizations may have a unique size when displayed on a connected device. Each of the search result visualizations may also have a unique color when displayed on a connected device. Still further each of the one or more search result visualizations may be distinguished by using different fonts different font styles or other visual differentiations as known in the art.

Within each of the one or more search result visualizations each search result may also be visually distinguishable. In some embodiments search results may be distinguishable by the size of each result in a visualization. In other embodiments each search result may be displayed in a different shade of a color family used for the search result visualization. A predetermined color palette may be defined for use in displaying each of the one or more search result visualizations. The color chosen for a search result visualization may be randomly selected or user defined.

In an exemplary embodiment as shown in method may be a computer embodied method for determining at least one related search result based on a first search query received from a user. Query category determination step may receive a search query and parse the search query to determine the general classification of data a user is requesting from the search query. The determined classification may be examined against at least one classification of data. In some embodiments classifications of data may be generated based on the data source a user desires to search dynamic generation of a hierarchy and classifications of data may be performed for example where the data source is large and unstructured. In other embodiments hierarchies and data classifications may be predefined and tailored to a specific data source. In some embodiments query category determination step may generate a determined classification based on the closest match in a determined hierarchical classification. Related search category determination step may determine at least one search category related to a first search query received from a user based on the query category determination made in step . In some embodiments related search category determination step may return at least one related search category. The at least one related search category may be a similar search category a narrower search category or a broader category encompassing the subject matter of the first search query as well as other information. Related search category display step may transform the at least one related search category into machine readable instructions for displaying said at least one related search category as a visual representation on a connected device.
