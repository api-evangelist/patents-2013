title: Optimization of polling protocols in sensor networks
abstract: A communication-management method involves a recurring polling scheme, wherein network nodes are polled by a base station according to optimized and/or user-preferred polling intervals assigned to each network node. The polling interval assigned to a given node may be optimized to minimize and/or achieve user-preferred thresholds for energy consumption and latency associated with each network node in the sensor network. Optimized and/or user-preferred polling intervals may be constrained in accordance with various network performance considerations, for example, a recommended update interval for each network node, characteristics of the network nodes themselves, the duration of the timeslots at which the network nodes are polled, and/or other network performance considerations.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 014 543 entitled Optimization of Polling Protocols in Sensor Networks filed Jan. 26 2011 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 299 687 entitled Minimizing Energy Consumption in Body Sensor Networks via Convex Optimization filed Jan. 29 2010 all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

This invention was made with U.S. government support under grant numbers W911NF 07 1 0287 and W911NF 05 1 0491 awarded by the Army Research Office. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

One emerging area of networked communications is the provisioning of sensor networks. Sensor networks enable the gathering of information throughout an environment and have applications for example in monitoring areas such as battlefields buildings or other geographical areas industrial processes such as machine conditions or fluid flow rates transportation systems such as traffic flow or traffic density and patient health such as any number of physiological conditions of a given patient . Many other applications exist as well.

Generally sensor networks consist of a set of network nodes or sensor nodes and a base station or controller with which the sensor nodes may communicate. The sensor nodes may be configured to monitor environment conditions in accordance with for example any of the applications mentioned herein. For example in an industrial processes application the sensor node may be configured to monitor an environment condition such as fluid flow rate at some point in an industrial process . As another example in a patient health application the sensor node may be configured to monitor an environment condition such as a physiological condition of a body .

A sensor network may assume any one or more of a variety of network topologies examples of which may include star ring bus tree fully connected cluster based mesh and or any other network topology now known or later developed. Further the topology of a given sensor network may change perhaps frequently.

Sensor networks may be wired or wireless. Among other benefits wireless sensor networks may generally be deployed with less cost effort and resources than wired sensor networks. Also wireless sensor networks are generally more flexible and robust and may therefore be put to use in more applications.

In a wireless sensor network the sensor nodes and base station typically communicate over an air interface according to an established communication protocol or an agreed method of managing communications in the wireless communication network. Examples of common communication protocols include CDMA e.g. EIA TIA IS 2000 Rel. 0 Rel. A or other versions thereof IS 2000 EIA TIA IS 856 Rel. 0 Rev. A or other versions thereof IS 856 etc. iDEN TDMA AMPS GSM GPRS UMTS EDGE WiMAX e.g. IEEE 802.16 LTE microwave satellite MMDS Wi Fi e.g. IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth infrared or any other communication protocol now known or later developed. A communication protocol may specify among other things data formats address formats switching and routing processes and flow control processes for network nodes operating under the communication protocol. A communication protocol used by a given sensor network may incorporate one of the common communication protocols delineated above or may incorporate a communication protocol that has been developed at least in part for sensor networks specifically.

Typical communication protocols employed by sensor networks may be broadly categorized into contention based protocols and polling based protocols. Contention based protocols generally allow for sensor nodes to communicate in a given sensor network without pre coordination. For example a contention based protocol may define the events that must occur when two or more sensor nodes attempt to simultaneously communicate on a given air interface and establish rules by which sensor nodes are given opportunities to communicate on the given air interface.

On the other hand polling based protocols generally involve a central network node such as a base station which periodically interrogates sensor nodes in a round robin recurring or other sequence to determine whether the sensor nodes have data to send to the base station. Polling based protocols therefore require some degree of pre coordination. The interrogation of a sensor node by the base station may take the form of a paging message sent over a paging channel of the air interface that serves to notify a sensor node that it is being paged.

The paging channel may be divided into a number of timeslots of equal length in which the base station may poll or page the sensor nodes. Each sensor node may be arranged to wake up and check the paging channel for a page with a given frequency. When paged the sensor node may respond or otherwise react in a manner specified by the particular polling protocol under which the sensor network is operating. As one example when paged the sensor node may transmit certain data to the base station.

Generally speaking the more often a sensor node is polled and transmits data the more quickly the sensor node will lose energy. Therefore in this respect it is desirable for a sensor node to check for pages and transmit data relatively infrequently. However there are competing considerations that make it desirable for a sensor node to check for pages and transmit data relatively frequently. For example it may be desirable for the sensor node to transmit data to the base station relatively frequently if the data collected by the sensor node e.g. as a result of monitoring an environment condition represents information that is time sensitive or otherwise important. If the sensor node transmits data relatively frequently the sensor node may transmit data with relatively low latency where latency is the amount of time between when the sensor node is ready to transmit data and when the sensor node actually does transmit the data. In this respect the lower the latency with which a sensor node transmits data the better the performance of the sensor node and therefore the sensor network will be.

Attempts to improve the energy efficiency of sensor networks have taken many forms including attempts to improve sensor transceiver design sensor network architecture and energy scavenging techniques. However wireless communication is also an important factor in energy consumption in sensor networks and therefore the development of efficient communication protocols or methods of managing communications for sensor networks is of particular interest.

Conserving the energy of sensor nodes while achieving a desired level of performance has proven to be a key challenge in sensor networks. A method of managing communications in a wireless sensor network that is designed to optimize and or achieve user preferred energy consumption and latency would be beneficial for many sensor network applications. Accordingly disclosed herein is such a communication management method. Various entities and systems that are configured to carry out aspects of the method are also disclosed.

The communication management method disclosed herein comprises a recurring polling scheme wherein network nodes are polled by a base station according to optimized and or user preferred polling intervals assigned to each network node. In some embodiments the polling interval assigned to a given node may be optimized based on a minimization of energy consumption and or latency associated with each network node in the sensor network. In other embodiments the polling interval assigned to a given node is based on user preferences regarding energy consumption and or latency thresholds associated with each network node in the sensor network. Thereby energy use and latency of the sensor network may be optimized and or operate according to user preferred thresholds. In addition polling intervals may be constrained in accordance with various network performance considerations for example a recommended update interval for each network node characteristics of the network nodes themselves the duration of the timeslots at which the network nodes are polled and or other network performance considerations.

In one aspect a base station assigns to at least one network node in a set of network nodes a respective polling interval based at least in part on a respective cost contribution of the at least one network node. During a timeslot selected according to the respective polling interval the base station then a polls the at least one network node and b as a result of the polling receives from the at least one network node one or more of network node data and environment data.

In another aspect prior to the assigning the base station or another entity may determine the cost contribution of the at least one network node based on one or more of an energy consumption metric associated with the at least one network node and a latency metric associated with the at least one network node. The determination of the cost contribution may be based on both i the respective cost contribution of the at least one sensor and ii a weighted average summation of a an energy consumption metric associated with each sensor in the set of sensors and b a latency metric associated with each sensor in the set of sensors. The determination may be further based on an optimization of a respective polling interval assigned to each sensor and or a user preferred threshold assigned to each sensor wherein the respective polling interval assigned to each sensor is assigned so as to not exceed for each sensor i each of a a recommended update interval b a buffer fill constraint and c an overhead constraint and ii a timeslot duration constraint.

In yet another aspect the base station may resolve a scheduling conflict resulting from selecting the same timeslot at which to poll a first network node and a second network node. Resolving the scheduling conflict therefore may comprise after the assigning the base station detecting that a same first time slot has been selected for both the first network node and the second network node. Responsive to the detecting the base station may select one of the first network node and the second network node based on a comparison between a priority metric of the first network node and a priority metric of the second network node. The base station may then poll the selected network node during the particular time slot.

These as well as other aspects and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings.

As described herein there are a number of different topologies that a given wireless communication network such as a wireless sensor network may assume. Accordingly and are simplified block diagrams of example sensor networks having respectively a star topology and a cluster based topology.

It should be understood that the arrangements described herein including the network topologies described with respect to and are set forth for purposes of example only. As such those skilled in the art will appreciate that other arrangements and other elements e.g. components interfaces functions orders of functions etc. can be used instead some elements may be added and or some elements may be omitted altogether. Further those skilled in the art will appreciate that many of the elements described herein are functional elements that may be implemented as discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components and in any suitable combination and location. Still further various functions described herein as being performed by one or more entities may be carried out by hardware firmware and or software. For instance various functions may be carried out by a processor executing a set of program instructions written in any suitable programming language e.g. C C Java etc. and stored in memory.

With reference to example sensor network comprises base station and set of network nodes . Base station may for instance be a controller of sensor network . Network nodes may for instance each be sensor nodes. That is network nodes may be arranged to measure at least one environment condition. Network nodes may also be arranged to transmit data for example data representing measurements of environment conditions to base station . Generally base station and network nodes may be arranged to carry out various respective sensor network functions described herein and may take on a variety of forms.

For example base station may be any wireless equipped base station access node access point or other network node capable of wireless communication with network nodes . As one example base station may be a wireless communications station installed at a fixed location and used to communicate as part of for example a wireless telephone system or a push to talk two way radio system. As another example base station may be a mobile device such as a cellular telephone personal digital assistant PDA laptop netbook tablet or any other wirelessly equipped device now known or later developed. As yet another example base station may be any suitable arrangement of hardware and software that is in whole or in part dedicated to controlling sensor network .

Generally base station may be a part of or may be communicatively coupled to a broader radio access network RAN which provides connectivity between one or more network nodes and one or more transport networks. For example base station may be communicatively coupled to a mobile switching center MSC that provides connectivity with a public switched telephone network PSTN which may connect with one or more remote entities such as a remote telephone device. As another example base station may be communicatively coupled to an MSC that provides connectivity with a packet data serving node PDSN which may connect with one or more remote entities such as a remote computer. According to such arrangements any of network nodes and or base station itself may be arranged to communicate with remote network entities.

Alternatively base station may not be communicatively coupled to any other network other than the network comprising itself and sensor networks e.g. sensor network as depicted .

As noted above there are a number of different topologies that sensor network may assume. As depicted in in some embodiments sensor network takes on a star topology. Such a star topology is generally characterized by a base station that can send and or receive wireless signals or messages directly from a number of remote network nodes. As shown in base station is in direct wireless communication with each network node in the set of network nodes .

In accordance with a typical star topology while network nodes can send and receive messages from base station network nodes generally do not send messages to one another. The star topology of sensor network may provide for relatively low latency communications between network nodes and base station . That is because network nodes are in direct communication with base station network nodes may be able to communicate with base station faster and more frequently than may be possible with other network topologies. However each of network nodes must be within the coverage area of base station if they are to be able to carry out communications with base station . Therefore the coverage area of sensor network may be limited by for example the transmit range of base station and or network nodes .

With reference to a second example sensor network comprises base station and set of network nodes . Base station and each network node in set of network nodes may take forms similar to base station and set of network nodes respectively as described above.

As depicted in in some embodiments sensor network takes on a cluster based topology. Similar to star topologies a cluster based topology may generally involve a base station that can send and or receive wireless signals or messages directly from a number of remote network nodes. However in cluster based topologies the network nodes are generally also allowed to communicate with one another.

As shown in base station is in direct wireless communication with network nodes . Network node is also in direct wireless communication with each of network nodes and and therefore network node may send and receive messages from network nodes and as well as base station . Thus network node may communicate with base station by sending a message to base station . Alternatively network node may communicate with base station by sending a message to either of network nodes or where the message indicates that it is intended for base station . Either of network nodes or may then relay the message to base station by sending the message to base station on behalf of network node .

Such an arrangement is typically referred to as a multihop communication and is typical of cluster based topologies. As depicted in multihop communications generally enable a network node to use an intermediate node to forward a message to a desired node such as base station . Intermediary network nodes that forward messages for other network nodes are often referred to as cluster head nodes. Either of network nodes and for example may be referred to as a cluster head node.

Multihop communications enable a network node that is out of communications range with another network node or a base station to communicate with that network node or base station by way of an intermediary node. For example with reference to network node is not in direct wireless communication with base station . Nonetheless network node is in direct wireless communication with network node . Therefore network node may communicate with base station by sending a message to network node that is then relayed by network node to base station on behalf of network node . As yet another example network node which is not in direct communication with base station may similarly communicate with base station by having either of network nodes or relay messages to base station on its behalf.

The cluster based topology of sensor network may be more redundant than other network topologies. For example if network node loses the ability to communicate directly with base station and network node network node may still be capable of communicating with base station via network node using multihop communication. Further the cluster based topology of sensor network may enable the sensor network to cover a larger area than may be possible with other network topologies. For example the coverage area of sensor network is generally not limited by the transmit range of base station or any individual network node in the set of network nodes . Instead the coverage area may be extended by for example simply adding more network nodes to the sensor network.

However in a cluster based topology network nodes that are not in direct communication with base station such as network nodes and may experience greater latency in communications with base station . That is because multihop arrangements require the relay of a message by an intermediary node network nodes that carry out multihop communications may do so more slowly and less frequently than network nodes in topologies comprising only direct communication arrangements. Further the energy consumed by sensor networks carrying out multihop communications will generally be greater than the energy consumed by sensor networks that do not.

Both the star topology of sensor network and the cluster based topology of sensor network are discussed further below with reference to an example polling method.

One or more steps of example method may be carried about by base station . Additionally one or more steps of example method may be carried out by an entity other than base station for example another base station another network entity or any other device arranged to carry out one or more steps of example method . In one example one or more steps of example method may be embodied as program instructions stored on a physical and or non transitory computer readable medium and executable by a processor. Such computer readable media may include magnetically or optically readable computer discs hard wired or preprogrammed chips e.g. EEPROM semiconductor chips nanotechnology memory or other data storage media. Alternatively instructions data structures and message structures related to the communication management system may be transmitted over the Internet or other networks including wireless networks via a propagated signal on a propagation medium e.g. electromagnetic wave s sound wave s etc. . For purposes of explanation aspects of method are described below as being carried out by base station . However such an explanation should not be taken to be limiting.

Generally sensor network may operate in a time synchronized manner wherein time is slotted into a number of timeslots of uniform length. Time may be slotted into a number of timeslots of non uniform length as well. With reference to polling timing diagram depicts a number of timeslots of uniform length timeslots T T of units of length T. Generally therefore each of timeslots T T are of the same duration or the same length of time T. While six complete timeslots are depicted in those of skill in the art will appreciate that time before and after T T may be slotted into similar additional timeslots. For example time before timeslot T may be slotted as depicted by timeslot T which extends into the past relative to T. Additionally time after timeslot T may be slotted as depicted by timeslot T which extends into the future relative to T.

Each of timeslots T T may be subdivided into two or more subslots. In some embodiments timeslots T T are subdivided into data transfer DT and alarm AL subslots. For example timeslot T is depicted as subdivided into subslots DT and AL while timeslot T is subdivided into subslots DT and AL.

Generally base station may poll a particular network node such as network node at a particular timeslot such as timeslot T. When polled network node may responsively transmit a data message to base station during data transfer subslot DT. During alarm subslot AL and any other AL subslot any of network nodes may transmit an alarm message to base station . In this way a network node may alert base station of for example a critical condition without waiting to be polled during a particular timeslot.

With reference again to method begins at step with base station assigning to at least one network node in set of network nodes for example network node a respective polling interval based at least in part on a respective cost contribution of network node . Then at step base station polls network node . Then at step base station receives from network node one or more of network node data and environment data. Each of steps and may be carried out during a particular timeslot selected by base station according to the respective polling interval assigned to network node . Each of steps are described in more detail below.

One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the method depicted by may be altered in a variety of ways. For example the order of the steps may be rearranged steps may be performed in parallel steps may be omitted and or other steps may be included.

Example method begins at step where base station assigns at least one network node from set of network nodes for example network node a respective polling interval based at least in part on a respective cost contribution of network node . That is base station may assign a polling interval to one multiple or every network node in set of network nodes .

With reference to polling interval timing diagram depicts a first polling interval and a second polling interval . First polling interval may be assigned to a first network node for example network node and second polling interval may be assigned to a second network node for example network node . Polling intervals and are examples only and other polling intervals may be used. Further while the assignment of only two particular polling intervals to two respective network nodes is explicitly discussed with respect to polling intervals may be assigned to any number of network nodes including one multiple or every network node in set of network nodes .

Example polling interval has a duration of 2 T or a duration equal to two timeslots. On the other hand example polling interval has a duration of 3 T or a duration equal to three timeslots. Other polling intervals may be used as well. Other polling intervals may include other integer multiples of time T for example 5 T or 10 T. Additional polling intervals may be non integer multiples of T for example 2.4 T or 2.9 T. As will be discussed below an optimized and or user preferred polling interval for assignment to network nodes may have been determined before step so as to optimize and or achieve user preferred energy used and latency experienced by the network nodes in sensor network . Polling intervals may be assigned according to other considerations as well.

At step base station polls network node during a timeslot selected by base station according to the respective polling interval assigned to network node at step . For example base station may poll network node during a timeslot such as timeslot T. On the other hand base station may poll network node during a different timeslot such as timeslot T.

Before polling the at least one network node during a particular timeslot however base station may select the particular timeslot according to the respective polling interval assigned to the at least one network node. Selection of a timeslot for polling a given network node based on the polling interval assigned to that network node may be done in a variety of ways. If a particular polling interval is an integer multiple of T base station may simply select timeslots that directly correspond to the duration of the assigned polling interval. For example base station may select timeslot T for polling network node because network node has been assigned polling interval equal to 2 T. Base station may then select subsequent timeslots at which to poll network node according also to polling interval equal to 2 T. More particularly as depicted in polling timing diagram base station may select timeslots T T and T at which to poll network node as indicated by polling call outs and and corresponding forward slash shading respectively. Base station may select future timeslots not shown as well such as T T and so on at which to poll network node .

As another example base station may select timeslot T for polling network node because network node has been assigned polling interval equal to 3 T. Base station may then select subsequent timeslots at which to poll network node according also to polling interval equal to 3 T. More particularly as depicted in polling timing diagram base station may select timeslots T and T at which to poll network node as indicated by polling call outs and and corresponding back slash shading respectively. Base station may select future timeslots not shown as well such as T and T and so on at which to poll network node .

If however the polling interval assigned to a particular network node is a non integer multiple of T base station may select a timeslot for polling the particular network node based on an approximation of the assigned polling interval. For example base station may approximate the polling interval by rounding the polling interval either up or down to the next integer multiple of T. Base station may then select the timeslot according to the approximated polling interval.

For example where a network node has been assigned a polling interval of 2.4 T base station may select timeslot T according to an approximated polling interval of 2 T after rounding the polling interval down to 2 T. As another example where a network node has been assigned a polling interval of 2.9 T base station may select timeslot T according to an approximated polling interval of 3 T after rounding the polling interval up to 3 T.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that other approximations of polling intervals may be used. As one example base station may simply drop any decimal remainder from a non integer polling interval such that polling intervals 2.4 T and 2.9 T would each be approximated as 2 T. As another example base station may simply take as the approximated polling interval for a non integer polling interval the next highest integer number such that polling intervals 2.4 T and 2.9 T would each be approximated as 3 T. As yet another example base station may randomly choose as the approximated polling interval for a non integer polling interval either the next highest or the next lowest integer.

Once base station has selected a timeslot according to the respective polling interval base station then polls the network node during the timeslot. In some embodiments base station sends a polling message to the network node at the beginning of the particular timeslot which the network node may interpret as an indication that the network node may communicate with base station during that timeslot. As noted above the particular manner in which base station polls a given network node and the particular manner in which the given network node responsively transmits data to base station may take any one of a variety of forms now known or later developed. For instance base station may send the network node a polling message in the form of a paging message and the network node may be arranged to responsively transmit data to the base station during a data transfer subslot of the timeslot.

For example with reference to polling timing diagram base station may poll network node at the start of timeslot T and during subslot DT network node may responsively transmit data to base station . As another example base station may poll network node at the start of timeslot T and during subslot DT network node may transmit data to base station .

At step base station receives from network node the data transmitted by network node during the selected timeslot. The data may generally be any data that network node is arranged to store collect generate or otherwise maintain for transmission to base station . Generally network node may be arranged to transmit data in accordance with the particular application of sensor network .

The data transmitted by network node may take the form of either network node data and or environment data. It should be understood that the characterizations of data as either network node data and or environment data is for purposes of explanation only and should not be interpreted as limiting. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the data transmitted by network node may take any number of different forms and may correspond to any number of different types of information.

In some embodiments network node data represents various types of static information that does not vary with time. For example network node data may include information pertaining to static features of the network node including various sensor hardware parameters. One such static feature may be a buffer size B of the network node that indicates an amount of data that the network node is capable of storing for example a number of bits bytes or other indication of storage space. Another static feature may be a measurement size or length M of measurements that the network node is configured to make for example a number of bits bytes or other indication of measurement size. The measurement size M may generally indicate an amount of data generated by the network node per unit time. Yet another static feature may be a measurement frequency SF at which the network node is configured to take measurements for example a number of measurements per second or other suitable time period.

Yet another static feature still may be a relative rank RR of the network node. For example the relative rank RR may indicate a relative priority of the network node with respect to other network nodes in the sensor networks. The relative rank RR may be assigned to the network node according to for example the relative importance of the network node to the overall performance of the sensor network. For example if a given network node is configured to monitor a critical environmental condition the network node may be assigned a relatively high relative rank RR. On the other hand if a given network node is configured to monitor an unimportant environmental condition the network node may be assigned a relatively low relative rank RR.

As described above network node is configured to transmit network node data to base station . However because network node data does not generally vary with time base station may also be configured to store such network node data without it having been transmitted or retransmitted to base station by a network node. That is base station may store in data storage network node data corresponding to one multiple or each network node in sensor network . This network node data may be received from the network sensors a manufacturer or other third party and or another data source. As discussed further below base station may use such network node data for purposes of optimizing and or determining user preferred thresholds for the polling intervals assigned to network nodes in sensor network .

In some embodiments data transmitted by network node alternatively or additionally takes the form of environment data. Generally environment data represents various types of dynamic information that may vary with time. For example environment data may include information pertaining to environment conditions that sensor network monitors. Environment data may take the form of an indicator function I AD which in some embodiments takes a value of 1 or 0. For example if a network node has measured an environmental condition that is outside of a standard range the network node may set an indicator function associated with that environmental condition equal to 1. In this way the network node may provide an indication that some environment condition is out of the ordinary. Otherwise the network node may leave the indicator function equal to a default value of 0.

As another example environment data may include information pertaining to an environment condition measured by the network node. Such an environment condition may be a temperature fluid flow rate altitude speed or any other condition that the network node is configured to measure. Such examples of environment conditions are provided for purposes of example only and should not be taken to be limiting. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that many other environment conditions may be captured as well.

At step prior to assigning a respective polling interval base station or some other entity or combination of entities may determine the cost contribution of network node . In some embodiments the cost contribution of various network nodes is determined for the purpose of assigning optimized and or user preferred polling intervals to the various network nodes. In other words a cost contribution may be determined for each network node in the set of network nodes wherein the polling interval assigned to each network node is optimized so as to minimize the total cost of sensor network set according to one or more user preferred thresholds and or otherwise achieves a desirable result. Generally the cost contribution of a given network node may be determined based on a variety of different cost metrics depending on those characteristics of sensor network that are to be optimized or set according to a user preferred threshold. Thus as used herein the term cost is a descriptive term representing for example the amount of a given metric such as energy or latency used or experienced by a network node or sensor network .

For purposes of minimizing the total energy consumption and or achieving a user preferred energy consumption of sensor network the cost determination may be based on at least an energy consumption metric associated with network node . As another example for purposes of minimizing the average latency of network nodes and or achieving a user preferred average latency of network nodes in sensor network the cost determination may be based on at least a latency metric associated with network node . Of course for purposes of minimizing and or achieving a user preferred value for both the total energy consumption of sensor network and the average latency of network nodes in sensor network the cost determination may be based on both an energy consumption metric and a latency metric. Further the cost determination may also be based on cost metrics associated with multiple or all of network nodes . Those of skill in the art will appreciate that other characteristics may be minimized or set according to a user preferred threshold and correspondingly that the cost determination may be based on other metrics as well.

Generally determination of the optimum and or user preferred polling interval for each network node may involve a consideration of tradeoffs between the cost metrics of interest. For example while energy consumed by a particular network node may be desirably reduced by increasing the duration of the polling interval assigned to that network node increasing the duration of the polling interval may also undesirably increase the latency experienced by the network node. Further depending on the environment conditions monitored by a given network node it may be undesirable for the network node to be assigned a polling interval that is longer than a given duration. That is it may be necessary to receive data updates from a given network node at time intervals that are less than a maximum time interval.

Described generally herein therefore is a technique for minimizing the cost contribution and or achieving a user preferred cost contribution of sensor nodes in a sensor network and for minimizing the total cost and or achieving a user preferred total cost of the sensor network itself. Aspects of the technique described below may be carried out at step by various functional entities described herein such as base station another network node or another suitable functional entity. Further aspects of the technique described below involve the specification of certain parameters or constraints. Specification of such parameters or constraints may be done as part of the design of a particular sensor network for example by a network engineer or other individual involved with the specification of the sensor network. On the other hand such parameters or constraints may be inherent properties of the sensor network itself such as features of the particular sensor nodes in the sensor network.

The particular technique described below is set forth for purposes of explanation. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that modifications to and variations on certain aspects of the technique described below may be used.

Assume that a given sensor network comprises N sensors S . . . S . . . S. Generally each sensor is arranged to monitor at least one environment condition. The transmission rate used by the base station and all the sensors is DR bits per second bps . Each sensor Shas a buffer of size Bbits and collects measurement samples of length Mbits at a frequency of SFHz.

Based on the importance of the environment condition being monitored each sensor is assigned a relative rank RRbetween 1 to N such that RR RRfor i j. That is no two sensors are assigned the same relative rank. In the context of a body sensor network for example an electrocardiogram ECG sensor may be ranked with a higher relative rank than a temperature sensor.

The transmission rate DR buffer size B measurement size M and measurement frequency SF are parameters that do not change with time. In other words these parameters are static features of a particular sensor S.

Further each sensor Sis associated with several time varying parameters including detection of out of range environment conditions which may be represented as an indicator function I AD which in some embodiments is 1 if the sensor has recorded Abnormal Data i.e. out of range environment conditions and 0 otherwise. Other time varying parameters include RB t which indicates Remaining Buffer space at time t RB t which indicates Remaining Buffer space at time t and RE t which indicates remaining energy at time t. Each sensor network is polled by the base station in accordance with a polling interval T.

Within this framework optimization and or achievement of user preferred threshold of the energy used by and the latency experienced by the sensors in the sensor network generally involves a identifying certain constraints placed on the performance of the sensors and sensor networks b identifying a cost function for each sensor c identifying a latency function for each sensor and d optimizing and or achieving a user preferred threshold for a total cost function of the sensor network based on the cost function and latency function of each network node in the sensor network that is to be polled. The technique generally involves optimizing and or achieving a user preferred threshold for the polling interval Tof each sensor such that the total cost function of the sensor network is minimized or satisfies a user preferred threshold.

Depending on the sensor network and the particular application of the sensor network an upper bound on the polling interval Tmay be specified for each sensor S. Thus for a polling interval Tassigned to sensor S 0 T T for i 1 2 . . . N 1 

Since each sensor Scollects measurements of length Mat a frequency SF the data collected in the polling interval Tis given by SF M T. Between transmissions of data a sensor must only be allowed to fill a fraction xof its buffer because otherwise a buffer overflow would result. Hence the amount of data held in a sensor s buffer at any given time does not exceed x B. Further there is an overhead Ov of additional bits representing overhead information such as for example pilot and sync security error correction and or control information. Thus each update consists of SF M T Ov bits. In some embodiments in order to ensure that old data i.e. data collected during a prior polling interval does not accumulate in the buffer all the data collected by a sensor Sduring a particular polling interval Tis transmitted to the base station during the next timeslot at which the sensor Sis polled. Given the transmission rate as DR and the length of data update subslot as DT the total data that can be transferred by a sensor Sduring a given data update subslot is DT DR bits imposing the following constraint on the respective polling interval Tof each sensor Sin the sensor network 

Additionally each timeslot is of length T which gives 1 T slots in a unit time interval. Since each sensor occupies 1 Tslots in this interval and each timeslot can be assigned to at most one sensor the following constraint may also be imposed 

As noted above the energy cost of a given sensor and therefore the overall energy cost of the sensor network may be determined based on an energy consumption metric associated with each sensor. The energy consumption metric may be represented by an energy cost function.

Each sensor Ssends SF M T Ov bits in each date update subslot of the timeslot during which the sensor Spolled. The duration of this transmission is therefore given by SF M T Ov DR. If the power consumption of the sensor radio in the sensor in transmit mode is Ptx the energy consumption for this transmission is given by Ptx SF M T Ov DR. Since a sensor Sperforms 1 Tupdates in a unit time interval the energy consumption in that unit time interval is 

where the term Erepresents the minimum energy required to transmit the data and Ei T is an overhead energy. Since Eis independent of T generally only Ei T is relevant as an energy consideration when optimizing the energy cost for each sensor.

The importance of energy consumption could be unequal for different sensors and therefore the total energy function E for the sensor network is a weighted sum of the variable energy consumption or Ei T for each sensor. Thus 

where is the relative weight assigned to energy consumed by sensor S with 0 1. In general a sensor that is more energy constrained may be assigned a higher value of .

Thus the energy consumption metric associated with each sensor may generally be described by an energy cost function comprising a ratio of i a product of a power consumption of a sensor radio of the at least one sensor and a number of overhead bits transmitted by the at least one sensor and ii a product of a data rate of transmission of the at least one sensor and a polling interval of the at least one sensor. Further the total energy cost function of the sensor network may generally be described as a weighted summation of each energy cost function associated with each sensor in the sensor network.

As noted above the latency cost of a given sensor and therefore the overall latency cost of the sensor network may be determined based on a latency metric associated with each sensor. The latency metric may be represented by a latency cost function.

The latency is defined as the time interval between the collection of data during a given measurement by a sensor and transmission of that data to the base station. Generally each sensor collects measurement samples at a constant rate and transmits the data corresponding to those measurements to the base station approximately once every polling interval T. The precise amount of time between data transmissions may depend on the particular timeslot assigned to a sensor for a given transmission of data.

Since generally the duration of the data update subslot of a given timeslot is much less than the polling interval T the average latency for a given measurement is approximately given in the present optimization technique as L T 2.

Therefore the total latency function L for the sensor network is a weighted sum of the average latency for each sensor. Thus 

where is the weight assigned to sensor S with 0 1. Generally a higher value of indicates a higher priority of minimizing the latency of sensor .

Thus the latency metric associated with each sensor may generally be described by a latency function comprising an average latency. The total latency function of the sensor network may generally be described as a weighted summation of each latency function associated with each sensor in the sensor network.

In some embodiments the overall cost function of the sensor network may be defined according to a sum of the total energy contribution function E and the total latency function L. Generally the energy contribution function E and the latency function L may be weighted according to an energy latency factor . In practice may reflect the importance given to latency considerations relative to energy consumption considerations in a given sensor network or a given sensor network application. For example if latency is not considered important at all in a particular application may be set to zero to achieve minimum energy consumption in the sensor network. On the other hand of course if latency is considered very important in a particular application may be set to one so as to achieve full consideration of latency with respect to energy consumption.

Thus the total cost of the sensor network may generally be described by a total cost function comprising a weighted average summation of a an energy consumption metric associated with each sensor in the set of sensors and b a latency metric associated with each sensor in the set of sensors.

By combining equations 1 2 and 3 with the overall cost function 7 the total cost of the sensor network may be optimized according to 

Thus the total cost of the sensor network may generally be optimized by minimizing ii a weighted average summation of a an energy consumption metric associated with each sensor in the set of sensors and b a latency metric associated with each sensor in the set of sensors. The technique may be further based on an optimization of a respective polling interval and or achievement of a user preferred respective polling interval assigned to each sensor and wherein the respective polling interval assigned to each sensor is assigned so as to not exceed for each sensor i each of a a recommended update interval b a buffer fill constraint and c an overhead constraint and ii a timeslot duration constraint. Minimizing the total cost and or achieving a user preferred total cost of the sensor network in this way results in the determination of an optimum and or user preferred polling interval T for each sensor in the sensor network.

Equation 10 reflects sensor S s share of the total cost of the sensor network and in this sense provides an indication of the relative importance of sensor S. In general this cost may be lower for sensors that monitor parameters of high importance. The utility of each sensor may be defined as the negative of this cost. Thus minimizing energy and latency and determining optimized and or user preferred polling intervals is based at least in this sense on the cost contribution of each network node in the network.

Those of skill in the art will understand that in some embodiments aspects of the technique described herein may take the form of a convex optimization problem. That is by noting a tradeoff between energy consumption and latency the technique formulates a convex cost function used to optimize corresponding energy consumption and latency metrics. The convex optimization problem is solved by determining optimum polling intervals for each sensor in the sensor network and thereby achieving a minimum total cost of the sensor network. In other words the convex optimization problem has a polynomial time solution that provides optimal performance in terms of energy consumption and latency.

Generally the optimal and or user preferred polling interval Tassigned to each network node based on the cost contribution calculation will be assigned such that no two network nodes will be assigned the same polling interval.

However due to the recurrent nature of the polling scheme in some embodiments it is possible that base station may select the same timeslot for polling two or more network nodes. For example recall with reference to that polling timing diagram depicts base station selecting timeslots T T and T for polling network node in accordance with an assigned polling interval equal to 2 T. Polling timing diagram also depicts base station selecting time slots T and T for polling network node in accordance with an assigned polling interval equal to 3 T. Thus in the example depicted by base station selects timeslot T for polling both network node and network node resulting in a scheduling conflict during timeslot T.

That is in polling arrangements it may be undesirable to poll or base station may not be capable of polling more than one network node during a single timeslot. For example base station may not be able to address a paging message to more than one network node at a time. As another example base station may not be able to receive transmissions during a particular data update period such as data update period DT from more than one network node.

One approach to resolving such a scheduling conflict may involve simply selecting for polling at the timeslot during which the conflict occurs the network node that has a highest priority. For example if network node has a higher priority than network node base station may select the timeslot during which the conflict occurs to poll network node and then select a timeslot after which the conflict occurs to poll network node . However such an approach requires that the relative priority of the network nodes not change with time which may be undesirable.

According to embodiments of the technology instead base station may implement a temporal function that computes the relative priorities of the network nodes at the time of the conflict. As a result base station may be able to poll during the timeslot at which the scheduling conflict occurs the network node having the highest priority at that particular point in time.

Note that more than two sensors may initially be selected for polling during a particular timeslot. In such a case the timeslot during which the conflict occurs may be selected for the network node having the highest priority as determined by conflict resolution and then the conflict resolution may be repeated with the remaining network nodes until all network nodes are assigned to different timeslots.

Thus depicts a simplified conflict resolution flowchart in accordance with some embodiments. In general conflict resolution may involve comparing various respective priority metrics associated with a given network node with corresponding respective priority metrics associated with each conflicting network node. Some of the priority metrics may not vary with time. For example one priority metric may be a relative rank of the network node that may be pre determined as explained above. On the other hand some of the priority metrics may vary with time.

Generally the time varying priority metrics may comprise information provided to base station by the network node. One example of a time varying priority metric may include environment data such as an indicator function I AD which the network node may set to 1 active if it has measured an environmental condition that is outside of a normal range and may set to 0 if not. Another example of a time varying priority metric is a remaining buffer space RB t of the network node. Yet another example of time varying priority metric is a remaining energy RE t of the network node. Other time varying priority metrics may be used as well. For those priority metrics that vary with time base station may use the priority metric information last received from the network node for resolving scheduling conflicts with respect to that network node.

As depicted by conflict resolution flowchart a set of conflicting sensor nodes is first evaluated to determine whether any of the conflicting sensor nodes has an active indicator function at decision point . If more than one of the conflicting sensor nodes has an active indicator function that subset of the conflicting sensor nodes is evaluated to determine which sensor node in the subset of sensor nodes has a highest relative rank at decision point . At selection point the sensor node in the subset of sensor nodes that has the highest relative rank is then selected for polling at the conflict timeslot.

If a single sensor node in the set of conflicting sensor nodes has an active indicator function that sensor node is selected for polling at the conflict timeslot at selection point .

If no sensor node in the set of conflicting sensor nodes has an active indicator function set of conflicting sensor nodes is then evaluated to determine which sensor node in the conflicting sensor nodes has the least remaining buffer space RB t at decision point . At selection point the sensor that has the least remaining buffer space RB t is then selected for polling at the conflict timeslot.

If at least two sensor nodes have the same or substantially the same remaining buffer space RB t that subset of sensor nodes is then evaluated to determine which sensor node in the subset of sensor nodes has the least remaining energy RE t . At selection point the sensor node in the subset of sensor nodes that has the least remaining buffer space RE t is then selected for polling at the conflict timeslot.

If at least two sensor nodes that are evaluated at decision point have the same or substantially the same remaining energy RE t that subset of sensor nodes is then evaluated to determine which sensor node in the subset of sensor nodes has the highest relative rank at decision point . At selection point the sensor node in the subset of sensor nodes that has the highest relative rank is then selected for polling at the conflict timeslot.

Thus in sum conflict resolution may comprise after base station assigns a polling interval to network node detecting that a same first time slot has been selected for both network node and network node . Base station may then responsive to the detecting select one of network node and network node based on a comparison between a priority metric of network node and a priority metric of network node . Base station may then poll network node during the particular time slot. Base station may then poll network node during a time slot after the timeslot at which it polls network node .

The approach to conflict resolution discussed above may be implemented in software hardware or any combination thereof. For example aspects of the conflict resolution may be carried out by base station or may be carried out by any other suitable entity arranged to carried out aspects of the conflict resolution. In another example aspects of the conflict resolution may be embodied as program instructions stored on a physical and or non transitory computer readable medium and executable by a processor.

While certain functions and aspects of the present technology have been described with respect to sensor network as depicted in certain functions and aspects of the present technology may be carried out in other sensor networks such as sensor network as depicted in . That is certain functions and aspects of the present technology may be carried out in a sensor network having a cluster based topology. Of course functions and aspects of the present technology may be carried out in sensor networks having other topologies as well.

Base station may poll network nodes in sensor network that are in direct communication with base station in a manner similar to that in which base station polls network nodes in sensor network as described above. However because the network nodes that are in direct communication with base station may also serve as relay nodes for network nodes that are not in direct communication with base station additional parameters may be considered when optimizing and or determining user preferred polling intervals for network nodes in cluster based topologies.

As one example network node may require a first timeslot to transmit its own data to base station and may require a second timeslot to transmit data on behalf of network node . Therefore the duration of the polling interval assigned to network node may be further constrained by the time required for the transmission of data on behalf of network node . In other words the duration of the polling interval may be constrained by the duration of a timeslot in addition to any other constraints such as a recommended update interval.

As another example network node may require energy to transmit its own data to base station and may require additional energy to transmit data on behalf of network node . Further network node will require energy to transmit its own data to network node . Even further network node will require additional energy to receive the data transmitted by network node . Therefore the energy consumption function of network nodes in a cluster based topology may incorporate additional energy considerations arising from the relay function performed by some network nodes in the sensor network.

As yet another example network node may require additional time to both transmit its own data and transmit data on behalf of network node . As noted above network node may require an additional data update period during an additional timeslot for the transmission of data received from network node . Therefore the latency function of network nodes in a cluster based topology may incorporate additional latency considerations arising from the relay function performed by some network nodes in the sensor network.

One application that may be particularly benefited by aspects of the sensor network functions described herein is a body sensor network. Body sensor networks BSNs generally enable continuous non intrusive and remote health monitoring of a given body. In general a body sensor network may include a base station or controller and multiple sensors. The base station or sensors may be for example worn carried or implanted internal to the body. In some embodiments the base station may take the form of a mobile device such as any of those mobile devices discussed above.

Generally sensors in a body sensor network may be severely energy constrained as a result of running off a small battery and or energy scavenging techniques. Minimizing energy consumption may therefore be beneficial in body sensor networks.

Further data received from sensors by the base station in a body sensor network may be particularly time sensitive. For example a particular sensor may be configured to monitor a vital environment condition such as a vital physiologic parameter. Physiological parameters that are monitored by a body sensor network may include among other physiological parameters temperature heart rate breathing rate blood pressure glucose levels or pulse. The provision of optimized and or user preferred polling intervals within a technique that allows for the specification of polling interval constraints is therefore beneficial in body sensor networks. For example a physician may specify a maximum polling interval for a given sensor node in accordance with physician requirements.

As another example wireless communication interface may be configured to communicatively couple base station to other network entities perhaps in other communication networks. To facilitate these couplings communication interface may take various forms. For example wireless communication interface may take the form of one or more antennas adapted to facilitate wireless communication according to a desired protocol and or any other interface that provides for wireless communication with an entity.

Some data storage mediums may be integrated in whole or in part with processor .

As another example program logic may be executable by processor to prior to the assigning determine the cost contribution of the at least one network node based on one or more of an energy consumption metric associated with the at least one network node and a latency metric associated with the at least one network node.
