Tunable inductors and in particular MEMS tunable inductors form an important component of both power and communication systems. Tunable inductors are used as a frequency control element in communication systems allowing communication networks to be used in different frequency bands. Variable inductors can be used to vary the resonant frequency of inductor capacitor LC tanks used in voltage controlled oscillators and other RF circuits and to control bandwidth and cut off frequency of tunable filters. In power systems tunable inductors can change the impedance of matching networks during operation allowing load matching for more efficient power delivery.

There have been previously known MEMS tunable inductors which utilize actuators such as electrostatic actuators to vary the inductance of the inductor. A survey of the forms of MEMS tunable inductors commonly used is given in M. M. Teymoori and J. M. Ahangarkolaei MEMS tunable inductors a survey Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences vol. 5 2011 pp. 1868 1878 herein incorporated by reference. To briefly summarize the largest tuning ratios are typically achieved using switch based techniques where the configuration of discrete inductors is changed by for instance adding additional inductors in series by closing MEMS switches. Although effective this technique only allows only a handful of specific inductance to be obtained continuous tuning is impossible without an infinite number of segments and switches. A number of approaches have been demonstrated for creating continuous tuning but typically with much smaller tuning ratios. These methods include changing the permeability of a magnetic material in the core by an additional bias field or physically changing the position of coils relative to each other to change the coupling between them. A magnetic core can also be selectively inserted or retracted into a coil to change the inductance. As discussed in the survey paper the best continuous tuning techniques available generally only can obtain a tuning ratio of 3 or 4.

The inductance of an inductor is dependent upon the strength and scale of the magnetic field that is created when electrical current passes through one or more inductors wound around the core. Consequently inductors with magnetic cores of high permeability such as iron containing alloys or ceramics are oftentimes used to increase the magnetic field response of the inductor. For a magnetic core inductor where the magnetic flux is contained within the core the inductance L is given by

As shown when the magnetic core fully links all of the inductor coils through a closed loop the inductance is directly proportional to the permeability of the core. For example common core materials such as iron containing alloys or ceramics have permeabilities in the hundreds or thousands while some exotic materials such as metglas exhibit permeability in the millions. However for high currents most magnetic materials begin to saturate thus reaching a maximum magnetic flux density above which the inductor behaves nonlinearly.

In order to prevent saturation of the magnetic core many magnetic cores include an air gap. With an air gap the inductance of the coil is dominated by the air gap when is large the inductance is approximately given by

The present invention provides a tunable inductor which overcomes all of the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known devices.

In brief the tunable inductor of the present invention comprises a magnetic core which includes an air gap. In order to vary the inductance of the inductor the inductor includes a tuner that is moveable relative to the magnetic core in the vicinity of the air gap. An actuator is attached to the tuner which upon actuation moves the tuner relative to the magnetic core to thereby vary the spacing between the tuner and the magnetic core in the vicinity of the air gap. The variation of the spacing between the tuner and the magnetic core varies the effective air gap of the overall inductor in the desired fashion.

With reference first to one embodiment of a tunable inductor in accordance with the present invention is shown. In this embodiment the tunable inductor is designed to be a microelectromechanical system MEMS device having components generally of the micrometer size. However the size of the tunable inductor should not be construed as limiting and in other embodiments the tunable inductor need not be a MEMS and or can have larger size components.

The MEMS tunable inductor may be formed on substrate . As shown the substrate may be generally planar. In addition it will be appreciated that the MEMS tunable inductor illustrated in is illustrated in a greatly magnified form for ease of explanation .

The MEMS tunable inductor includes a magnetic core . Here the magnetic core is generally C shaped having two ends defining an air gap . The air gap is essentially a void or separation between the ends of the C shaped magnetic core . The term air gap as used herein is believed to be consistent with the use of that term in the art. It does not require air or any other medium to be present in the void. For example the inductor might be present in a vacuum and still be considered to have an air gap. 

The magnetic core can be constructed of any conventional ferromagnetic material such as permalloy and can be formed on the substrate utilizing any conventional manufacturing technique such as depositing the ferromagnetic material onto the substrate . Furthermore although the magnetic core is illustrated in as being substantially circular in shape other shapes may be used without deviation from the spirit or scope of the invention.

A coil is also formed on the substrate so that the coil is wound around or otherwise surrounds at least a portion of the magnetic core . Any conventional manufacturing technique may be used to construct the coil . For example electrically conductive strips may be first deposited on the substrate prior to the magnetic core so that the magnetic core is deposited over a central portion of each strip . Electrically conductive wire bonds may then be used to connect the ends of adjacent strips together to complete the coil. Upon excitation of the coil electrical current flows through the coil creating a magnetic field in the magnetic core .

Still referring to a tuner is formed on the substrate . For instance the tuner may be constructed of a ferromagnetic material such as permalloy. The tuner is preferably elongated in shape having two ends . As shown the width of the tuner may be larger than the width of said air gap such that each end of the tuner overlies a corresponding portion of the core on opposite sides of the air gap .

In order to vary the inductance of the MEMS tunable inductor an actuator together with the tuner are mounted within a recessed area on the substrate . The actuator is mechanically connected to the tuner so that a movable portion of the actuator and tuner move in unison with each other. An elongated member of the moveable portion of the actuator is displaceable through the air gap . The actuator is configured to move the tuner in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane defined by the ends of the magnetic core and the air gap .

The actuator may be an electrostatic actuator for example having an immovable actuator part . Although in other embodiments the actuator may be a piezoelectric actuator or other type of actuator. In response to a control signal such as an electrical signal the actuator parts and variably separate from their position in to move the tuner relative to the core to their position in . The actuator also may include at least one spring to bias the position of the tuner in a known position. The spring s may be positioned at other locations than what is illustrated in the figures.

With reference now to in operation upon application of a control signal to the actuator the actuator moves the tuner between a first position illustrated in and a second position illustrated in and or intermediate positions there between. In doing so the spacing between the tuner and the magnetic core in the vicinity of the air gap is varied to thereby vary the overall inductance of the inductor .

The spacing is a result of the physical separation between the surface of the tuner and the surface of the magnetic core in the vicinity of the air gap . In some instances the spacing may be defined as the perpendicular distance between a surface of the magnetic core and a surface of the tuner in the vicinity of the air gap for instance. Although it should be appreciated that the spacing might be defined by other geometric conventions relative to those parts.

In the first position the spacing between the tuner and the magnetic core in the vicinity of the air gap may be at a minimum. Moreover in some embodiments in the first position the surface of the tuner near its ends physically contacts or abuts the surface of the magnetic core near its ends thus closing the spacing between the tuner and the magnetic core in the vicinity of the air gap . As a result the tuner effectively bridges and closes the air gap of the magnetic core . This greatly increases the overall inductance of the inductor .

When in the second position the surface of the tuner near its ends is physically separated from the surface of the magnetic core near its ends . As a result the spacing between the tuner and the magnetic core in the vicinity of the air gap may be at a maximum.

Moreover the actuator may enable continuous variable tuning capability. For example the actuator may be configured to move the tuner relative to the magnetic core to any intermediate position between the first position see and second position see for selectively varying the inductance of the inductor . Depending on the type and or operation of actuator provided the actuator may provide the ability to smoothly tune without requiring discrete step tuning.

Embodiments of the present invention can be used to provide controlled tuning of an inductor by controlling the air gap in the magnetic core . The width of the air gap between ends of the magnetic core may be on the order of a few millimeters for instance. Yet the spacing between the surface of the tuner and the surface of the magnetic core can be made much smaller than the width of the air gap . And the distance that the tuner needs to move e.g. between the first position and second position to bridge and close the air gap can be made much less.

The tunable inductor embodiments described herein may be used for load matching to improve power efficiency in power systems and converters for instance. In addition to power applications the tunable inductors may be used for radio frequency RF and other communication systems such as radios and cellular telephones. The tunable inductors can allow transceivers to shift between frequency bands. Other applications for the tunable inductors include their use as tunable filters voltage controlled oscillators VCOs matching networks and possibly as an alternative to tunable capacitors in an electrical resonator circuit e.g. a LC tank . The tunable inductors could also be used as a sensor device where inductance corresponds to a measured deflection of the magnetic core. If tuning ratios are large they might also be considered for tunable meta materials and tunable discrete transmission lines.

The tunable inductor embodiments advantageously allow for a tuning ratio an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional tuning inductors. For example the embodiments of the present invention may provide a tuning ratio in the hundreds whereas conventional inductors have a tuning ratio of only about 2 10. And since one tunable inductor can provide a greater tuning ratio it can eliminate or reduce the need for multiple inductors within a given system. By contrast for conventional inductors larger tuning ratios of app. 10 tend to be based on using MEMS switches to switch the total number of inductors placed in series which are very area intensive and have high resistances due to the switch contact resistances. Accordingly smaller lighter faster and more energy efficient lower loss inductors may be realized by the present invention.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a tunable inductor in which the inductance of the inductor may be varied over a wide range of inductance by varying the effective air gap of an air gap magnetic core. The ability to vary the inductance of the inductor over a wide range of inductance enables the inductor to be used in a wide range of applications including power and communication applications.

Having described my invention many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
