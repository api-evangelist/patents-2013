title: Dynamically generated graphical user interface for interactive voice response
abstract: A device may be configured to receive information regarding a call center. The received information may include an interactive voice response (“IVR”) menu configuration that includes contact information for contacts associated with the call center, and audible options to place a call to the contacts via the contact information for the contacts. The device may parse the IVR menu configuration to generate a graphical user interface (“GUI”) menu configuration, which may comprise visual selectable options that correspond to the audible options. Selection of a particular one of the visual selectable options may cause a call to be placed to a particular contact that is associated with the particular visual selectable option. The device may further store or output the GUI menu configuration.

Companies often use interactive voice response IVR systems to route telephone calls from customers to representatives that are relevant to customers needs. IVR systems may make use of automated messages played back to users to represent menus and menu options and may allow users to navigate the menus by providing vocal feedback and or by pressing keys on a number pad.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

From the standpoint of entities that use IVR systems these systems may be an efficient low cost technique for handling and routing telephone calls. However from the standpoint of callers these systems may prove problematic in that using them may be time consuming and ultimately frustrating. For example a caller may need to listen to numerous irrelevant menu options before a relevant option is presented which may be an inefficient use of the caller s time.

Some implementations described herein may provide an efficient visual representation of menus that have traditionally been provided via audio based systems such as IVR systems. Using these menus users may more quickly and efficiently choose the correct recipient of a call thus potentially saving users time. In some implementations the visual menus may also provide up to date information in real time thereby allowing users to make educated decisions on whom to call or when to place calls. For example this up to date information may indicate an expected wait time for each potential call recipient. Companies that use such visual systems may realize a benefit by improving customers user experience thereby potentially increasing the goodwill of the company. Using such a visual interaction method calling users are also able to provide more descriptive information about the purposes of their calls via web interaction while waiting for calls to be made or connected. Furthermore users inputs feedbacks and or histories can also be immediately available to the call recipient so that the users can be served more efficiently.

As shown in a call center web server may receive menu configuration information from a call center. This menu configuration information may in some implementations be a menu configuration file that is also used in IVR systems for the call center. In this sense the call center web server may be capable of generating visual menus based on existing IVR menus thus expediting setup of the visual menus of some implementations described herein. The call center web server may also in some implementations receive real time call center information from the call center e.g. expected wait times for different telephone numbers associated with the call center . The call center web server may also in some implementations collect user information such as user ID password or other useful information and retrieve history information regarding users from a history database.

The call center web server may generate visual menus and may provide the visual menus to a customer user device. For instance the customer user device may be a desktop computer or a smartphone associated with a customer who wishes to call the call center. The call center web server may for example provide the visual menus in the form of or as part of a web page provided in response to a request from the customer user device. As described further below the menus may provide information regarding various potential call recipients associated with the call center which the customer may call. In some implementations the customer user device may be capable of making a call to the call center using a Web Real Time Communications WebRTC application programming interface API which may be facilitated by a WebRTC gateway.

As mentioned above visual presentation of menus may simplify and expedite the user experience in navigating menus that are traditionally presented via IVR systems. For instance conceptually illustrates a set of menus that may be presented via IVR. As shown a user may be presented initially with a main menu and given four options each corresponding to a key press between 0 and 3. Upon pressing 0 for instance the user may be presented with an audio message message A and the user s call may be routed to a particular telephone number TN1 . Upon pressing 3 the user may be presented with another audio message message C which may correspond to another set of options that are presented to the user. Assume that the user desires to eventually call the telephone number that corresponds to the following sequence of key presses 3 1 2. The user would have to listen to the entirety of message C message F and message K before the call is routed to the telephone number which the user ultimately desires to call which may be time consuming and frustrating from the point of view of the user.

As further shown in an Upload file button may be present. Using this option a user may upload a file e.g. a video clip an audio clip an image a text document and or another type of file . In some implementations the call center web server may receive this file from the user s device store the file until the user s call is connected and provide the file to the recipient e.g. via a data connection via email or via another transmission technique .

As shown assume that a user selects Modify an existing order. The selection of this option may yield a sub menu the Order modification menu shown in . This sub menu may correspond to for example Sub menu 1 shown in . As shown assume that the user selects the option Cancel order which may correspond to option 1 under sub menu 1 in . As shown in the selection of the Cancel order option may yield yet another sub menu Please select reason. This sub menu may correspond to for instance Sub menu 2 shown in . As further shown in assume that the user selects the option No longer want item s . This option may correspond to for example option 2 under sub menu 2 shown in . As shown in this option may correspond to the telephone number TN8. As shown in the user may be presented with the option to place a call which may be a call to the telephone number TN8. As further shown in the average wait time 4 mins may be displayed with the Place call option. As may be apparent from a user s navigation of a previously long and complicated IVR menu may be simplified and expedited by presenting the same options in a visual manner. Additionally at each step a user may be allowed to input as much necessary supporting information as possible in the form of text pictures video clips files or other types of information. Based on the provided information a call recipient may view provide personalized service to the user thus improving the user s experience.

User device may include any computation and communication device that is capable of directly or indirectly communicating with one or more networks such as PDN IMS core PSTN . In some implementations user device may communicate with PDN IMS core or PSTN via one or more access networks such as access network . User device may include for example a desktop computer a laptop computer a radiotelephone a personal communications system PCS terminal e.g. a device that combines a cellular radiotelephone with data processing and data communications capabilities a personal digital assistant PDA e.g. that can include a radiotelephone a pager Internet intranet access etc. a smart phone a tablet computer a camera a personal gaming system or another type of computation and communication device. In some implementations user device may execute one or more software applications such as a web browser that is capable of communicating via data connections e.g. a data connection that is based on a WebRTC API .

In some implementations a particular user device may be associated with a user e.g. a customer who wishes to place a call to a call center using a graphical menu. In some implementations another user device or a set of user devices may be associated with a call center which receives calls from user devices associated with users.

Call center web server may include any computation and communication device that generates graphical menus based on IVR based menus and provides these graphical menus to one or more user devices . As will be further described call center web server may additionally receive real time status information from a call center e.g. from user devices associated with the call center from another device and or from a user associated with the call center and may present the real time status information to users. In some implementations call center web server may receive a file from user device e.g. a user device associated with a caller and may provide the file to another user device e.g. a user device associated with a call center .

Access network may include one or more wired and or wireless networks via which user device may communicate with other networks such as with PDN . Access network may in some implementations include a radio access network RAN that is associated with an evolved packet system EPS that includes a LTE network and or an evolved packet core EPC network that operate based on a Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP wireless communication standard. The RAN may include one or more base stations some or all of which may take the form of an evolved node B eNB via which user device may communicate with the EPC network. The EPC network may include one or more serving gateways SGWs PDN gateways PGWs and or mobility management entities MMEs and may enable user device to communicate with PDN and or IMS core . In some implementations access network may additionally or alternatively include other types of networks such as a wired Local Area Network LAN a wireless LAN and or another type of network.

PDN may include one or more wired and or wireless networks. PDN may include for example a wide area network WAN such as the Internet or one or more other packet switched networks. User device may connect through PDN to other networks data servers application servers or other servers applications that are coupled to PDN .

IMS core may include one or more computation and communication devices that implement IMS functionality of a long term evolution LTE network. IMS core may include for example one or more Call Session Control Function CSCF devices a Home Subscriber Server Authentication Authorization and Accounting HSS AAA server and or other devices. The CSCF may facilitate the establishment and de establishment of media sessions. The CSCF may communicate with devices outside of IMS core using for example SIP and or MSRP messages. The HSS AAA server may assist in the provisioning of network resources for IMS subscribers and IMS based services.

PSTN may include a circuit switched network that allows for communication between devices. For instance PSTN may allow for communication between traditional landline telephones.

WebRTC IMS gateway may include any computation and communication device that facilitates communication between user device and IMS core . For example WebRTC IMS gateway may translate messages sent from user device to IMS core from WebRTC messaging to a messaging protocol that is supported by IMS core e.g. Session Initiation Protocol SIP and or Message Session Relay Protocol MSRP and vice versa. In some implementations WebRTC IMS gateway may be incorporated as part of IMS core may connect to IMS core via PDN or may communicate with IMS core in another fashion.

As shown in example data structure may correspond to call center CC4. Data structure may include information regarding several contact numbers Contact associated with call center CC4 average wait times associated with the contact numbers and capabilities of the contact numbers. The contact number field for a particular contact may specify contact information e.g. a telephone number an Internet Protocol IP address a Uniform Resource Locator URL and or another identifier which may be used to reach the particular contact. The average wait time field may specify an average amount of time a user may be expect to wait before a live operator is available to communicate with the user. The capabilities field may indicate technological capabilities of a respective contact number. For example one contact may be capable of only voice calls while other contacts may be capable of voice video chat file transfer and or other capabilities. In some implementations the capabilities field may indicate protocols e.g. application level protocols via which a particular contact is capable of communicating.

In some implementations the data stored in data structure may be periodically or intermittently received from a device that determines on an on going basis real time information associated with a call center. For example some or all of the data stored in data structure may be received from a device that periodically or intermittently determines wait times associated with various numbers associated with contact numbers of a call center. In some implementations some or all of the data stored in data structure may be received from a user e.g. an administrator an operator and or another user associated with a corresponding call center.

The IVR menu configuration for a particular call center may conceptually resemble for example the IVR menu tree shown in . In some implementations the IVR menu configuration may be in the form of an Extensible Markup Language XML file and or another type of file. In some instances the IVR menu configuration may conceptually be viewed as a finite state machine FSM in that a user may traverse the IVR menu one state at a time with defined pathways e.g. key press options from state to state. In some implementations the IVR menu configuration stored in data structure may be the same as information used by an IVR system. In some implementations the IVR menu configuration information may include assets such as audio files which may be played when certain options are selected.

The GUI menu configuration for a particular call center may be information that specifies graphical menus that may be presented to users. In some implementations call center web server may automatically generate a GUI menu configuration based on an IVR menu configuration. For instance as described below call center web server may parse the IVR menu configuration in order to generate visual menus that are convenient for a user to traverse. In some implementations generating a GUI menu configuration based on an IVR menu configuration may include identifying menus and sub menus determining options specified in the IVR menu configuration identifying duplicate options removing options and or other actions as will be described further below.

While example implementations of data structures and are described above other variations are possible in practice. For instance in some situations one particular call center web server may be associated with one particular call center. In these situations call center web server may not store data structure but may store an instance of data structure as well as IVR menu configuration information and GUI menu configuration information for the call center. As another example in some implementations call center web server may forgo storing IVR menu configuration information for a particular call center and or may forgo storing capability information for a particular contact.

Process may include receiving call center registration information including menu configuration information block . For example call center web server may receive registration information e.g. from an administrator associated with call center web server and or programmatically via a software interface regarding a call center. The registration information may include some or all of the information for a particular call center shown in . For instance the registration information may include a telephone number or an identifier associated with another mode of contact such as an IP address a URL etc. associated with the call center. In some implementations the received registration information may also include IVR menu configuration information that is information that is used to configure an IVR system. In some implementations this IVR menu configuration may be unmodified as compared to IVR menu configuration information that controls an IVR system. As mentioned above the IVR menu configuration may be in the form of or may include one or more XML files that specify an IVR menu configuration.

As also mentioned above the registration information may also include information identifying call center contacts associated with the call center. These call center contacts may correspond to selectable options in the IVR menu configuration. In some implementations the registration information may also include capability information for some or all of the contacts which may indicate communication methodologies via which the contacts are able to communicate.

Process may also include parsing the menu configuration information to generate one or more visual menus block . For example call center web server may parse the IVR menu configuration received at block in order to generate a GUI menu configuration. With the exception of some circumstances some examples of which are presented below call center web server may identify options in the IVR menu configuration as well as options to take when those options are selected. For instance some options may cause a telephone number to be called while other options may cause another menu e.g. a sub menu to be displayed. Some options may additionally or alternatively cause an audio file to be played.

As mentioned above some exceptions may exist when generating a GUI menu configuration based on an IVR menu configuration. These exceptions may occur in order to more finely tailor the existing IVR menu configuration into a polished visual based menu configuration. The following exceptions are examples of how call center web server may parse the IVR menu configuration however in practice other options are possible.

For example in some implementations call center web server may identify and consolidate duplicate options that appear multiple times. For instance call center web server may identify that the same telephone number appears at multiple levels of the IVR menu. When generating the GUI menu configuration call center web server may include only a single menu option which corresponds to the telephone number as opposed to including multiple menu options. In some implementations as shown in example GUI this consolidated menu option may be presented separately from other menu options in the GUI. For example the consolidated menu option may correspond to a general purpose operator contact.

In some implementations call center web server may identify menu options in the IVR menu configuration that would not make sense to include in a graphical menu. For example call center web server may identify IVR menu options that correspond to invalid user input e.g. menu options that are tagged with invalid user input or other indicators of invalid user input timeout delay e.g. menu options that are related to a pre set amount of time during which an option has not been selected etc. and may forgo including these options in the GUI menu configuration.

In some implementations call center web server may identify options that cause an already presented menu to be re presented. For example one particular option may correspond to repeating the current menu e.g. To repeat these options press 9 or To return to the main menu press 7 . Call center web server may forgo including these options multiple times as it would be unnecessary to include the same menu multiple times in a visual based menu configuration.

Process may additionally include storing and or outputting information regarding the visual menus block . For instance call center web server may store the GUI menu configuration information generated at block in data structure or may output the information to another device. In some implementations call center web server may generate and or store executable code based on the generated GUI menu configuration. For example in some instances call center web server may generate server side executable code e.g. Personal Home Page PHP code Java Servlet code Active Server Pages ASP code etc. that may include graphical menu elements select object elements e.g. buttons and or other GUI elements that represent the generated GUI menu configuration information. In some implementations call center web server may output the generated code to a developer who may review and or modify the code.

Process may further include periodically or intermittently receiving real time update information block . For example call center web server may receive on a regular basis or in some implementations on an irregular basis information regarding a call center or regarding individual call center contacts. This information may include for example average expected wait times associated with call center contacts within a call center.

Process may also include updating the stored call center information based on the real time update information block . For example call center web server may update data structure when real time information is received at block . As further shown in blocks and may repeat in order for real time information regarding the call center to be continuously maintained.

Process may include receiving a request for a call center contact page block . For instance call center web server or another web server may receive a request from user device for a call center contact page. This request may correspond to for example a HyperText Transfer Protocol HTML GET request that includes a URL of a web page that includes contact information for a company. In some implementations this web page may include code e.g. client side JavaScript or PHP code that causes user device e.g. a browser running on user device to communicate with call center web server and to present information in a manner that is controlled by call center web server e.g. by server side JavaScript or PHP code . In some implementations the code may identify a call center associated with the call center contact page e.g. may indicate a telephone number associated with the call center a name of the call center and or another identifier that may be used to identify the call center .

Process may also include identifying menus and real time update information associated with the call center block . For example referring to the example shown in call center web server may identify a GUI menu configuration information and in some implementations other data such as some or all of the information shown in data structure and or other data regarding the call center. As mentioned above the GUI menu configuration information may include code e.g. server side JavaScript or PHP code that corresponds to a set of graphical menus.

Process may additionally include outputting the menus and real time update information block . For example call center web server may execute the server side code to present the graphical menus and real time update information e.g. information stored in data structure according to the GUI menu configuration information.

Process may further include periodically or intermittently providing updated real time update information block . For example when real time update information is received regarding the call center or contacts within the call center call center web server may update the GUI presented to user device . In this manner user device may display information that is consistent with update information received or stored by call center web server .

Process may include receiving a call center contact page including visual menus block . For example user device may receive a web page that includes a GUI which includes menus pertaining to options to contact a call center. As described above with respect to this web page may include client side code e.g. JavaScript PHP or other code to display a GUI that is generated and or presented by call center web server . The GUI may be similar to GUI described above with respect to to GUI described below with respect to and or another GUI.

Process may also include visually presenting the received menus block . For instance user device may visually present the received GUI which includes the menu s included in the GUI configuration information associated with the received web page. In some implementations user device may present the GUI via a web browser and or another software application running on user device e.g. a dedicated application that is used to place calls .

Process may additionally include receiving a menu selection of a desired entity to contact block . For instance user device may receive a selection of a contact within the call center that a user of user device desires to call. As described above this menu selection may be made by the user in a more expedient and convenient manner than if the user had been forced to listen to menu options via an IVR system.

Process may further include placing a call to the contact information using information in the received contact page block . For example user device may place a call according to the capabilities of the selected contact as well as the capabilities of user device . For instance if user device is capable of placing a WebRTC call and the selected contact is capable of multimedia e.g. voice and video calls user device may place a WebRTC call. In some implementations when placing the WebRTC call user device may communicate with WebRTC IMS gateway which may facilitate communications between user device and an IMS core e.g. IMS core which may itself ultimately facilitate communication between user device and the selected contact. As another example in some implementations user device may place a voice over IP VoIP call to the selected contact. As yet another example user device may place a call e.g. a voice call a video call and or a chat session to the selected contact using an over the top OTT communication application.

As further shown each option may display a wait time associated with the option. For instance the defective items option may have a wait time of 0 minutes whereas the add items option may have a wait time of 4 minutes. As additionally shown different calling options may be available. For instance the contact for place a new order may only have voice capability while the contact for order not yet received may have voice and video capability. Based on these capabilities for instance based on capability information stored by call center web server GUI may include selectable user interface options e.g. buttons which a user may use to place particular types of calls to intended contacts.

Further in some implementations some or all of the options shown in may be associated with a sound clip. These sound clips may in traditional IVR systems be associated with particular options. GUI may in some implementations include some or all of these clips in a manner that indicates which clips are associated with which options. For instance as shown a particular display area associated with a particular call center contact may include a play button indicated by a circle with a shaded triangle which a user may select in order to play the respective sound clip.

Bus may include one or more communication paths that permit communication among the components of device . Processor may include a processor microprocessor or processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions. Memory may include any type of dynamic storage device that may store information and instructions for execution by processor and or any type of non volatile storage device that may store information for use by processor .

Input component may include a mechanism that permits an operator to input information to device such as a keyboard a keypad a button a switch etc. Output component may include a mechanism that outputs information to the operator such as a display a speaker one or more light emitting diodes LEDs etc.

Communication interface may include any transceiver like mechanism that enables device to communicate with other devices and or systems. For example communication interface may include an Ethernet interface an optical interface a coaxial interface or the like. Communication interface may include a wireless communication device such as an infrared IR receiver a Bluetooth radio a wireless LAN WLAN transceiver or the like. The wireless communication device may be coupled to an external device such as a remote control a wireless keyboard a mobile telephone etc. In some embodiments device may include more than one communication interface . For instance device may include an optical interface and an Ethernet interface.
