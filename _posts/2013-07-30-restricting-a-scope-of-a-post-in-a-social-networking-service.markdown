This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 677 434 filed Jul. 30 2012 and entitled RESTRICTING A SCOPE OF A POST IN A SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject technology generally relates to social networking services and in particular relates to restricting posts in a social networking service.

Some social networking services allow users to post data e.g. text images or videos and to share the data with all or a portion of their social contacts. The social contacts in turn may further share the posted data with others.

In some innovative aspects the disclosed subject matter relates to a computer implemented method. The method includes receiving from a first user a post for a first set of users. The method includes providing an indication of the post to at least a portion of the first set of users. The method includes receiving from a second user within the first set of users a request to further share the post with a third user. The method includes determining a maximum scope for the post. The method includes determining if the third user is within the maximum scope for the post. The method includes foregoing providing the indication of the post to the third user if the third user is not determined to be within the maximum scope for the post.

These and other embodiments can include one or more of the following features. The method also includes receiving from the first user an indication of the maximum scope where the maximum scope for the post is determined based on the received indication of the maximum scope. The maximum scope for the post includes all or a portion of users within a domain. The domain is defined statically. The domain is defined dynamically. The maximum scope is defined based on one or more attributes. The maximum scope is defined based on a geographic location. The geographic location specification includes one or more of a current geographic location a home geographic location a work geographic location or a default geographic location. The maximum scope is defined based on a time specification and the time specification includes at least an end time. The maximum scope is defined with one or more logical operators. The method also includes determining that the first set of users includes a subset of users where the subset of users is not within the maximum scope for the post providing to the first user an indication that the subset of users is not within the maximum scope for the post and receiving from the first user an indication of intent to broaden the maximum scope to include at least a portion of the subset of users or an indication of intent to forego sharing the post with the subset of users. The method also includes receiving from a fourth user a request to view the post determining whether the post has been shared with the fourth user determining whether the fourth user is within the maximum scope for the post if the post has been shared with the fourth user and the fourth user is within the maximum scope for the post providing to the fourth user the post for display and if the post has not been shared with the fourth user or the fourth user is not within the maximum scope for the post foregoing providing to the fourth user the post for display. The first set of users includes a fourth user. The fourth user is associated with an electronic messaging address that is not associated with an account within the social networking service. The method also includes determining based on the electronic messaging address that the fourth user is within the maximum scope for the post and providing an indication of the post to the fourth user via the electronic messaging address. A default maximum scope is set by an administrator. The determined maximum scope for the post is different from the default maximum scope set by the administrator. The method also includes receiving from the first user an indication of the maximum scope where the maximum scope for the post is determined based on the received indication of the maximum scope and verifying that the determined maximum scope for the post is narrower than or identical to the default maximum scope set by the administrator.

In some innovative aspects the disclosed subject matter relates to a computer readable medium encoded with executable instructions. The instructions include code for providing a first user interface element for entering a post for a social networking service for display. The instructions include code for providing a second user interface element for selecting one or more viewing users with which to share the post for display. The instructions include code for providing a third user interface element for selecting a maximum scope for the post for display. The instructions include code for receiving an indication of the post and a selection of the one or more viewing users. The instructions include code for if the maximum scope selected in the third user interface element includes the one or more viewing users selected in the second user interface element providing to at least a portion of the one or more viewing users an indication of the post. The instructions include code for if the maximum scope indicated in the third user interface element does not include at least one of the one or more viewing users selected in the second user interface element providing an input for modifying the selected maximum scope or the selected one or more viewing users.

These and other embodiments can include one or more of the following features. The instructions also include code for receiving a selection of the maximum scope. The third user interface element indicates a default maximum scope. The third user interface element is configured to receive from the user an input for selecting a maximum scope different from the default maximum scope. The default maximum scope is selected by an administrator. The received selection of the maximum scope includes the default maximum scope. The first user interface element includes an input box for entering text. The second user interface element includes one or more selectors for one or more social groups or one or more individual users of a social networking service. The third user interface element includes one or more selectors for one or more social groups or one or more individual users of a social networking service.

In some innovative aspects the disclosed subject matter relates to a system. The system includes one or more processors and a memory. The memory includes instructions executable by the one or more processors. The instructions include code for receiving from an administrator for plural users of a social networking service a maximum scope for posts by the plural users. The instructions include code for receiving from a first user from among the plural users of the social networking service a post for the social networking service and a selection of a first set of users with which to share the post. The instructions include code for if the maximum scope includes the first set of users providing an indication of the post to at least a portion of the first set of users. The instructions include code for if at least one user in the first set of users is not included in the maximum scope providing to the first user an indication that the at least one user is not included in the maximum scope.

These and other embodiments can include one or more of the following features. The instructions also include code for determining based on settings entered by the administrator whether the maximum scope is user modifiable if the maximum scope is user modifiable providing instructions to the first user to modify the maximum scope or the first set of users and if the maximum scope is not user modifiable providing a notification to the first user that the post cannot be shared with the at least one user.

Advantageously the subject technology allows a user of a social networking service to provide a maximum scope for his her posts in the social networking service. In some aspects the user may use the maximum scope feature to prevent information posted by him herself from being provided outside his her business or his her family. For example a user may wish to tell his her family members that he she is having a child while preventing this information from being decimated to users outside his her family. Alternatively a user may wish to update his her coworkers on the status of a project while preventing this information from being provided to people outside the business.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description where various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However it will be apparent that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.

As set forth above some social networking services allow users to post data e.g. text images or videos and to share the data with all or a portion of their social contacts. The social contacts in turn may further share the posted data with others. However a user posting data may not wish for the data to be further shared with other users of the social networking service. For example a user posting data related to a project in his her business may not want this information to be provided to users outside the business. Similarly a user posting data related to a social event may not want this information to be provided to users outside his her peer group and their spouses. As the foregoing illustrates an approach for restricting a scope of a post in a social networking service may be desirable.

The subject technology provides techniques for restricting a scope of a post in a social networking service. In some aspects when posting data a user may share the data with a first set of users and set a maximum scope of which users can view the data which may be broader than the first set of users. The maximum scope may be selected by the user or a default maximum scope may be set up for the user by an administrator e.g. an enterprise administrator for an enterprise account in the social networking service . The maximum scope defines limits for sharing or re sharing posts. For example a post can be shared or further shared with other user s within the maximum scope but not with users outside the maximum scope. In some aspects the maximum scope can be dynamic. The maximum scope can be specified based on rules or policies such that the maximum scope can change over time. The maximum scope may be administrator defined attribute based location based and or time based.

The input box is a text box for entering a post. As shown the user of the window A has entered in the input box the text Great work getting the project completed The dropdown arrow when selected for example via cursor causes a menu to appear. The menu includes an upload file button and a maximum scope button . The upload file button when selected provides an interface for uploading a file e.g. an image file a video file an audio file etc. to the social networking service with the post. The maximum scope button when selected or hovered over causes an interface for selecting a maximum scope to appear. Example interfaces for selecting a maximum scope are described in detail in conjunction with and below. The post button when selected causes the post entered in input box to be posted to the social networking service and shared with the user s selected via the sharing interface .

The sharing interface includes check boxes and for selecting user s of the social networking service with whom to share the post in input box . The user may select one or more individual users e.g. Jim DEF with whom to share the post and or one or more groups of users e.g. ABC Corporation Marketing Group with whom to share the post. For example the user creating the post may choose to share the post with My Friends My Family ABC Corporation ABC Corporation Marketing Group or custom contact s entered by the posting user in input box .

In some aspects My Friends and My Family may correspond to user defined social groups defined by the posting user accessing the window A. ABC Corporation and ABC Corporation Marketing Group may correspond to symmetric social network groups that are defined by an administrator. For example the ABC Corporation group may include all users who have an electronic messaging e.g. email address associated with ABC Corporation e.g. abc.com. ABC Corporation Marketing Group may correspond to a subset of the ABC Corporation group as defined by the user or an administrator of ABC Corporation.

As used herein user defined social groups are categories to which users can assign their social networking contacts and better control the distribution and visibility of social networking messages. In accordance with aspects of the subject disclosure a user defined social group is provided as a data set defining a collection of contacts that are associated with one another. A user defined social group can be described from the perspective of an individual that is the center of a particular collection of socially interconnected people or from the aggregate perspective of a collection of socially interconnected people. A user defined social group can have narrowly defined boundaries all of the members of the user defined social group may be familiar with one another and permission may be required for a member to join a user defined social group. A user of an electronic device may define a user defined social group and the user defined social group as a data set defining a collection of contacts may reflect a real life social group of the user.

As shown in the posting user of window A has selected to share the post with ABC Corporation Marketing Group and custom users as indicated in input box . The custom users indicated in input box are Jim DEF and Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu. The custom user may be outside the ABC Corporation Marketing Group . Jim DEF may be a user of the social networking service identified by an account. Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu may lack an account with the social networking service or the posting user may not know that Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu has such an account. As a result Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu may be identified by an electronic messaging e.g. email address rather than by a name or social networking account title.

In one example a user of an electronic device who has an individual account in the social networking service may have different groups of friends coworkers and family and there may be some overlap among those groups e.g. a coworker who is also considered to be a friend a family member who is also a coworker . Through the creation and use of user defined social groups the user can organize and categorize social networking contacts into various different groupings.

As shown the maximum scope menu includes a Global button a My Friends button a My Family button an ABC Corporation button and a Custom button . The Global button when selected sets a global maximum scope for the post i.e. the post may be further shared with anyone . The My Friends My Family and ABC Corporation buttons when selected set the maximum scope as indicated i.e. the post may be further shared only with users within the identified group . As shown the user has selected the ABC Corporation button via cursor . The Custom button when selected provides an interface for setting a custom maximum scope for the post e.g. window of described in detail below . The custom maximum scope may include for example any custom set of users as defined for example via Boolean operators e.g. AND OR XOR or NOT .

As illustrated in the posting user has set the maximum scope for the post to ABC Corporation via cursor in . However the user has shared the post with Jim DEF and Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu in input box where Jim DEF and Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu are not members of the ABC Corporation group. Sharing the post with users outside the maximum scope is inconsistent as under the maximum scope the users outside the maximum scope cannot view the post. However the posting user may modify the maximum scope. As a result of the inconsistency of the maximum scope with the set of users with who the post is to be shared in some implementations pop up window C of or a similar interface may be presented. As shown the pop up window C notifies the user of the inconsistency and provides buttons to correct the inconsistency. Alternatively the maximum scope may be automatically adjusted to the union of the specified maximum scope and the users with whom the posting user has shared the post.

As shown the pop up window C includes a message an Edit Maximum Scope button and an Edit Sharing button . The message indicates that the posting user has selected to share the posts with users who are outside the maximum scope. The Edit Maximum Scope button when selected allows the posting user to modify the maximum scope to include all of the users with whom the posting user shared the post. The Edit Sharing button when selected allows the posting user to modify the users with whom he she is sharing the post to ensure that the users with whom the post is shared are within the maximum scope. The ability to modify the maximum scope may be limited to the posting user or an administrator. A user who further shares an existing post may not broaden its maximum scope and as a result may not share the post with user s outside of the maximum scope.

The window may be provided by an application executing on a client computing device. The application may be a web browser displaying a webpage a web browser executing a browser application a laptop or desktop computer application a tablet computer application a mobile phone application or a personal digital assistant PDA application.

As shown the window includes a post input box a post button an upload file button maximum scope input boxes and and requirement selectors and .

The post input box is configured to receive e.g. via operation of a mouse and keyboard an input for a post. The input may be text an image a video or an audio file. As shown the input includes a text sentence advertising a sale in a store in San Francisco during the week of Jul. 16 22 2012.

The post button when selected is configured to share the post with at least one user based on sharing settings for the post e.g. as entered via the interface or of or a similar interface . The upload file button when selected is configured to allow a user to upload a file to post to the social networking service. The file may be posted in conjunction with or in place of the text in the post input box .

The maximum scope input boxes include a user data input box a geography input box and a time input box . The text within the input boxes and is entered by a posting user accessing the window . In some examples the user is required to follow syntax rules for entering text into input boxes and . For example the user may be required to enter Boolean expressions with multiple parts of the expression expressed within parentheses and connected with one another using logical operators for example AND OR or XOR. In some examples text may be entered into input boxes and in free form. The free form text may be converted to a Boolean expression using artificial intelligence stored at a server. The user data input box may include a Boolean expression based on any characteristics of users known to the social networking service and accessible to the posting user. Specific characteristics e.g. lives in Seattle or attributes e.g. gender is male or is a fan of Boston sports teams may be input to the Boolean expression. Boolean expression s using different characteristics or attributes may be used to define the maximum scope. For example as shown in input box the user entered the Boolean expression Prefers San Francisco Sports AND gender female OR Prefers JKL Dress Shop . Thus under the maximum scope the post may be shared with users of the social networking service who are known to the posting user to have the characteristics in the Boolean expression but not to other users. These users may be known or believed by the posting user to have a greater interest in the sale at the store in San Francisco than other users. A user of a social networking service may prefer a webpage sports team business etc. if he she indicated to the social networking service that he she is interested in the object of preference. In some examples the user explicitly indicates item s that he she prefers. For example the user may click a prefer button on a page associated with a sports team in the social networking service to indicate his her preference for the sports team. Alternatively the user s preference may be implied form user activity that is known in the social networking service. For example if a user enters multiple posts about the Boston Red Sox sports team the user is likely to be interested in or have a preference for the Boston Red Sox. The user is provided with an indication that his her preference for certain item s is implied and the user provides affirmative consent for his her preference to be stored by the social networking service.

The geography input box is configured to receive a Boolean expression related to geographic information of users of the social networking service who are to be placed within the maximum scope for the post. The geographic information may be based on geographic location s of the users e.g. a home location a work location a default location or a current location. Any user of the social networking service may share one or more of the above locations for him herself as either an exact location e.g. a street address or a non exact location e.g. a city or a state . For example a user may list his her work geographic location as Miami Fla. and share this location only with his her social contacts and refuse to share his her current geographic location with the social networking service. As shown a user is within the maximum scope for the post only if his her current geographic location is San Francisco his her home geographic location is within 100 kilometers of San Francisco or his her work geographic location is within 50 kilometers of San Francisco. The posting user may have selected these characteristics as users who live or work near San Francisco or who are currently located in San Francisco are more likely to visit the store that users who are not in San Francisco.

The time input box is configured to receive a Boolean expression related to time information. As shown the time input box indicates that the date is on or after Jul. 16 2012 and the date is on or before Jul. 22 2012. The posting user may have selected these characteristics as the post is not relevant before Jul. 16 2012 or after Jul. 22 2012 as the sale that the post is discussing is not taking place during those dates.

The requirement selectors and allow the posting user to select to require all of the above i.e. user data input box Boolean expression AND geography input box Boolean expression AND time input box Boolean expression at least one of the above i.e. user data input box Boolean expression OR geography input box Boolean expression OR time input box Boolean expression or a custom combination of the Boolean expressions e.g. user data input box Boolean expression AND geography input box Boolean expression OR time input box Boolean expression .

It should be noted that illustrate some possible user interfaces for the subject technology. The subject technology may be used in conjunction with user interfaces that are set up in different ways. For example a posting user may be able to indicate a geographic location on a map or indicate a time on a calendar instead of typing the geographic location and time into a text input box as illustrated.

In some aspects a user may have multiple accounts with a social networking service for example a personal account associated with his her personal electronic messaging e.g. email address and an enterprise account associated with his her enterprise electronic messaging address. The enterprise account may be administered by an enterprise administrator while the personal account may not be associated with an enterprise administrator. In some aspects a user can have only a personal account or only an enterprise account with the social networking service. In other aspects the user can have multiple personal or multiple enterprise accounts. For example a user can have a first enterprise account with his her employer and a second enterprise account with his her university.

The enterprise administrator may define a default maximum scope for posts by the enterprise user account e.g. default maximum scope is visible only to users associated with the enterprise e.g. ABC Corporation . With a default maximum scope the posting user may override the maximum scope for any post. For example if the default maximums scope is ABC Corporation the posting user may change the maximum scope to Global My Friends ABC Corporation Marketing Group etc. for example via one or more of the interfaces A B C or .

Alternatively the enterprise administrator may provide a required maximum scope e.g. ABC Corporation for posts by users of the enterprise social networking accounts. Under the required maximum scope a user can set a narrower maximum scope for an individual post but not a broader maximum scope. For example the user can set the maximum scope to ABC Corporation Marketing Group which is a subset of ABC Corporation but not to Global.

The posting users may be notified of any limitations or default settings created by the administrator. The user may view or modify the maximum scope for his her posts for example via one or more of the interfaces A B C or .

In some aspects the posting user may be provided with a warning if he she is making a post via his her enterprise account with a maximum scope that includes users outside the enterprise. The warning may be similar to the interface C.

The data repository may store posts associated with a social networking service and related information e.g. the posting entity viewing entities or maximum scope . One example of the data repository is described in more detail in conjunction with below.

The server may include one or more modules for facilitating user interaction with the social networking service via a browser or a special purpose application executing on the client computing device . The server may be implemented as a single machine with a single processor a multi processor machine or a server farm including multiple machines with multiple processors. One example of the server is described in more detail in conjunction with below.

The client computing device may be a laptop computer a desktop computer a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a tablet computer a netbook a television with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto a physical machine or a virtual machine. The client computing device may include one or more of a keyboard a mouse a display or a touch screen. The client computing device may also include a web browser configured to display webpages for example a webpage of the social networking service or webpages associated with one or more of the windows A B C or . Alternatively windows A B C or associated with the social networking service may be presented on the client computing device via a special purpose application which may be associated with the social networking service.

Each post . may include text an image a video and or an audio file posted to a social networking service.

The posting entity . is a user of the social networking service who created the post. For example as shown in the post Great work getting the project completed has as its posting entity a user of the social networking service who is accessing the page B.

The viewing entities . are entities who have been given permission to view the post with whom the post has been shard or to whom the post has been forwarded or further shared. Viewing entities . may further share the post creating additional viewing entities within the maximum scope. For example User X may be a posting entity and may share the post with User Y who may further share the post with User Z. In this case User X is the posting entity and Users Y and Z are the viewing entities. As shown in the viewing entities of the post are ABC Corporation Marketing Group Jim DEF and Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu.

The maximum scope . corresponds to a maximum group of viewing entities . that a post can possibly have. In some aspects the maximum scope . may be global. Alternatively the maximum scope . may correspond to one or more user defined social groups one or more business affiliations or a custom group of people. The maximum scope . may be expressed in terms of a group of people a time restriction or a geographic restriction as illustrated in maximum scope options and and maximum scope input boxes and .

The maximum scope . may include static elements that are rarely changed e.g. user accounts that are associated with the enterprise ABC Corporation user accounts that indicate a residence in San Francisco user accounts of female users etc. . The maximum scope . may include dynamic elements that are frequently changed e.g. user accounts that are sharing their geographic location and are currently located within 5 kilometers of JKL Supermarket user accounts that are accessing the social networking service during the week Jul. 16 22 2012 user accounts that entered geographic check ins at JKL Supermarket within the last month etc. . In some aspects the maximum scope . includes both static and dynamic elements e.g. user accounts that are associated with the enterprise ABC Corporation and that entered geographic check ins at JKL Supermarket within the last week .

The maximum scope . for a post . may be defined based on any attribute known about a user account by the social network that the user permits the social network to store and to use for sharing posts with the user. The user may access the information that the social network stores about the user e.g. the user s preferences geographic location employer educational history etc. and may modify or remove this information from the social networking service at any time. For example a post may be shared with accounts of users having an age between 18 24 users being fans of a certain baseball team users who are interested in chess etc. The users voluntarily provide their age their interest in the baseball team their interest in chess etc. to the social network and can remove this information from the social network at any time. In one example a maximum scope .may restrict sharing of a post .to employees of ABC Corporation who are viewing the post in the month of January are interested in chess currently reside in Texas and went to high school in the United States but not in the State of Texas. The above maximum scope could be written as a Boolean expression with logical operators.

The receive new post module is configured to receive via a first user account of a social networking service a post e.g. post . for the social networking service a selection of a first set of user accounts with which to share the post viewing entities . and an indication of a maximum scope for the post . . The post the first set of user accounts with which to share the post and the indication of the maximum scope may be received via a client computing device e.g. client computing device using interface A OOB or or a similar interface. For example as shown in the post is Great work getting the project completed The first set of users with which to share the post is ABC Corporation Marketing Group Jim DEF and Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu. The maximum scope is ABC Corporation. The receive new post module is also configured to provide an indication of the post to at least a portion of the first set of user accounts with which to share the post. For example when a user accesses the social networking service via an account with which the post was shared an account in the first set the post may be presented in a feed for the account in the social networking service.

The further share existing post module is configured to receive via an account of a user who is permitted to view a post e.g. a viewing entity .or a member of the first set of user accounts described above a request to further share e.g. re share the post with an additional user account. The user who is permitted to view the post may be accessing the post in the social networking service via a client computing device e.g. client computing device . In response the further share existing post module determines whether the additional user account is within the maximum scope e.g. maximum scope . for the post. If the additional user account is within the maximum scope then the further share existing post module provides the indication of the post to the additional user account. When a user associated with the third user account accesses the social networking service the post is presented in a feed of the additional user account. If the additional user account is not within the maximum scope then the further share existing post module foregoes providing the indication of the post to the additional user account.

The display post module is configured to receive via a specified user account a request to view a post e.g. post . within the social networking service. The request to view the post can be a request to view a single post or a request to view a feed or a stream that includes multiple posts that include the post. For example the user may request to view his her own content stream by logging into the social network or the user may access a feed of one of his her social contacts that includes multiple posts by the social contact. The specified user account may be accessed via a client computing device e.g. client computing device . In one example the client computing device may be logged into the specified user account and may attempt to access a uniform resource locator URL associated with the post e.g. via a link in an electronic message . The user may see the URL associated with the post while the user is not within the maximum scope for the post for example if another user who is within the maximum scope sends to the user an electronic message e.g. an email message including a link to the post. The display post module is configured to determine whether the post has been shared with the specified user account e.g. whether the specified user account is one of the viewing entities . and whether the specified user account is within the maximum scope for the post e.g. maximum scope . . If the post has been shared with the specified user account and the specified user account is within the maximum scope for the post then the display post module provides to the client computing device associated with the specified user account the post for display. If the post has not been shared with the specified user account or the specified user account is not within the maximum scope for the post then the display post module foregoes providing to the client computing device associated with the specified user account the post for display.

In step the server e.g. server receives via a first user account of a social networking service e.g. via a client computing device that is accessing the first user account a post e.g. post . for the social networking service a selection of a first set of user accounts with which to share the post e.g. viewing entities . and an indication of a maximum scope for the post e.g. maximum scope . . For example the post the selection of the first set of user accounts with which to share the post and the maximum scope may be entered via the interfaces A and B of .

The maximum scope may be global e.g. all users of the social networking service or all Internet users even those lacking an account in the social networking service . Alternatively the maximum scope may include all or a portion of user accounts within an enterprise domain e.g. ABC Corporation ABC Corporation Marketing Group or ABC Corporation Marketing Group and ABC Corporation Sales Group etc. . Membership in an enterprise domain may be determined based on an electronic messaging address associated with an account. For example a user account may be associated with the ABC Corporation enterprise domain if the user account is associated with a ABC Corp.com email address. Otherwise the user account may not be associated with the ABC Corporation enterprise domain.

In some examples the maximum scope may be defined based on a geographic location specification e.g. all users who live or work within 100 kilometers of New York City . The geographic location specification may include one or more of a current geographic location a home geographic location a work geographic location or a default geographic location. However a user of the social networking service may refuse to share any of these geographic locations with the social networking service or with a portion of the users in the social networking service.

In some examples the maximum scope may be defined based on a time specification. The time specification may include a start time or an end time. For example the maximum scope may specify that a post may only be shared before Jun. 30 2012 or that the post may only be shared during the week of Jul. 16 22 2012.

In some aspects the maximum scope is defined with one or more logical operators e.g. AND OR XOR or NOT . The logical operators may be used to create multiple different specifications for the maximum scope e.g. a geographic location specification and a time specification . Example definitions of maximum scope using logical operators are illustrated in at elements and .

In some aspects for a first user account accessing the social networking service via an enterprise account a default maximum scope may be defined by an enterprise administrator. However the user may override the maximum scope set by the enterprise administrator to have a different maximum scope for a specific post. In some aspects the enterprise administrator may require that the maximum scope for posts by the user be narrower than i.e. include a subset of the accounts of or identical to the maximum scope defined by the enterprise administrator. For example an enterprise administrator at ABC Corporation may not want posts by the employees of ABC Corporation who access the social network using their enterprise accounts to be viewable by users who are not employed by ABC Corporation. To ensure that posts by the employees of ABC Corporation are not viewable by users who are not employed by ABC Corporation the enterprise administrator may require that all enterprise social networking accounts of ABC Corporation employees have a maximum scope that is narrower than or identical to Employed at ABC Corporation. 

A maximum scope may be defined or based on one or more domains. A domain may include an enterprise domain e.g. ABC Corporation an educational domain e.g. First City Campus of State University an organization domain e.g. Help Needy Families of First City Volunteers or any other known static domain. Alternatively the domain may include a dynamic domain which may be defined based on attributes location time and or other dynamic domains. For example a domain may include users who checked in at MNO Restaurant within the last week or users who are currently located within half a kilometer of MNO Restaurant.

In step the server provides an indication of the post to at least a portion of the first set of user accounts with which to share the post. For example the post may appear in the social network feeds for the portion of the first set of user accounts. When a client computing device logs into the social networking service via a user account in the first set the post may be displayed in a feed presented via the client computing device.

In some aspects the first set of user accounts with which to share the post may include a user account corresponding to an electronic messaging address. The electronic messaging address may not be associated with an account in the social networking service. If the server determines that that the electronic messaging address corresponds to an account within the maximum scope based on the electronic messaging address e.g. if the maximum scope corresponds to ABC Corporation and the electronic messaging address is a ABC Corp.com email address the server may provide an indication of the post to the user account via the electronic messaging address in conjunction with an invitation to open an account with the social networking service. If the server determines that the electronic messaging address does not correspond to an account within the maximum scope the process of described in detail below may be used to verify the intent of the posting user to modify the maximum scope or to avoid sharing the post with the user account outside the maximum scope.

In step the server receives via a second user account within the first set of user accounts e.g. via a client computing device logged into a second user account a request to further share e.g. re share the post with a third user account.

In step the server determines whether the third user account is within the maximum scope for the post as entered in step . If so the process continues to step . If not the process continues to step .

In step if the third user account is within the maximum scope for the post the server provides an indication of the post to the third user account. For example the post may appear in the social network feeds for the third user account. When a client computing device logs into the social networking service via the third user account the post may be displayed in a feed presented via the client computing device.

In step if the third user account is not within the maximum scope for the post the server foregoes providing the indication of the post to the third user account based on the third user account not being within the maximum scope for the post. As a result the maximum scope entered by the posting user is enforced and the post is not shared with user accounts outside the maximum scope.

In step where a server e.g. server receives via a first user account of a social networking service e.g. being accessed on a client computing device a post for the social networking service a selection of a first set of user accounts with which to share the post and an indication of a maximum scope for the post. For example as illustrated in the first set of user accounts with which to share the post includes ABC Corporation Marketing Group Jim DEF and Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu. The maximum scope is ABC Corporation. Step of the process may correspond to step of process .

In step the server determines whether the first set of user accounts includes a subset of user accounts where the subset of user accounts is not within the maximum scope for the post. For example as illustrated in Jim DEF and Cindy.GHI XYZ.edu may or may not be within the maximum scope ABC Corporation for the post. If the first set of user account includes such a subset of user accounts the process continues to step . If the first set of user accounts does not include such a subset of user accounts the process continues to step .

In step if the first set of user accounts includes the subset of user accounts where the subset of user accounts is not within the maximum scope for the post the server provides to the first user account e.g. via a client computing device an indication that the subset of user accounts is not within the maximum scope for the post e.g. via pop up window C of . The indication may identify the maximum scope or the subset of user accounts.

In step the server receives via the first user account an indication of intent to broaden the maximum scope to include at least a portion of the subset of user accounts e.g. a selection of the Edit Maximum Scope button of or an indication of intent to forego sharing the post with the subset of user accounts e.g. a selection of the Edit Sharing button of . As a result of steps and a user may avoid accidentally sharing information with another user who is not within the maximum scope for the post.

If the first user account is not the account that posted the post or if an administrator e.g. an enterprise administrator prevented modification of the maximum scope for the posts of the first user the first user account is unable to modify the maximum scope. In such circumstances the first user account receives e.g. on a client computing device accessing the first user account a notification that the post cannot be shared with the users outside the maximum scope.

In step the server provides an indication of the post to at least a portion of the first set of user accounts. The portion of the first set of user account includes user accounts that are within the maximum scope as originally selected or modified by the first user account. Step of the process may correspond to step of the process .

In step where a server e.g. server receives via a specified user account a request to view a post within a social networking service. For example a user of a client computing device logged into the user account may enter a uniform resource locator URL corresponding to the post or select a link to the URL. Alternatively the user of the client computing device may request to view a feed or a stream that contains the post.

In step the server determines whether the post has been shared with the specified user account e.g. if the user account is within the viewing entities .corresponding to the post . . If so the process continues to step . If not the process continues to step .

In step if the post has been shared with the specified user account the server determines whether the specified user account is within a maximum scope for the post or whether the maximum scope for the post e.g. expressed in terms of time or geography allows sharing the post with the specified user account. The specified user account may be within the maximum scope for the post if the user account is within a set of user accounts as defined in the maximum scope that can view the post. If so the process continues to step . If not the process continues to step .

In step if the post has been shared with the specified user account and the specified user account is within the maximum scope for the post the server provides to the specified user account accessed via a client computing device the post for display.

In step if the post has not been shared with the specified user account or the specified user account is not within the maximum scope for the post the server foregoes providing to the specified user account the post for display.

The subject technology is described above in conjunction with posts in a social networking service. However the subject technology may also be applicable to other content items that may be shared and to which access may be restricted by a posting user. For example the subject technology could be used with documents in a document sharing service or videos in a video sharing service in place of or in addition to posts in a social networking service as described above.

Although certain examples provided herein describe a user s information being stored in memory the user can delete the user information from memory and or opt out of having the user information stored in memory. In example aspects the user can adjust appropriate privacy settings to selectively limit the types of user information stored in memory or select the memory in which the user information is stored e.g. locally on the user s device as opposed to remotely a server . In example aspects the user information does not include and or share the specific identification of the user e.g. the user s name unless otherwise specifically provided or directed by the user.

The bus collectively represents all system peripheral and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of the electronic system . For instance the bus communicatively connects the processing unit s with the read only memory the system memory and the permanent storage device .

From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the subject technology. The processing unit s can be a single processor or a multi core processor in different implementations.

The read only memory ROM stores static data and instructions that are needed by the processing unit s and other modules of the electronic system. The permanent storage device on the other hand is a read and write memory device. This device is a non volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the electronic system is off. Some implementations of the subject technology use a mass storage device for example a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive as the permanent storage device .

Other implementations use a removable storage device for example a floppy disk flash drive and its corresponding disk drive as the permanent storage device . Like the permanent storage device the system memory is a read and write memory device. However unlike storage device the system memory is a volatile read and write memory such a random access memory. The system memory stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some implementations the processes of the subject technology are stored in the system memory the permanent storage device or the read only memory . For example the various memory units include instructions for restricting a scope of a post in a social networking service in accordance with some implementations. From these various memory units the processing unit s retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some implementations.

The bus also connects to the input and output device interfaces and . The input device interface enables the user to communicate information and select commands to the electronic system. Input devices used with input device interface include for example alphanumeric keyboards and pointing devices also called cursor control devices . Output device interfaces enables for example the display of images generated by the electronic system . Output devices used with output device interface include for example printers and display devices for example liquid crystal displays LCD . Some implementations include devices for example a touchscreen that functions as both input and output devices.

Finally as shown in bus also couples electronic system to a network not shown through a network interface . In this manner the electronic system can be a part of a network of computers for example a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or an Intranet or a network of networks for example the Internet. Any or all components of electronic system can be used in conjunction with the subject technology.

The above described features and applications can be implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a computer readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium . When these instructions are executed by one or more processing unit s e.g. one or more processors cores of processors or other processing units they cause the processing unit s to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to CD ROMs flash drives RAM chips hard drives EPROMs etc. The computer readable media does not include carrier waves and electronic signals passing wirelessly or over wired connections.

In this specification the term software is meant to include firmware residing in read only memory or applications stored in magnetic storage or flash storage for example a solid state drive which can be read into memory for processing by a processor. Also in some implementations multiple software technologies can be implemented as sub parts of a larger program while remaining distinct software technologies. In some implementations multiple software technologies can also be implemented as separate programs. Finally any combination of separate programs that together implement a software technology described here is within the scope of the subject technology. In some implementations the software programs when installed to operate on one or more electronic systems define one or more specific machine implementations that execute and perform the operations of the software programs.

A computer program also known as a program software software application script or code can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages declarative or procedural languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine object or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may but need not correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code . A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

These functions described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry in computer software firmware or hardware. The techniques can be implemented using one or more computer program products. Programmable processors and computers can be included in or packaged as mobile devices. The processes and logic flows can be performed by one or more programmable processors and by one or more programmable logic circuitry. General and special purpose computing devices and storage devices can be interconnected through communication networks.

Some implementations include electronic components for example microprocessors storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine readable or computer readable medium alternatively referred to as computer readable storage media machine readable media or machine readable storage media . Some examples of such computer readable media include RAM ROM read only compact discs CD ROM recordable compact discs CD R rewritable compact discs CD RW read only digital versatile discs e.g. DVD ROM dual layer DVD ROM a variety of recordable rewritable DVDs e.g. DVD RAM DVD RW DVD RW etc. flash memory e.g. SD cards mini SD cards micro SD cards etc. magnetic or solid state hard drives read only and recordable Blu Ray discs ultra density optical discs any other optical or magnetic media and floppy disks. The computer readable media can store a computer program that is executable by at least one processing unit and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code for example is produced by a compiler and files including higher level code that are executed by a computer an electronic component or a microprocessor using an interpreter.

While the above discussion primarily refers to microprocessor or multi core processors that execute software some implementations are performed by one or more integrated circuits for example application specific integrated circuits ASICs or field programmable gate arrays FPGAs . In some implementations such integrated circuits execute instructions that are stored on the circuit itself.
