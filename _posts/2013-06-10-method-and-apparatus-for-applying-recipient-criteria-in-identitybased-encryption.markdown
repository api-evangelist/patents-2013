This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 708 778 filed Feb. 19 2010 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

Service providers e.g. wireless cellular Internet content social network etc. and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by for example providing compelling network services and advancing the underlying technologies. One area of interest has been in ways to facilitate users to share content on the existing networks while maintaining user privacy and confidentiality using encryption. Public key cryptography is a widely used to protect data so that only a specific person or a machine can access the data. However encryption techniques rely upon long and randomly generated keys that typically are mapped to identities using digitally signed certificates. The management of these certificates and the task of fetching a certificate before encryption become daunting as the numbers of users and keys increase. On the other hand users e.g. commercial advertisers non profit fund raisers end users etc. are seeking ways to distribute messages to target recipients without knowing the identities of the target recipients. Consequently service providers and device manufacturers face the challenge of providing sufficient communication and network resources to support anonymous yet targeted encrypted information dissemination.

Therefore there is a need for an approach for applying recipient criteria in identity based encryption.

According to one embodiment a method comprises selecting one or more recipient criteria for data. The method also comprises encrypting the data using the selected one or more recipient criteria as a public key of identity based encryption.

According to another embodiment an apparatus comprising at least one processor and at least one memory including computer program code the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to with the at least one processor cause at least in part the apparatus to select one or more recipient criteria for data. The apparatus is also caused to encrypt the data using the selected one or more recipient criteria as a public key of identity based encryption.

According to another embodiment a computer readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which when executed by one or more processors cause at least in part an apparatus to select one or more recipient criteria for data. The apparatus is also caused to encrypt the data using the selected one or more recipient criteria as a public key of identity based encryption.

According to another embodiment an apparatus comprises means for selecting one or more recipient criteria for data. The apparatus also comprises means for encrypting the data using the selected one or more recipient criteria as a public key of identity based encryption.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

A method and apparatus for applying recipient criteria in identity based encryption are disclosed. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

Identity based encryption IBE is a public key technology. IBE is different from other public key technologies in that IBE keys are calculated with unique information about the identity of the user e.g. a user s email address instead of being generated randomly. Identity based systems allow any party to generate a public key from a known identity value such as an ASCII string or information in any data representation. To operate a trusted third party called the private key generator PKG first publishes a master public key and retains a corresponding master private key. Given the master public key any party can compute a public key corresponding to the identity ID by combining the master public key with the identity value. To obtain a corresponding private key an authorized party contacts the PKG which uses the master private key to generate the private key for the identity ID. Since public keys are derived from identity IDs IBE eliminates the need for a public key distribution infrastructure. This further eliminates the need for a sender and a receiver in an IBE based messaging system to interact with each other before sending secure messages. The authenticity of the public keys is guaranteed as long as the transport of the private keys to the corresponding user is kept secure. IBE encrypted messages can use standard message formats such as the cryptographic message syntax CMS .

As used herein the term decision diagram refers to a compact graphical and or mathematical representation of a decision situation sets or relations. A decision diagram for example may be a binary decision diagram BDD or a reduced ordered binary decision diagram ROBDD . A BDD is ordered if different variables appear in the same order on all paths from the root. A BDD is reduced if any isomorphic subgraphs of its graph are merged and any nodes whose two child nodes are isomorphic are eliminated. Isomorphic subgraphs of the same decision diagram have similar appearance but originate from different sources. A ROBDD is a group of Boolean variables in a specific order and a directed acyclic graph over the variables. A directed acyclic graph DAG contains no cycles. This means that if there is a route from node A to node B then there is no way back. Although the term BDD almost always refers to reduced ordered binary decision diagram ROBDD this application refers to ROBDD separately from BDD to avoid confusion.

A decision diagram may be used to organize any data including one or more recipient criteria into a tree type data structure that permits identification of a result by traversing various branches of the structure. Although various embodiments are described with respect to applying recipient criteria it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other data that can be organized into a tree type data structure. The term AugBDD refers to an augmented ROBDD which is augmented information including the ROBDD and at least one of a header with a hash identifier hash ID a construction history of the ROBDD keyed hash IDs and cardinality information e.g. relationships between data tables constraints on the types and number of class instances a property may connect with respect to a given ontology etc. . Each ROBDD is given a hash ID by operating a hash function over its ROBDD graph structure. Ideally the hash function would never produce the same hash ID for two different ROBDDs.

As used herein the term construction history information of a hash identifier of interest includes at least one or more other hash identifiers corresponding to a respective one or more other decision diagrams used to construct a decision diagram corresponding to the hash identifier of interest. The construction history also includes identification of one or more Boolean operators applied to the other hash identifiers listed in history. Since the ROBDD may be constructed by BDD operations from other ROBDDs a succinct representation of the ROBDD including the construction history of the ROBDD and a hash ID can be sent instead of the ROBDD to reduce data traffic. In one embodiment plain hash IDs form the basis for the communication. A keyed hash ID may be added in the communication along with a key ID. This allows the recipient to ensure that the keyed hash ID can be created from the corresponding graph or the plain hash ID by using the produced key. To create a keyed hash ID the data of the ROBDD is serialized to be input into a keyed hash function such as HMAC SHA1 HMAC SHA 256 etc. The keyed hash function allows entities to share the same secret key and to independently ensure that the resulting hash IDs were created by an entity having the secret key. Key IDs may correspond to different groups such as different social networks. A key ID together with an ROBDD graph constitute proof that the ROBDD has been constructed by the owner of the key ID.

The system of addresses this problem with a solution of applying recipient criteria C e.g. user personality feature such as age gender personal interest etc. technical capability of receiving device such as digital rights management compliance device usage patterns environmental conditions in which the device is used context information associated with the device such as location time day other predetermined conditions or a combination thereof as an encryption key on the secret data D in identity based encryption. In this case the trusted third party only needs to keep a database about half of the size as the above discussed database. Since the encryption key is the recipient criteria the database only needs to keep the recipient criteria and then calculate a decryption key based upon the recipient criteria when necessary.

In one embodiment all participants of the system obtain an IBE master public key MK and domain parameters DP from a private key generator PKG . This occurs once for example at the time of manufacturing the UE that are later used by the participants and does not need to occur again. The system uses IBE master public key MK domain parameters DP and the recipient criteria C to encrypt the secret data D through an IBE description function E D ibe encrypt MK DP C and publishes the encrypted data E D for example at an information store.

By way of example any party who meets the recipient criteria can choose a criteria C contact the PKG with C to obtain a decryption key and then use the description key to decrypt the published encrypted secret data D into decrypted data D through an IBE decryption function D ibe decrypt E D DK DP . The decryption key can be used to decrypt any information that has been encrypted using the same criteria as an encryption key. The party either has some foreknowledge of the C or opportunistically offers the C to the PKG to see if the party can decrypt the published encrypted secret data.

In another embodiment the information store stores the published encrypted secret data E D in association with the criteria C such as by tagging E D with C thereby controlling different kinds of access to C. For example the information store maintains the association between E D and C while making C invisible to the party.

After verifying that the party meets the recipient criteria the PKG sends the party a decryption key for decrypting the encrypted secret data. However as the use of encryption keys for maintaining user privacy grows the size of the database can increase significantly. The system of improves the solution by representing the recipient criteria in an information representation format or structure e.g. a RDF graph using the RDF graph as a public key to encrypt the secret data and publishing the encrypted data. The PKG then verifies authorized parties as discussed above e.g. verifies that the authorized parties meet the recipient criteria . To simplify the discussion RDF graphs are used as one example of representation of the recipient criteria. In one embodiment RDF graphs represent decision diagrams and describe resources with classes properties and values. A node resource is any object which can be pointed to by a uniform resource identifier URI properties are attributes of the node and values can be either atomic values for the attribute or other nodes. RDF Schema provides a framework to describe application specific classes and properties. Classes in RDF Schema are like classes in object oriented programming languages. This allows resources to be defined as instances of classes and subclasses of classes.

The RDF graphs are represented or encoded in decision diagrams which describe the properties and relations of different classes. A class has a name and potentially several associated properties and it may be a subclass of another class. Possible properties are represented as arcs from one class node to other class nodes. These property arcs can be properties of the object which have values that are the nodes targeted by the property arcs .

Each RDF graph includes a set of unique triples in a form of subject predicate and object which allow expressing graphs. For example in this piece of information Dave Stewart is a musician the subject may be Dave Stewart the predicate may be is and the object may be musician. The simplest RDF graph is a single triple. Any node or entity can store unconnected graphs. As later explained in more detail the approach described herein can be adapted in a smart space that includes the semantic web and has distributed nodes and entities that communicate RDF graphs e.g. via a blackboard or a shared memory .

To further reduce the size of the recipient criterion representation the system uses for instance a subset of the RDF graph to represent the recipient criteria. By way of example a compact representation of the RDF graph in the form of a reduced ordered binary decision diagram ROBDD is used as a subset of the RDF graph. In another embodiment instead of the ROBDD an augmented ROBDD AugBDD including a hash identifier is employed to further reduce the size of recipient criterion representation. As the size of the recipient criterion representation is further reduced the storage required for the recipient criterion representation is also reduced. More specifically the system provides for hash tables listing known or existing RDF graphs along with their corresponding respective ROBDDs hash identifiers and other related information. A user may then consult one of the hash tables to obtain a corresponding decision diagram with a hash identifier.

One consideration for selecting the RDF graph encoding scheme is that the encoding scheme should generate a hash identifier for a decision diagram with a reasonably small size while maintaining uniqueness of the hash identifier such that any two decision diagrams will not have identical hash identifiers. For example upon receiving a search query the system serializes the decision diagram into variables and then feeds the variables into a hash function thereby obtaining unique hash identifiers corresponding to the decision diagram. In addition the system can truncate the hash identifiers to a specific bit size while maintaining their uniqueness thereby saving communication resources e.g. reducing network bandwidth while transmitting the same information.

In other words to address the problem of the traditional public encryption systems a system of introduces the capability to apply recipient criteria in identity based encryption. The RDF graphs of recipient criteria are encoded to decision diagrams to be communicated between the nodes e.g. the UE and entities e.g. the platforms etc. . To further reduce communication traffic the system encodes e.g. hashes the decision diagrams of the recipient criteria into hash IDs and avoids sending decision diagrams of the recipient criteria by sending the hash IDs and optionally a construction history of the decision diagrams . The reduced ordered binary decision diagram ROBDD is used as an efficient representation for a binary decision diagram representing the recipient criteria and hashed with a hash function into a hash identifier hash ID .

As shown in the system comprises a user equipment UE having connectivity to a personal computer a web service platform and a communication platform via a communication network . Each of the UE the personal computer the web service platform and the communication platform has a recipient criterion application and a database for storing hash identifier and decision diagram information. By way of example the communication network of system includes one or more networks such as a data network not shown a wireless network not shown a telephony network not shown or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN a public data network e.g. the Internet short range wireless network or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network e.g. a proprietary cable or fiber optic network and the like or any combination thereof. In addition the wireless network may be for example a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi wireless LAN WLAN Bluetooth Internet Protocol IP data casting satellite mobile ad hoc network MANET and the like or any combination thereof.

The UE is any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer Personal Digital Assistants PDAs audio video player digital camera camcorder positioning device television receiver radio broadcast receiver electronic book device game device or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. .

By way of example the UE the personal computer the web service platform and the communication platform communicate with each other and other components of the communication network using well known new or still developing protocols. In this context a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node from generating and receiving physical signals of various types to selecting a link for transferring those signals to the format of information indicated by those signals to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Reference Model.

Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises 1 header information associated with a particular protocol and 2 payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols the packet includes 3 trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet its destination the length of the payload and other properties used by the protocol. Often the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks such as the Internet typically include a physical layer 1 header a data link layer 2 header an internetwork layer 3 header and a transport layer 4 header and various application headers layer 5 layer 6 and layer 7 as defined by the OSI Reference Model.

In this embodiment the recipient criterion application includes a control logic for controlling the operation of the recipient criterion application and a constructing module for constructing a RDF graph from one or more recipient criteria a ROBDD from the RDF graph a hash identifier of the ROBDD and a keyed hash identifier of the ROBDD. The constructing module also constructs a RDF graph from secret data a ROBDD from the RDF graph a hash identifier of the ROBDD and a keyed hash identifier of the ROBDD. The recipient criterion application also includes an encryption decryption module for encrypting the secret data using one of the ROBDD hash identifier or keyed hash identifier of the recipient criteria as a public key and decrypting the encrypted secret data with a decryption key. The recipient criterion application further includes a publishing module for publishing the encrypted secret data. The recipient criterion applications have the same or similar features of the recipient criterion application

In many circumstances a user may want to share information with just people of like mind and or same hobbies e.g. people meeting certain recipient criteria . In other words the user may only want to reach out people meeting these criteria without knowing their actual identification. In this scenario the recipient criterion application can encrypt the information to be shared e.g. the secret data using the recipient criteria itself e.g. an age range and music preferences as a public key of identity based encryption step . An example process used in the approach of system is described in more detail with respect to below.

In a process the node has an option to send to an information store a message including the recipient criteria together with a header. For example the message can be an email SMS EMS MMS etc. and the header can describe or otherwise specify the recipient criteria. When the recipient criteria are sent in a message without a header the information store or any intended recipient can read the recipient criteria transmitted through a logically separate message. The separate message makes the recipient criteria visible i.e. not being encrypted. On the other hand if the recipient criteria are not described in the header or transmitted through the separate message the intended recipient that meets the specified criteria and or has a corresponding decryption key given by the information store cannot determine whether to decrypt the published encrypted secret data C before trying to decrypt C.

When the message is sent with a header containing the recipient criteria the information store can take action based upon the header without reading the message body. Further if the information store makes the header available for everyone the intended recipient can determine whether to decrypt C before trying to decrypt C. It is noted that under some conditions although non intended recipients e.g. as other nodes may have no key to open up or decrypt the published encrypted secret data the non intended recipients may nonetheless use the recipient criteria described in the header to generate other encrypted secret data e.g. spam etc. targeted at the group of intended recipients. When the node is concerned about such spam attacks or other unwanted information resulting from the recipient criteria described in the header the node can still include the header in the message while requesting that information store not to publish the recipient criteria.

Information on IBE standard parameters is available in Network Working Group RFC5091 Identity Based Cryptography Standard IBCS 1 Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems by Boyen et al. December 2007 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference. By way of example the following system parameters are set to be compatible with Type 1 Curve implementation see section 4.4.2 of RFC5091 under the Boneh Franklin scheme which is an IBE scheme 2001 well known in the art. It is noted that this system can be adapted to optimal and efficient IBE schemes other than the Boneh Franklin scheme. In one embodiment a setup algorithm is run by the PKG one time for creating the whole IBE environment and specifying the IBE scheme to be used. In one scheme a master private key is kept secret and used to derive users private keys. The system parameters are made public. In one embodiment communicating parties e.g. the PKG the node the information store the recipients etc. share common system domain parameters consisting of 

1. A curve equation e.g. y 2 x 3 1 mod p . Notation means exponentiation for example 3 2 9. This curve is super singular elliptic curve defined over prime field modulus p.

2. A prime number p such that p 11 is divisible by 12. Table 1 shows an example of a 160 bit prime number p.

6. A domain specific common public key Pub that is a point x y of the curve y 2 x 3 1 Pub s G where s is master key. For example the Pub can be computed from a master secret S. Since s is not part of domain parameters revealing Pub does not reveal the s. Table 4 shows examples of a master secret S pubx and puby of a common public key point Pub on the curve.

It is described on page 57 of RFC5091 that the security levels of the system can be achieved with certain parameter sizes. RSA which stands for Rivest Shamir and Adleman who first publicly described it is an algorithm for public key cryptography and is widely used in electronic commerce protocols. Typically 1024 bit RSA corresponds to 80 bit of security. This security level can be achieved with a 512 bit p and a 160 bit q. 2048 bit RSA is recommended nowadays and it corresponds to 112 bit security. This security level can be achieved with a 1024 bit p and a 224 bit q.

The RDF graph includes an instance 0.times.12 D is a e.g. an RDF process Musician e.g. an RDF node and has a name e.g. an RDF process of Dave Stewart e.g. an RDF node . To simplify the discussion there are only two vertices extending from instance 0.times.12 D and there is no subtree below the RDF node Musician or the RDF node Dave Stewart. However it is contemplated that there can be any number of vertices and or subtrees below any of the RDF nodes e.g. nodes or of the RDF graph to represent the information of age between 18 24 and fans of Dave Stewart etc. as part of recipient criterion RDF. is a diagram of a more complicated RDF graph according to one embodiment. is a diagram of a reduced ordered binary decision diagram corresponding to the RDF graph of according to one embodiment.

Returning to process of the recipient criterion application constructs the ROBDD of from the RDF graph of representing the recipient criteria Step . In particular the recipient criterion application serializes the RDF graph into variables of a predetermined format to construct the ROBDD . There are many ways or conditions for encoding the RDF graph into bit vectors. For instance the bit size can be three as discussed below. Different bit sizes result in for instance different numbers of variables which lead to ROBDD graphs of different sizes and shapes. ROBDD is essentially a group of Boolean variables in a specific order and a directed acyclic graph over the variables. In the example of the recipient criterion application sets five BDD variables representing the subject e.g. the instance 0x12D the predicates e.g. process a and process name and the objects e.g. node Musician and node Dave Stewart . The recipient criterion application then selects a number of bits for representing and encoding the subject the predicates and the objects. Accordingly the recipient criterion application encodes these variables in three bits and saves the encoding information in a dictionary as follows in Table 6 

The recipient criterion application constructs a ROBDD from the variables. With respect to the example of the recipient criterion application uses the encoded variables to create a ROBDD graph consisting of nine one bit variables where the first three variables are interpreted as a variable encoding the first field of the triple the second three variables are interpreted as a variable encoding the second field and the last three variables are interpreted as a variable encoding the third field of the triple. This ROBDD is unique for the chosen triples and variable ordering resulting in representation of the following encoded triples in Table 7 

Thereafter in one embodiment the recipient criterion application encrypts the secret data using the ROBDD of the recipient criteria as the public key as shown in Step of . The recipient criterion application then causes at last in part storage the ROBDD of the recipient criteria Step . Since the ROBDD is smaller than the RDF graph this embodiment provides a means for reducing the storage and network traffic for sending recipient criteria related information.

In another embodiment the recipient criterion application computes a hash identifier corresponding to the ROBDD of the recipient criteria thereby encrypting the secret data using the hash identifier of the recipient criteria as the public key Step . The recipient criterion application then causes at last in part storage of the hash identifier of the recipient criteria Step . Since the hash identifier is shorter than the ROBDD this embodiment provides a means for further reducing the storage and network traffic for sending recipient criteria related information.

To compute the hash identifier of the ROBDD the recipient criterion application selects a hash function for obtaining unique hash identifiers within the system and feeds the representation into the hash function. Like the size of the bit encoding the hash function is usually chosen heuristically or to be adhered to by all users and or components of the system . Optionally the recipient criterion application shortens the computed hash identifier by truncating a result of the hash function while obtaining unique hash identifiers. The recipient criterion application then stores the hash identifier with the ROBDD before publishing the hash identifier of the recipient criteria.

As discussed there are different advantages of sending to the information store the message including the recipient criteria with or without a header describing the recipient criteria. In another embodiment by using a header that contains some derivative of the recipient criteria such as the hash identifier or the keyed hash identifier of the recipient criteria the problem of spam attacks are prevented while the information of the recipient criteria is made available for the information store and or intended recipients. To obtain the ROBDD or the RDF from the hash identifier or the keyed hash identifier the information store and or the intended recipients may compare incoming derivative of the potential recipient criteria with the derivatives in a database to identify the corresponding ROBDD or RDF . Alternatively the information store . Alternatively the intended recipients may reconstruct the ROBDD or RDF via a reverse computation as discussed above in conjunction with the construction history of the ROBDD or RDF in the database. When the derivative of the recipient criteria is a keyed hash identifier the key used to encrypt the hash identifier is identified by the key ID and then used to decrypt the keyed hash identifier.

In one embedment the recipient criterion application encrypts the ROBDD of the secret data using either the recipient criteria the RDF of the recipient criteria or the ROBDD of the recipient criteria as the public key Step . The recipient criterion application causes at least in part publication of the encrypted ROBDD of the secret data via the information store or any databases in the semantic web Step .

In another embodiment the recipient criterion application computes a hash identifier corresponding to the ROBDD of the secret data thereby encrypting the hash identifier of the secret data using either the recipient criteria the RDF of the recipient criteria or the hash identifier of the recipient criteria as the public key Step . The recipient criterion application then causes at least in part publication of the encrypted hash identifier of the secret data Step .

Optionally the encrypted hash identifier of the secret data can be further encrypted with a key following a process similar to for creating a keyed hash identifier of the secret data to provide one additional layer of protection. The encrypted ROBDD hash identifier or keyed hash identifier of the secret data can be published in the semantic web with the hash identifier or keyed hash identifier of the recipient criteria that is used to encrypt the encrypted decision diagram hash identifier or keyed hash identifier of the secret data. The above discussed sets of keys key IDs and the encrypted targets can be stored at the PKG node the information store for marching the corroding ROBDDs or RDF graphs without transmitting them over the communication network. In addition if these entities also store the construction histories of the ROBDDs or RDF graphs they can reconstruct a ROBDD or RDF graph locally based on a hash identifier or a keyed hash identifier when the ROBDD or RDF graph is not stored locally.

The recipient criterion application within Matti s phone constructs a RDF graph containing the recipient criteria and converts the RDF graph into a ROBDD during an operation . The recipient criterion application also computes a hash identifier for the ROBDD via AugBDD id C ID AugBDD c during an operation . Matti sets his secret data to include for example a Dave Stewart fan club account number and fan club postal office mail box for fans to denote money to buy two albums Sweet Dreams and One of the boys or to directly denote the two albums. The secret data optionally contains the fan club account name and password assigned by a service provider. By way of example Matti sets the secret data which Matti wants to share with people who can demonstrate to fulfill the recipient criteria as follows in Table 9 

The recipient criterion application then converts the secret data into a ROBDD generates a hash identifier via S ID AugBDD s . A set of IBE common domain parameters e.g. common pars as discussed is obtained from a centralized source. The recipient criterion application encrypts the secret data using the hash identifier as a public key via Msg IBE crypt common pars C ID S ID . The recipient criterion application publishes in the cloud the hash identifier and a packet message containing the encrypted secret data in a format of E hash id data during an operation . The term cloud is used as a metaphor for the Internet based on the cloud drawing used to depict the Internet in computer network diagrams as an abstraction of the underlying infrastructure it represents to provide services of processing power storage software or other computing services. Typically these services are rented by a service provider.

Instead of the cloud the recipient criterion application inserts the hash identifier of the recipient criteria and the packet into a smart space discussed later as common data via Insert Matti SP IBE content msg C ID .

When Jenna an 18 years old female indicates via her phone that she wants to download one or more songs of Dave Stewart from an information store in the cloud the recipient criterion application within Jenna s phone updates Jenna s old ROBDD into a ROBDD with information of the downloaded songs and coverts the new ROBDD into a hash identifier during an operation . The recipient criterion application then sends the hash identifier to the cloud during an operation .

An information store in the cloud matches Jenna s new ROBDD with the ROBDD corresponding to the Matti s hash identifier of the recipient criteria and then notifies a PKG during an operation . The PKG then finds the private decryption key corresponding to Matti s hash identifier of the recipient criteria and sends the decryption key to Jenna during an operation .

The recipient criterion application within Jenna s phone then can use the decryption key to decrypt the packet message containing the encrypted secret data during an operation .

Before decrypting the packet Jenna s recipient criterion application checks the header of the packet for the recipient criteria to determine if it is something that might interest her. For example the determination can be made automatically based upon Jenna s preference data stored in the phone or made by displaying the recipient criteria to Jenna to prompt her to indicate her interest. If the header contains a hash identifier of the recipient criteria the recipient criterion application searches locally for a matched ROBDD then determine based upon the ROBDD. The social network has friendship relations and public information of its participants. These relations and information are formed into RDF graphs which can be constructed as AugBDDs and published at a central location or any information store in the cloud . The AugBDDs may contain history information of its construction. An ROBDD encoding dictionary database may be available for all participants. If necessary the dictionary is transmitted along with the ROBDDs or the AugBDDs.

If there is no matched ROBDD stored locally the recipient criterion application can reconstruct the ROBDD based upon the construction history of the ROBDD or ask for the ROBDD from the information store . If the header contains a keyed hash identifier of the recipient criteria the recipient criterion application finds the key used to encrypt the hash identifier of the recipient criteria either locally or from the information store decrypts the keyed hash identifier with the key and then proceeds to find the corresponding ROBDD of the recipient criteria as discussed.

Optionally the cloud enforces configuration validity check between a node e.g. Jenna s phone and the PKG during an operation . For example the cloud checks the hash identifier of Jenna s ROBDD and the privacy key to ensure that their configurations are within acceptable or predetermined ranges.

The above described embodiments advantageously enhance outreaching and marketing efforts by providing an anonymous yet tailored messaging mechanism thereby reducing network resources e.g. computing resources bandwidth etc. that would otherwise be required to individually identify potential recipients of the marketing efforts. The above described embodiments also can be used by non profit as well as for profit entities to distribute any access restricted information without knowing or specifying the identification of the recipients. By way of example a natural disaster may potentially create orphans. A non profit organization can then use the system to send out messaging worldwide that is specifically targeted to solicit only those prospective adoptive parents that are forty five or younger married for at least two years and have no more than two previous marriages per spouse without children or with children older than five etc.

As another example companies that set goals to use make and sell green products services in all aspects of their business operations can use green recipient criteria to solicit for purchasing green products services in order to manufacture green products or provide green services. By setting up the green recipient criteria such as energy efficiency reduced environmental impact or ecological preservation the companies can pre screen suppliers service providers e.g. building maintenance contractors business consultants financial advisors doctors lawyers tutors etc. customers e.g. top 50 dental product manufacturers in China tenants etc. employees etc. with the required qualification and experience.

By encrypting the recipient criteria the sender of the message keeps the confidentiality of the recipient criteria. By way of example a pharmaceutical company wants to test the efficacy of Omalizumab an approved drug for treating asthma in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis recurrent hypersensitive allergic episodes for which a cause is not identified . The pharmaceutical company encrypts the eligibility criteria for medicine trial volunteers so that their competitors have no access to such commercially valuable information. The eligibility criteria may include age between 18 and 60 years having been diagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis episodes mild to severe at least six times per year at least once within the last 2 months and emergency room visit etc. The pharmaceutical company can also encrypt the recruiting criteria for clinical trial investigators and keep the clinical trial confidential since an earlier stage.

In another example a marketing company encrypting the recipient criteria to look for participants of a focus group for a target such as an existing or new product service concept advertisement idea packaging price etc. in order to find out the participants perceptions opinions beliefs and attitudes towards the target. The above described embodiments provide a means to keep the target and recipient criteria information confidential.

Besides commercial studies the above described embodiments can be used for non profit studies such as social sciences and urban planning to allow interviewers to study by interviewing and observing behaviors of people in a group or one on one setting online teleconferencing in person etc. and discover unexpected issues for exploration. The above described embodiments provide means for the message sender to conduct outreach to specific recipients without knowing their identities which not only saves the sender s resources time and money to research assemble purchase a tailored mailing list but also encourages the public to participate in projects since the participants can remain anonymous.

The conventional participant recruiting scheme requires the sender to publicly post the recruiting criteria on media such as newspaper sender s own website job websites professional association websites clinical trial matching website etc. For example the US patent office sends out a general recruiting letter to all registered patent attorneys and agents to invite them to apply for a job as a patent examiner. If applying the above described embodiments the patent office can reach out to any target recipients with specified or predetermined education technical training industrial experience in special technology that is a much big group than the group of registered patent practitioners and indicating specific job descriptions e.g. a US citizen or national PhD in pharmacology etc. in each message that a particular recipient is actually qualified for. Such a customized marketing mechanism significantly reduces the number of messages thus reducing the network traffic and extending equipment lifetime. Such a customized marketing means also spares non qualified recipients from receiving messages they cannot act upon.

The system can be used in an information cloud a semantic web or a smart space architecture to be available in all locations to all nodes and entities. The goal of the semantic web is to define the meaning semantics of information and services on the web to be understandable and satisfying the web content searches by people and machines. As information on the Web grows search engines routinely return thousands of results when very often only a handful truly qualify as meaningful for the query presented. The smart space truly achieves the goals of the semantic web and supports interpretability across different service provider software and hardware platforms user equipment databases etc.

As used herein a smart space is interoperable over different information domains different service platforms and different devices and equipment. For example the smart space accommodates transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP Unified Protocol UniPro created by the Mobile Industry Processor Interface MIPI Alliance Bluetooth protocol Radio Frequency Communication RFCOMM IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks 6LoWPAN etc. The smart space also covers technologies used for discovering and using services such as Bluetooth human interface device HID services web services services certified by the Digital Living Network Alliance DLNA the Network on Terminal Architecture NoTA . In addition the smart space constitutes an infrastructure that enables scalable producer consumer transactions for information and supports multiparts multidevices and multivendors M3 via a common representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts i.e. ontologies. The smart space as a logical architecture has no dependencies on any network architecture but it can be implemented on top of practically any connectivity solution. Since there is no specific service level architecture the smart space has no limitation in physical distance or transport.

The smart space allows cross domain searches and provides a uniform use case independent service application programming interface API for sharing information. As an example the smart space allows a mobile platform to access contextual information in e.g. a car home office football stadium etc. in a uniform way and to improve the user experience without compromising real time requirements of the embedded system. The smart space uses an ontology governance process as the alternative to using case specific service API standardization. The ontology governance process agrees and adopts new vocabularies using Resource Description framework RDF and RDFS RDF schema . When RDFS is not sufficient for defining and instantiating the ontologies web ontology language OWL or the like is used.

In one embodiment the RDF is used to join data from vocabularies of different domains such as business domains without having to negotiate structural differences between the vocabularies. In addition the RDF allows the smart space to merge the information of the embedded domains with the information in web as well as to make the vast reasoning and ontology theory practice and tools developed by the semantic web community available for developing smart space applications. The smart space is an aggregation of individual smart spaces of private group or public entities and the smart space makes the heterogeneous information in embedded domains available for semantic web tools. The smart space architecture expands the concept of a deductive closure towards a distributed deductive closure. The smart space architecture addresses values in application development by abolishing the need for a prior use case standardization such as those in the Digital Living Network Alliance DLNA domain and the Bluetooth domain. Furthermore the smart space architecture abolishes design time freezing of the address of any used service API such as in the case of WebServices.

The smart space architecture is different from university driven RDF store based approaches in getting information of embedded systems as an integral part of the search extent. The space based approach of the smart space architecture also provides an alternative to surrendering personal data to a search engine or a service provider. The smart space architecture applies to the semantic web an end to end design principle which is widely applied in the Internet since communication media can never know the needs of endpoints as well as the endpoints themselves.

From the perspective of the recipients they do not have to sign up with any commercial professional or social network website in order to receive the above described messages. Any information the recipients ever provide to a public and or private entity in the real world or in the virtual world can be incorporated into the smart space as granted by the recipients participants. The entity can be a real world legal entity or a virtual entity e.g. an avatar . For example the information records include the government records e.g. birth certificates school records driver s licenses tax records real property records criminal records etc. commercial activity records e.g. flight tickets movie tickets CD DVD book purchases restaurant store hospital gym visits car house education loans credit debts phone utility heating bills internet browsing behaviors etc. personal activity records e.g. basketball teams hikes etc. . The system data mines the information records to uncover patterns of the recipients in data either with or without their real world identification. When the system is allowed by the recipients only to data mine without associating the information with their real world identification the system can associate the data mining results with a reference that may be tied to an alias of the recipient such that the system can send messages to the recipient later. The above described embodiments reach the recipients over a secure encrypted mechanism to ensure total confidentiality. The system protect the privacy and confidentiality of the recipients by eliminate the sender s need to know the recipient identification e.g. names email addresses etc. . The system uses the information regarding the messages and the corresponding recipients with authorization of the senders and the recipients.

The devices may be any devices e.g. a mobile terminal a personal computer etc. or equipment e.g. a server a router etc. . By way of example RDF is used in the smart space . The triple governance transactions in the smart space uses a smart space Access Protocol SSAP to e.g. join leave insert remove update query subscribe unsubscribe information e.g. in a unit of a triple . A subscription is a special query that is used to trigger reactions to persistent queries for information. Persistent queries are particular cases of plain queries.

The physical distribution protocol of a smart space i.e. SSAP allows formation of a smart space using multiple SIBs. With transactional operations a node object produces inserts and consumes queries information in the smart space . As distributed SIBs belong to the same smart space query and subscription operations cover the whole information extent of a smart space.

In this embodiment the internal and external AugBDD tables are embedded in the SSAP protocol at SIB IF or ISIB IF upon an insert protocol message. The system builds itself on top of the smart space protocol to uses ontological constructs for processing RDF graphs ROBDDs hash identifiers for the recipient criteria and the secret data. The SIB IF is an interface between the SIBs and a device and the ISIB IF is an interface between two SIBs.

In one embodiment the approach described herein is implemented at the interfaces SIB IF and ISIB IF of the system to transmit the hash IDs and the encrypted secret data packets. In other embodiments one or more application programming interfaces APIs e.g. third party APIs can be used in addition to or instead of SIB IF and ISIB IF. The approach described herein provides performance gains while allowing multiple proprietary implementations of information stores in the smart space according to . The decoding complexity for developing an application is buried below a convenience API CONV API according to . Similarly the tools for a local at the node level information search are provided as a part of a convenience library.

As discussed the augmentation of construction history and other information related to the ROBDD of the recipient criteria and secret data are embedded in the corresponding AugBDDs. In one embodiment the smart space protocol messages are checked for hash ID consistency by 1 checking for the correct according to ontology types of hash IDs in term of a range and a domain of the instances that have a defined property between them and 2 checking for a correct number of hash IDs connected by the defined properties. In other words the 1 and 2 mechanisms are applied to detect the smart space robdd id concept within the smart space messages and then perform the checking for the availability of hash IDs from the external index table. The request for a missing hash ID can then be executed via a smart space query. This query relies upon the ROBDD graphs being available in a SIB in the smart space. The AugBDDs can be sent over to a remote system that uses the AugBDDs locally to check the consistency of the hash IDs or other properties in local information stores which allows checking for ontology conformance without direct access to the ontology description.

One of the problems of sharing information in the semantic web is to share the graphs or parts of the graphs i.e. subgraphs among distributed nodes and entities via information stores with sufficient identification of the graphs especially the subgraphs while minimizing communication traffic. Private smart space allows each entity to set the shared portions of the smart space with different entities.

As described the above described embodiments independently encrypts without collaboration input or creating any direct relationships to the intended recipients. Instead the encryption is based on criteria defining who the recipients might be without specifically identifying the recipients. In addition the above described embodiments do not require maintenance of database including pairs of a decryption key a recipient criterion.

The above described embodiments operating in the smart space allow novel marketing approaches. Taking targeted marketing as an example after outreaching the anonymous recipients the system can use pre existing social networks of the anonymous recipients to produce increases in brand awareness or to achieve other marketing objectives such as product sales . This kind of promotions may take the form of video clips interactive games ebooks brandable software images or even text messages.

The processes described herein for applying recipient criteria in identity based encryption may be advantageously implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

A bus includes one or more parallel conductors of information so that information is transferred quickly among devices coupled to the bus . One or more processors for processing information are coupled with the bus .

A processor performs a set of operations on information as specified by computer program code related to apply recipient criteria in identity based encryption. The computer program code is a set of instructions or statements providing instructions for the operation of the processor and or the computer system to perform specified functions. The code for example may be written in a computer programming language that is compiled into a native instruction set of the processor. The code may also be written directly using the native instruction set e.g. machine language . The set of operations include bringing information in from the bus and placing information on the bus . The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information shifting positions of units of information and combining two or more units of information such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR exclusive OR XOR and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions such as an operation code of one or more digits. A sequence of operations to be executed by the processor such as a sequence of operation codes constitute processor instructions also called computer system instructions or simply computer instructions. Processors may be implemented as mechanical electrical magnetic optical chemical or quantum components among others alone or in combination.

Computer system also includes a memory coupled to bus . The memory such as a random access memory RAM or other dynamic storage device stores information including processor instructions for applying recipient criteria in identity based encryption. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory is also used by the processor to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions. The computer system also includes a read only memory ROM or other static storage device coupled to the bus for storing static information including instructions that is not changed by the computer system . Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Also coupled to bus is a non volatile persistent storage device such as a magnetic disk optical disk or flash card for storing information including instructions that persists even when the computer system is turned off or otherwise loses power.

Information including instructions for applying recipient criteria in identity based encryption is provided to the bus for use by the processor from an external input device such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into physical expression compatible with the measurable phenomenon used to represent information in computer system . Other external devices coupled to bus used primarily for interacting with humans include a display device such as a cathode ray tube CRT or a liquid crystal display LCD or plasma screen or printer for presenting text or images and a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball or cursor direction keys or motion sensor for controlling a position of a small cursor image presented on the display and issuing commands associated with graphical elements presented on the display . In some embodiments for example in embodiments in which the computer system performs all functions automatically without human input one or more of external input device display device and pointing device is omitted.

In the illustrated embodiment special purpose hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC is coupled to bus . The special purpose hardware is configured to perform operations not performed by processor quickly enough for special purposes. Examples of application specific ICs include graphics accelerator cards for generating images for display cryptographic boards for encrypting and decrypting messages sent over a network speech recognition and interfaces to special external devices such as robotic arms and medical scanning equipment that repeatedly perform some complex sequence of operations that are more efficiently implemented in hardware.

Computer system also includes one or more instances of a communications interface coupled to bus . Communication interface provides a one way or two way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors such as printers scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link that is connected to a local network to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example communication interface may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus USB port on a personal computer. In some embodiments communications interface is an integrated services digital network ISDN card or a digital subscriber line DSL card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments a communication interface is a cable modem that converts signals on bus into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example communications interface may be a local area network LAN card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links the communications interface sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical acoustic or electromagnetic signals including infrared and optical signals that carry information streams such as digital data. For example in wireless handheld devices such as mobile telephones like cell phones the communications interface includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments the communications interface enables connection to the communication network for applying recipient criteria in identity based encryption.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing information to processor including instructions for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to computer readable storage medium e.g. non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non transitory media such as non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as storage device . Volatile media include for example dynamic memory . Transmission media include for example coaxial cables copper wire fiber optic cables and carrier waves that travel through space without wires or cables such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves including radio optical and infrared waves.

The term computer readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer readable medium except transmission media.

Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer readable storage media and special purpose hardware such as ASIC .

Network link typically provides information communication using transmission media through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer or to equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider ISP . ISP equipment in turn provides data communication services through the public world wide packet switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet .

A computer called a server host connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example server host hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display . It is contemplated that the components of system can be deployed in various configurations within other computer systems e.g. host and server .

At least some embodiments of the invention are related to the use of computer system for implementing some or all of the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention those techniques are performed by computer system in response to processor executing one or more sequences of one or more processor instructions contained in memory . Such instructions also called computer instructions software and program code may be read into memory from another computer readable medium such as storage device or network link . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory causes processor to perform one or more of the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments hardware such as ASIC may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software unless otherwise explicitly stated herein.

The signals transmitted over network link and other networks through communications interface carry information to and from computer system . Computer system can send and receive information including program code through the networks among others through network link and communications interface . In an example using the Internet a server host transmits program code for a particular application requested by a message sent from computer through Internet ISP equipment local network and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor as it is received or may be stored in memory or in storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution or both. In this manner computer system may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor for execution. For example instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus carries the information to memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by the processor .

In one embodiment the chip set includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a general purposed processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA not shown one or more controllers not shown or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to apply recipient criteria in identity based encryption. The memory also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.

Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit MCU a Digital Signal Processor DSP and a receiver transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of applying recipient criteria in identity based encryption. The display includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal e.g. mobile telephone . Additionally the display and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry includes a microphone and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone is fed to a coder decoder CODEC .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile terminal speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In one embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU not shown .

The MCU receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard and or the MCU in combination with other user input components e.g. the microphone comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal to apply recipient criteria in identity based encryption. The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .

The CODEC includes the ADC and DAC . The memory stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via e.g. the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory flash memory registers or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device may be but not limited to a single memory CD DVD ROM RAM EEPROM optical storage or any other non volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.

An optionally incorporated SIM card carries for instance important information such as the cellular phone number the carrier supplying service subscription details and security information. The SIM card serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal on a radio network. The card also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry text messages and user specific mobile terminal settings.

While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements which fall within the purview of the appended claims. Although features of the invention are expressed in certain combinations among the claims it is contemplated that these features can be arranged in any combination and order.
