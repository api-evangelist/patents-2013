This invention was developed under contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

An integrated circuit may be composed of a plurality of semiconductor devices such as transistors or the like which can be produced by a variety of techniques. To facilitate increased integration and speed of semiconductor devices a geometrical progression of continuously scaling semiconductor devices e.g. decreasing transistor size increasing transistor areal density etc. has emerged. Reducing the size of a semiconductor device and or a feature size of a semiconductor device can provide improved speed performance density cost per unit etc. of resultant integrated circuits. However as the size of semiconductor devices and device features have been reduced conventional fabrication techniques e.g. lithography are being challenged in their ability to produce modules comprising a plurality of integrated circuits located with high proximity to each other. For example fin field effect transistors fin FET are being manufactured with a 22 nanometer gate which is a few 10s of atoms across. Hence the limits of lateral scaling of devices and their manufacture are being reached. Accordingly the Semiconductor Industry Association has recognized the limits of conventional planar manufacture of semiconductor devices and accordingly has identified three dimensional integrated circuit 3D IC fabrication as a core enabler in keeping pace with Moore s Law.

For example while a fin FET is topographically a 3D structure conventional manufacture of a fin FET is by way of a standard planar process flow. However it is not possible to extend the planar process flow repetitively in the vertical dimension to capture 3D volumetric scaling of transistor density and construction of a 3D structure is severely hampered when limited to 2D viewing and processing.

It could be opined that current CMOS having 7 10 layers of metallization are 3D however these structures can be viewed as the result of a succession of strictly 2D operations. In addition the phrase 3D IC is used in the semiconductor industry and literature to describe a subset of devices typically formed by stacking successive functional 2D planar die and making use of through wafer vias or through silicon vias or by bonding die in a face to face manner. In both forms the plane containing the transistors and interconnects for each level is parallel to the wafer surface.

Hence to enable 3D IC fabrication where the functional semiconductor devices are fabricated on surfaces which are not parallel to the wafer surface to be realized new approaches to semiconductor device manufacture have to be engendered. 3D fabrication is an approach to extending effective areal density but current methods e.g. nano origami direct laser write etc. of 3D fabrication at the sub micron scale are rare typically not CMOS compatible require non standard equipment and lack high volume manufacturing scalability.

The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.

It is not intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Various technologies pertaining to manufacture of 3D structures are now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident however that such aspect s may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.

Further the term or is intended to mean an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or . That is unless specified otherwise or clear from the context the phrase X employs A or B is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is the phrase X employs A or B is satisfied by any of the following instances X employs A X employs B or X employs both A and B.

Additionally as used herein the term exemplary is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something and is not intended to indicate a preference.

As noted above exemplary embodiments presented herein relate to formation of 3D structures e.g. IC s at both the device level and the system level. The exemplary embodiments presented herein further relate to application of these 3D structures to hybrid technologies such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS photonic and CMOS biological applications as well as other applicable structures such as diodes MOS capacitors bipolar transistors photovoltaics memory storage devices etc. Further in an example the various embodiments presented herein relate to membrane projection lithography MPL a microfabrication technique where directional deposition through a suspended patterned membrane can be utilized to create micron scale 3D structures for example. The fabrication approach can also include such techniques as patterned etching and patterned ion implantation combined with blanket processes such as oxidation CVD deposition and planarization.

To facilitate understanding of the various embodiments presented herein is a block diagram of various stages involved in an implantation e.g. ion implantation operation utilizing MPL technology. The stages presented can be further extended to etching and material deposition as further described herein. For the purpose of illustration the various embodiments presented herein are described with respect to a single unit cell of a matrix material where the matrix material can effectively act as a substrate in more than one dimension. However the various embodiments are applicable to fabrication of arrays of unit cells using standard semiconductor processing equipment and materials as will be apparent from the description that follows particularly and . The choice of the matrix material can depend on the desired electromagnetic performance structural and processing characteristics for example a silicon containing material which can be in a monocrystalline form as well as a polycrystalline form depending upon the final device application as well as other semiconductors such as gallium arsenide and germanium and dielectrics such as silica and silicon dioxide. Further the matrix material can include a non electrical material such that a 3D structure can be formed thereon and the underlying matrix material is not involved with operation of the 3D structure. At step a cavity is formed in each unit cell of the matrix material . The cavity can be formed by any suitable technique such as etching a void into a block of matrix material or by depositing the bottom and side walls of matrix material to form the cavity e.g. lithographically etc. . At step a sacrificial backfill material can be deposited into the cavity and planarized to support a subsequent membrane layer . The sacrificial backfill material can later be selectively removed using any suitable technique such as by an etching or dissolution mechanism whereby the suitable technique can be a material selective technique configured to not affect any of the membrane the matrix material or other materials included in structures formed on the cavity wall s . Exemplary sacrificial backfill materials include silicon Si silicon dioxide SiO polyimide photoresist etc. At step the membrane layer is deposited on the planarized backfill material . Exemplary membrane materials include photoresists Si SiO silicon nitride SiN metals and nitrides or other compounds of metals such as aluminum chromium and titanium for example thus including by way of example AlN CrN TiN etc. The membrane layer material can be subsequently removed with a selective etchant or be chemically mechanically polished CMP off. Alternatively a release layer can be deposited prior to formation of the membrane layer to enable subsequent lift off of the membrane. At step the membrane layer can be patterned e.g. with standard lithographic techniques e.g. e beam stepper scanner interferometric lithography nano imprint lithography screen printing contact mask exposure shadow mask etc. to provide a mask opening that images the desired structure e.g. a patterned cross in this example . One significant advantage to this approach is that the membrane is polished flat prior to patterning so extremely shallow depth of focus lithography systems such as modern steppers can still be used to create the requisite patterns. At step the sacrificial backfill material can then be removed through the mask opening to provide a cavity underneath the suspended patterned membrane layer .

A region or structure can be formed by an implantation operation on a wall of the cavity using consecutive off normal and or normal implantation of a material e.g. an ion beam through the mask opening . The implantation operation and also the etching and deposition operations presented herein can be conducted under vacuum e.g. high vacuum such that the implanted material region and similarly the etched and deposited structures accurately replicates the membrane pattern. For example at step a first directional implantation of material can be made with an implantation source tilted at 45 away from the mask normal N e.g. at 45 into the plane of the figure thereby implanting material e.g. ions in a first region on the inside of the front wall of the cavity . The top of the membrane layer can also be coated with implantation material. In a deposition operation any build up of material deposited onto the membrane layer can be removed prior to a next deposition being performed with the membrane layer to prevent occlusion of the opening .

At step further implantations can be made with the implantation source tilted at 45 away from the mask normal N and spread out 90 azimuthally from the first implantation in the plane of thereby forming a second implanted region on another interior side wall of the cavity . Two additional off normal implantations and a normally aligned implantation results in three additional regions and being formed on the interior side back and bottom walls of the cavity . At the membrane layer can be removed e.g. by selective etching of the membrane layer or by lift off of release layer to provide a unit cell comprising a plurality of implanted regions formed on the inner walls of the exposed cavity .

It is to be appreciated that while the various embodiments illustrated herein depict a cavity having a cubic profile structure the embodiments are not so limited and the cavity can be formed to any desired shape such as curved cylindrical spherical ellipsoidal prismatoidal conic etc.

As mentioned the exemplary technique presented in can be extended to be applicable to both a deposition operation s and an etching operation s . illustrate the respective operations of deposition implantation and etching being undertaken with the MPL technique according to one or more embodiments. illustrates a cell having walls with a membrane layer formed thereon. Membrane layer has a pattern formed therein e.g. by lithography which forms the basis for the shape of the deposited structure . Structure is formed based on a volume of deposition material which passes through pattern to be deposited on an inner surface of cell wall . Deposition can be conducted under vacuum e.g. a high vacuum deposition operation such as e beam evaporation or physical vapor deposition PVD such that the deposited structure accurately replicates the membrane pattern. illustrates an implantation technique e.g. ion implantation and can effectively be considered the structure formed in step

At C an implantation process can be conducted whereby a stream of implanting material e.g. an ionized beam can be directed onto an interior wall surface of cell via the opening to facilitate implantation of an n well structure . Subsequent to and also subsequent to G and I while not shown but as presented in the membrane layer and also subsequently formed respective layers and can be removed the cavity reopened and refilled with a sacrificial backfill material e.g. material and the backfill material planarized to support a subsequent membrane layer e.g. respective layers and being formed thereon.

At D a membrane layer can be formed over the backfill material as previously discussed and one or more openings can be formed in the membrane layer whereby the opening s can have a shape of a pair of P type metal oxide semiconductor PMOS source drain implant structures. At E an implantation process can be conducted whereby a stream s of implanting material e.g. an ionized beam can be directed on to the interior wall surface of cell via the opening s to facilitate implantation of the PMOS source drain implant structures . Membrane can be removed and at F a membrane layer can be formed over the backfill material as previously discussed and one or more openings can be formed in the membrane layer whereby the opening s can have a shape of a pair of N type metal oxide semiconductor NMOS source drain implant structures.

At G an implantation process can be conducted whereby a stream s of implanting material can be directed on to the interior wall surface of cell via the opening s to facilitate implantation of the NMOS source drain implant structures . Membrane can be removed and at H an oxide layer can be deposited grown on the interior wall surface of cell whereby in an embodiment the oxide layer can be formed over the respective PMOS source drain implant structures and the NMOS source drain implant structures .

At I a membrane layer can be formed over the backfill material as previously discussed and one or more openings can be formed in the membrane layer whereby the opening s can have a shape of the pair of NMOS source drain implant structures and the PMOS source drain implant structures . An etching process can be conducted whereby a stream s of etchant can be directed via the one or more opening s to facilitate removal of a portion of the oxide layer to expose the underlying pair of NMOS source drain implant structures and the PMOS source drain implant structures .

At J a membrane layer can be formed over backfill material as previously discussed and one or more openings can be formed in the membrane layer whereby the opening s can have a shape of the various interconnects utilized to couple the pair of NMOS source drain implant structures and the PMOS source drain implant structures as required e.g. to form a transistor structure. At K a deposition process can be conducted whereby a stream s of depositing material e.g. as required to form the interconnects such as Al Cu or other conductor can be directed on to the interior wall surface of cell via the opening s to facilitate formation of the interconnects .

At L membrane can be removed with the desired structure formed on the interior wall surface of cell e.g. comprising of a pair of NMOS source drain implant structures the PMOS source drain implant structures an n well structure an oxide layer and interconnects . As illustrated in a plurality of structures can be formed at each respective stage e.g. E G H I and K to facilitate formation of a transistor structure on each of the one or more interior walls e.g. any of the interior right side wall the interior left side wall the interior front wall the interior back wall and the bottom wall of the cavity e.g. as represented by unit cell comprising a plurality of structures implanted on the inner walls of the exposed cavity depicted in .

It is to be appreciated that while the foregoing embodiments relate a sequence of operations whereby a first membrane is formed patterned and then removed the first membrane can remain and a second membrane formed over the first membrane. Hence formation of the second membrane may cover or fill any existing openings formed in the first membrane whereby patterning of the second membrane can also form an opening in the first membrane. After any of the implantation deposition or the etching processes are conducted to form the desired structure on the interior wall s the second membrane and first membrane can be jointly removed.

However as shown in by constructing semiconductor components in a 3D arrangement reverse engineering the resulting IC can be much harder than reverse engineering a conventionally fabricated IC. For example component comprises of a transistor structure where the gate structure and the source drain structure have been formed on a vertical wall . Hence in the exemplary structures presented in where at least one structure e.g. structure can be formed vertically on any of the side walls as well as in the base of the cell structure to reverse engineer an IC fabricated in accordance with the various embodiments presented herein can be complicated. For example as indicated in the depth to which a CMP operation occurs can be very hard to determine as a feature e.g. a gate source drain interconnect via etc. may be completely removed during the CMP operation e.g. a CMP slice without an operator knowing. Also a focused ion beam FIB operation can be utilized to gain further understanding of the structure of component e.g. by milling material away from a component. However the FIB operation may be undertaken in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the CMP operation which can further obfuscate knowledge of a construction of component . For example material is being removed in the vertical direction by a CMP process while the FIB operation is removing material in the horizontal plane of . Hence it is difficult to ascertain how much material is being removed and where such material is being removed from by the respective CMP and FIB operations.

Further as illustrated in when two or more cell surfaces e.g. surfaces and are aligned to each other with approximate orthogonality uncertainty regarding feature removal is heightened. In addition the uncertainty regarding various features e.g. gate structures drain structures being removed during each stage of a CMP operation can be further exacerbated by a FIB operation being undertaken in at least one direction orthogonal to the CMP operation. At the system level a 3D IC can be inherently more difficult to reverse engineer than a conventional planar structure as not only the individual device structure but the interconnection topology can be distributed in all three dimensions. Hence even if the individual device structure can be resolved creating a 3D map of the logic flow can be more difficult than with a 2D planar device. Thus by utilizing the various embodiments herein advantage can be taken of an IC that can be constructed that can require a complicated reverse engineering process es to facilitate understanding of the structure of the IC.

Interconnects and can be formed as a result of forming vias in a backfill material . In the previous embodiments presented herein the backfill material can be utilized to support formation of a membrane material e.g. membrane whereupon once the membrane material has been formed and an opening e.g. opening formed in the membrane material the backfill material is removed through the opening. In the alternative embodiment presented in rather than removing the backfill material to form cavity openings such as via openings and can be extended into the backfill material as shown in which is a section across Y Y of . The via openings can be formed by a sequence of operations including forming a membrane forming an opening in the membrane forming the via and removal of the membrane . Hence for example the via openings and can be formed from a single opening with via opening being formed at an angle while via opening is formed vertically. Further a second opening can be formed to facilitate formation of via opening .

The via openings and can be subsequently filled with material such as a conductor as shown in . Furthermore connector can be formed on the surface of the backfill material whereby connector can extend from the matrix material to connect with the interconnect formed in the via opening .

As shown in and the backfill material and the membrane can be removed to leave interconnects and formed in the cavity space with interconnect connected to connector which extends over the cavity . With the approach presented in as illustrated it is possible to form interconnects in 3D space e.g. in cavity which can enable local routing of interconnects in the unit cell volume. In a conventional 2D approach the ability to place form interconnects between transistors etc. is limited to routing connections through higher and higher levels of metal. Application of 3D diagonal interconnects have at best limited application in a conventional 2D IC structure but with the 3D approach presented herein an excavated volume of a cavity can be utilized as an interconnect space rather than being limited to the exposed surface of an active silicon layer with a 2D approach.

Further as illustrated in while the previous embodiments have related to the formation of 3D structures in a cavity e.g. cavity 3D structures can also be formed on the surfaces of fins pillars etc. For example fins and pillars can be formed from matrix material on respective substrates and . Hence rather than forming cavities e.g. cavity in a matrix material fins can be formed by building up the fin material or patterning a matrix material to form the fins. Similarly pillars can be formed by building them with matrix material or patterning the matrix material. A series of operations can be performed comprising of filling the trenches and between the respective fins and pillars with backfill material e.g. backfill material forming a membrane thereover e.g. membrane layer forming an opening e.g. opening in the membrane and subsequently forming the desired structure s where the series of operations can be repeated as necessary to facilitate formation of a final required structure. On the surface of the fins gate structures and drain structures can be formed while on the exterior surfaces of the pillars structures and can be formed. It is to be appreciated that while the various embodiments illustrated herein depict pillars having a cubic profile structure the embodiments are not so limited and the pillar can be formed to any desired shape such as curved cylindrical spherical ellipsoidal prismatoidal conic etc. Similarly while the fins are shown having a rectangular profile structure other shaped fins can be equally formed.

Based on the foregoing it is to be appreciated that the various embodiments presented herein can be extended such that unit cells can be formed comprising of any of a cavity a fin or a pillar with required 3D structures and interconnects formed thereon. Furthermore the possible device materials can include deposited polycrystalline silicon. For example in the field of thin film transistors TFT a layer of polycrystalline silicon can be deposited on a structural substrate which may not be electrically useful for example a polymer a glass etc. and transistors can then be subsequently formed in the polycrystalline silicon layer. Transistors formed with polycrystalline silicon can have inferior performance to those transistors formed with single crystal monocrystalline silicon but a requirement to form the transistors on a semiconductor substrate can be negated. Hence by utilizing the various embodiments presented herein it is possible to deposit a first layer of polysilicon form a first layer of transistors or other active devices deposit a second layer of polysilicon over the first layer of transistors form a second layer of transistors on the second layer of polysilicon deposit a third layer of polysilicon etc. to facilitate formation of a 3D volume of 3D devices.

At a base structure can be formed. For example a transistor structure can comprise of Si or other suitable material to act as a 3D substrate e.g. a matrix material onto which desired structures e.g. a gate a source a drain interconnect metal line etc. can be formed. As previously described a cellular structure can be formed whereby a cavity can be formed in each unit cell of the substrate material. The cavity can either be formed by any suitable technique such as by etching the cavity deposition of bottom and side walls to form a cavity e.g. via lithographically or otherwise etc.

At a sacrificial backfill material can be deposited into the cavity and further planarized to support membrane layer to be subsequently formed thereon. The sacrificial backfill material can be later selectively removed using any suitable technique such as an etching or dissolution mechanism whereby the suitable technique is a material selective technique configured to not affect either the membrane or the substrate material comprising the cavity walls and base.

At a membrane layer can be deposited on the planarized backfill material. The membrane layer material can be later removed with a selective etchant. A release layer can be deposited prior to deposition of the membrane layer on the planarized backfill material to enable subsequent removal lift off of the membrane.

At the membrane layer can be patterned e.g. with standard lithographic techniques to provide an opening in the membrane layer where the opening in conjunction with the remaining membrane mask acts as a mask. The opening can be formed such that it images the desired structure e.g. a gate a drain a source an interconnect etc. to be subsequently formed on at least one of the cavity sidewalls and or the bottom surface of the cavity.

At the sacrificial backfill material can be removed through the opening to facilitate reformation of the cavity underneath the patterned membrane layer.

At at least one of a material deposition operation an implantation operation and or a material removal operation e.g. an etching operation can be performed as required to form the required structure. For example the opening in the membrane can be of a dimension shape required as a mask and hence form the required structure such as an implanted n well an implanted NMOS source drain a PMOS source drain a deposited oxide layer a hole etched in a layer a deposition to form an interconnect etc. as described herein. As mentioned by adjusting the position of a source e.g. an ion implantation beam relative to the opening and an underlying surface e.g. any of the cavity sidewalls the bottom surface of the cavity etc. more than one structure can be formed for a single instance of a membrane layer.

At once the required structure s have been formed by any of deposition implantation etching etc. the membrane layer can be removed.

At a determination can be made regarding whether the final overall structure has been achieved e.g. the structure depicted in any of structure etc. . In the event of a further structure s is to be formed e.g. by any of deposition implantation etching etc. the methodology can return to whereby the cavity can be refilled with backfill material a new membrane layer formed thereon and patterned in accord with the next required structure to be formed etc.

At in the event of at the final structure has been achieved the final membrane layer can be removed and subsequent processing of the transistor can be undertaken as required.

Each component can include any necessary apparatus material s processor and or control logic to facilitate generation of a beam of material required to facilitate formation of one or more structures on the wall s of cavity . Further system can include a processor in association with a data store . Processor can control operation of one or more components of the system to facilitate formation of the one or more structures on the wall s of cavity . For example processor can control lithographic component to facilitate formation of an opening in the membrane layer whereby the processor can further control the position of support structure to enable correct placement of the membrane relative to a lithographic operation being conducted on beam alignment . In a subsequent operation e.g. any of a deposition operation an etching operation an implantation operation processor can control respective operation of components and also placement of the cell matrix material membrane . Operating instructions such as required positioning for a sequence of structure forming operations can be stored in data store for retrieval by processor .

Referring now to a high level illustration of an exemplary computing device that can be used in accordance with the systems and methodologies disclosed herein is illustrated. For instance the computing device may be used to control a 3D manufacturing operation comprising one or more components comprising system e.g. processor etc. The computing device includes at least one processor that executes instructions that are stored in a memory .

For instance the input interface may be used to receive instructions from an external computer device from a user etc. The computing device also includes an output interface that interfaces the computing device with one or more external devices. For example the computing device may display text images etc. by way of the output interface .

Additionally while illustrated as a single system it is to be understood that the computing device may be a distributed system. Thus for instance several devices may be in communication by way of a network connection and may collectively perform tasks described as being performed by the computing device .

As used herein the terms component and system are intended to encompass computer readable data storage that is configured with computer executable instructions that cause certain functionality to be performed when executed by a processor. The computer executable instructions may include a routine a function or the like. It is also to be understood that a component or system may be localized on a single device or distributed across several devices.

Various functions described herein can be implemented in hardware software or any combination thereof. If implemented in software the functions can be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer readable medium. Computer readable media includes computer readable storage media. A computer readable storage media can be any available storage media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example and not limitation such computer readable storage media can comprise RAM ROM EEPROM CD ROM or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Disk and disc as used herein include compact disc CD laser disc optical disc digital versatile disc DVD floppy disk and blu ray disc BD where disks usually reproduce data magnetically and discs usually reproduce data optically with lasers. Further a propagated signal is not included within the scope of computer readable storage media. Computer readable media also includes communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A connection for instance can be a communication medium. For example if the software is transmitted from a website server or other remote source using a coaxial cable fiber optic cable twisted pair digital subscriber line DSL or wireless technologies such as infrared radio and microwave then the coaxial cable fiber optic cable twisted pair DSL or wireless technologies such as infrared radio and microwave are included in the definition of communication medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.

In view of the foregoing description a 3D manufacturing is presented which can provide any of the following benefits an increased transistor density for a given area compared with a conventional 2D plane operation. For example rather than a transistor being formed on the bottom layer of a cell an equivalent structure to a 2D plane structure further transistors can be formed on any of the four sidewalls of the cavity such than the 3D manufacturing approach described herein can facilitate formation of two three four or five transistors in an area of about the same planar dimension as a transistor formed with the conventional 2D approach. Further the various embodiments presented herein are CMOS compatible and hence can make use of current standard CMOS processing equipment. Furthermore all lithographic patterning occurs on a planar substrate e.g. the membrane layer and hence depth of focus issues which plague conventional lithography are negated. And further as previously described a 3D IC is likely more difficult to reverse engineer because the formed structure circuitry is distributed in a volume rather than a plane thereby thwarting a polish analyze method of attack.

Throughout the description the term substrate is indicated to be the base layer upon which the various subsequent layers nFET and pFET resists gate structures channels etc. are formed. The substrate can comprise of any suitable material such as Si Si compound etc. which can be subsequently doped to form respective nFET and pFET regions etc.

The various layers presented in the foregoing can be formed deposited by any suitable process such as a thermal processing phase conversion spin coating deposition CVD process for example low pressure chemical vapor deposition LPCVD plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD molecular beam epitaxy MBE liquid phase epitaxy LPE vapor phase epitaxy VPE solid phase epitaxy SPE deposition doping etc.

Any suitable technique can be used to pattern any of the material layers presented herein e.g. to form a nFET gate a pFET gate etc. . For example patterning can be created by employing for example a photoresist which can be patterned using standard photolithographic techniques to form the required pattern in the membrane layer to create the gate source drain interconnects etc. wherein the photoresist is exposed to electromagnetic radiation through a mask having an image pattern of a desired layout e.g. desired trenches openings line patterning etc. . Openings are then formed in the photoresist and subsequently the membrane layer in order to form the desired layout e.g. by etching away the exposed material in the case of a positive photoresist or etching away the unexposed material in the case of a negative photoresist . Depending on the material of the photoresist exposure can create a positive or a negative. With a positive photoresist exposure causes a chemical change in the photoresist such that the portions of the photoresist layer exposed to light become soluble in a developer. With a negative photoresist the chemical change induced by exposure renders the exposed portions of the photoresist layer insoluble to the developer. After exposure and development an opening according to the desired pattern is formed in the membrane layer. A subsequent processing step such as a deposition step an etching step an ion implantation step etc. can be performed and controlled according to the opening. The photoresist can be subsequently removed. Etching can be by any viable dry or wet etching technique. For example a wet or dry etching technique can be employed for patterning while in another aspect etching can be by a specific anisotropic etch.

Any etching material removal technique is applicable to the various embodiments as described herein. Wet etching can be utilized to remove a particular layer e.g. the backfill material where a given layer may be susceptible to etch by a particular etchant while a neighboring layer is not e.g. selective etching utilized to remove the backfill material leaves the cell material intact . In another example anisotropic etching techniques can be utilized to control material removal in a specific direction.

Levelling of layers after formation can be by any suitable technique e.g. by CMP or other suitable process to achieve a given dimension in preparation for the next stage in creation of the 3D structure.

Stripping of a resist layer e.g. any of membrane layers or involves the removal of unwanted resist from the 3D structure while preventing removal of underlying layers and materials. Any suitable stripper can be utilized as required such as organic stripper inorganic stripper dry stripping etc. In another example chemical mechanical polishing or other physical removal process can be used to remove the membrane.
