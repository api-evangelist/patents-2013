title: Method and system for automatically identifying voice tags through user operation
abstract: A method for automatically identifying voice tags on an electronic device. After failure to initiate a communication using a voice input command, the user may then subsequently contact the recipient using an application program of the electronic device. The original audio of the voice input command may be identified as a potential voice tag for the now-identified recipient. The method includes: receiving, through a voice interface program, a voice input command, the voice input command including a command element and a content element; ending the voice interface program without performing the voice input command; receiving, through an application program, a user input which identifies data for executing an application program command; performing the application program command; and identifying audio of the content element as a voice tag associated with the data identified by the user input.

Voice recognition engines are used to translate spoken words into text in order to execute desired user commands. Example voice recognition applications include voice dialling call routing home appliance control in vehicle applications search data entry preparation of structured documents and speech to text processing e.g. word processors or emails .

With new laws banning driving and handling of electronic devices using voice activated dialling e.g. over a Bluetooth headset has become more common. End user experience is shaped by the ability of the voice recognition engine to accurately resolve the commands and the contact referenced. A major challenge of voice recognition engines is dealing with phonetic variations associated with names input in different origin languages and end user accents. The detection accuracy problem is further amplified when the audio path is extended for example going through the Bluetooth headset microphone instead of the resident microphone of the handheld phone.

Some conventional voice recognition engines are trained merely by having the user read a known paragraph at setup time.

Additional difficulties with some existing systems may be appreciated in view of the detailed description below.

Some conventional voice recognition engines give the user the option to record a voice tag when adding a new contact. For example the end user is prompted to record a voice tag for that specific contact. Subsequent voice dialling attempts compare a voice input request to the voice tags on record. This process may be cumbersome for some users since it increases the number of steps involved in creating a contact. Also this voice tag does not simulate how the voice input would be used in actual operation conditions of the device for example when used in a vehicle car airplane or factory setting.

In some example embodiments there is provided a method for automatically identifying voice tags through user operation of an electronic device the electronic device having access to data records such as contact records. For example after failure to initiate a communication using a voice input command the user may then subsequently contact the recipient using an application program of the electronic device. The original audio of the voice input command may be automatically identified as a potential voice tag for the now identified recipient. The voice tag can then be saved to the device if desired.

In accordance with an example embodiment there is provided a method for automatically identifying voice tags on an electronic device configured to execute at least a voice interface program and an application program the method including receiving through the voice interface program a voice input command the voice input command including a command element and a content element ending the voice interface program without performing the voice input command receiving through the application program a user input which identifies data for executing an application program command performing the application program command and identifying audio of the content element as a voice tag associated with the data identified by the user input.

In accordance with an example embodiment there is provided an electronic device which includes a processor configured to execute at least a voice interface program and an application program memory coupled to the processor an input interface including an audio input interface and an output interface. The processor is further configured to receive through the voice interface program a voice input command the voice input command including a command element and a content element end the voice interface program without performing the voice input command receive through the application program a user input which identifies data for executing an application program command perform the application program command and identify audio of the content element as a voice tag associated with the data identified by the user input.

In accordance with an example embodiment there is provided a non transitory computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon which when executed by a processor on an electronic device configured to execute at least a voice interface program and an application program causes the electronic device to receive through the voice interface program a voice input command the voice input command including a command element and a content element end the voice interface program without performing the voice input command receive through the application program a user input which identifies data for executing an application program command perform the application program command and identify audio of the content element as a voice tag associated with the data identified by the user input.

Reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system comprises a number of mobile communication devices mobile devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless communication network which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSDPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be required . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email messages to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email messaging server and optionally other servers . The other servers may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile communication devices in the wireless network an application server for implementing server based applications such as instant messaging IM applications or a web server for providing content accessible by a web browser.

For the purposes of the described example embodiments any server within an enterprise network such as a messaging server or any other server will be referred to as an enterprise server. A service may include one or more servers or enterprise servers.

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

Encryption keys used for communications or for encrypting data stored on the device can be protected via various means such as a password or hardware based protections such as those afforded by hardware based key stored mechanisms.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server or other servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or other servers to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server or other servers .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

A mobile device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer such as desktop or notebook computer via the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device and computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared IR connection such as an Infrared Data Association IrDA connection a short range radio frequency RF connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth special interest group or IEEE 802.15.3a also referred to as UltraWideband UWB or other PAN connection.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the example embodiments.

Reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a mobile device in which example embodiments can be applied. The mobile device is a two way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device in various embodiments the mobile device may be a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant or tablet enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem such as a computer system within a vehicle.

The mobile device includes a case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the mobile device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone .

The mobile device may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input device and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.

The mobile device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed.

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules comprise operating system software data and software applications which for example may include a platform API one or more non voice applications and a voice command application . The voice command application may include speech recognition module a platform module a task module and a user module . The software applications may further include a web browser not shown a file manager application not shown one or more messaging applications such as a text or instant messaging application and an email messaging application and an address book application . Such applications may or may not already be voice enabled. In some example embodiments the functions performed by each of the applications may each be realized as a plurality of independent elements and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications . The data may include at least messaging address information and telephone address information . In some example embodiments one or more applications are configured to receive data such as files documents or other information from a server such as a messaging server or another server . Non limiting examples of data received from a server may include email attachments files transferred via file transfer protocol FTP or any other protocol documents or files downloaded from a web page via a web browser or files sent via a text or instant messaging application.

In some examples the software applications may be implemented using a number of services which define the communication protocols used to communicate between an external server and an application on the communication device. Some applications may only connect to a single type of server using the same communication protocol settings and will therefore only operate using a single service while other applications may connect to a variety of servers using different communication protocols and will require multiple services. For example a banking application on a communication device may only require a single service defining the communication protocol for securely communicating with the bank s online banking server while a web browser may require many different services such as services for general web page browsing for secure web page browsing for streaming video for accessing corporate web email for accessing social media applications or websites or for accessing online public email services.

The software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

In some embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational tool input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some embodiments the mobile device includes a removable memory card typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . The mobile device can store data on the removable memory card in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory or on both a removable memory card and in an erasable persistent memory.

In some embodiments the mobile device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the mobile device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

The mobile device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices. In another example the short range communication subsystem may communicate with an external device having a microphone and or a speaker not shown to aid in the hands free operation of the mobile device .

The mobile device also may include image sensor configured to generate digital image data. The image sensor may include a conventional optical sensor for capturing digitized image data or may be some other digital imaging device. The image sensor operates by capturing visual data from the environment using photosensitive electronic elements and transmitting or storing this data as digital image data using other components of the mobile device . The image sensor may be for example a camera or a charge coupled device CCD .

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information. Similarly audio signal input and audio signal output may be accomplished through an audio input interface and an audio output interface respectively. The audio input interface may be the microphone but may also be the short range communication subsystem which may receive an audio input from the external device . Similarly the audio output interface may be the speaker but may also be the short range communication subsystem which may communicate an audio output to the external device .

Referring again to the software applications of the mobile device can include a platform API of a platform class that is configured to permit applications such as voice enabled applications to register with the platform API . As well the platform API is configured to receive events and pertinent information from non voice applications which becomes voice enabled through operation the voice command application . These may include applications that are native or resident on the mobile device and also may include applications developed by third party developers or external applications. Third party applications may include applications downloaded to the mobile device through an external network. The platform API is further configured to permit communication between the registered voice enabled applications including the voice command application and the non voice applications .

The voice command application configures the processor to implement a speech recognition module a platform module a task module and a user module . The speech recognition module is configured to receive audio data gathered by the microphone and where this audio data comprises a voice input the module may translate the voice input into text corresponding to the content of the voice input. The speech recognition module may perform this translation according to any of a number of conventional speech recognition algorithms. The platform module is configured to initiate the registration of the voice command application with the platform API enabling the voice command application to receive information from the platform class regarding both voice enabled applications and non voice applications . The user module is configured to produce a voice prompt to the user and to issue the voice prompt to the user via the speaker . Collectively the user module and the speech recognition module can implement voice interface programs or voice interface sessions with the user through back and forth communications with the user.

The platform module of the voice command application is configured to register the voice command application with the platform API . Consequently the voice command application is identified as a registered listener of the platform API and this enables the voice command application to receive from the platform API events and additional information regarding voice enabled applications and the non voice application .

The speech recognition module of the voice command application recognizes a voice input and receives a voice input via the microphone of the mobile device . The activation of the voice command application triggers the microphone to be activated and monitoring for a voice input from a user. As well the microphone may be activated by other triggers to monitor for a voice input.

The speech recognition module of the voice command application extracts from the voice input one or more elements. The speech recognition module parses the voice input into one or more discrete elements that may define a voice command or a particular input for one of the user interface objects. The speech recognition module may further translate the voice input received by the microphone into text or another form intelligible to the mobile device according to any of a number of conventional speech recognition algorithms as understood in the art.

Referring again to the address book application provides a user interface for managing contact information . The address book application is configured to allow users to view add delete and or modify contact information associated with one or more contacts. The address book application and the email messaging application may in various embodiments be integrated with and or provided by the operating system stand alone applications or integrated into a single messaging application which provides the functionality of both the messaging application and the address book application .

The mobile communication device stores data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . The data includes service data and user application data. The service data comprises information required by the mobile communication device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The user application data may include such as email messages not shown calendar and schedule information not shown notepad documents not shown and image files not shown .

The user application data stored in the memory also includes the contact information associated with a plurality of contacts. The contact information may be for individuals and or businesses such as persons or businesses associated with one or more users of the mobile communication device . The contacts may also be categorized according to these individual and businesses categories. Individuals or businesses may also be saved as part of a group. The contact information includes one or more contact addresses comprising messaging addresses . Each messaging address specifies an address such as an email address or a telephone number which may be used by the contact for receiving electronic messages. The contact information may be stored in a contact information database sometimes referred to as an address book database or merely address book contact list or contacts . Each contact in the contact information may have a contact record in the contact information database which is accessible by the address book application . In some embodiments the contact information may be stored in a remote contact information database in addition to or instead of the memory . The remote contact information database is typically stored and managed by the messaging server but could be stored and managed by another network component such as the wireless connector system . Some or all of the contact information particular to the user could be synchronized between the local and remote contact information databases depending on the embodiment. In addition the user application data including contact information may be synchronized with a user s host computer in whole or in part in some embodiments.

It will be appreciated that in some embodiments the contact information may include various categories or types of messaging addresses . For example the messaging address may be categorized as an email address a telephone number associated with SMS messaging an instant messaging address or a unique identifier such as a personal identification number PIN which is associated with a specific mobile communication device or user.

A messaging address is an address for use in sending an electronic message of a given type. The messaging addresses could be but not limited to a mobile telephone number for a mobile telephone capable of receiving SMS and or MMS messages an email address an instant messaging IM identifier or address for an IM network a user or device identifier such as a PIN for sending device to device messages also referred to as peer to peer messages or PIN messages an identifier within a private or proprietary communication system or network such as Facebook MySpace or Blackberry Groups or a SIP URI session initiation protocol uniform resource identifier for a Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP network. Contact identifiers could include predetermined types of identifying information which are not messaging addresses including but not limited to identifying information for a Blog Really Simple Syndication RSS feed identifying information or a landline telephone number for a telephone on a public switched telephone network PSTN .

Referring now to an example contact record with which example embodiments can be applied will now be described. The contact record shown in illustrates the data structure of a contact record rather than a user interface representation of the contact record . The GUI of a mobile communication device may display a contact record differently from that shown in and may display more or less than the illustrated fields.

The contact record includes a plurality of fields including a first name field which may be used for storing a contact s given name a last name field which may be used for storing a contact s surname a business name field which may be used to store the name of a company associated with the contact a title field which may be used to store the contact s job title a nickname field which may be used to store a nickname for the contact such as an abbreviated form of the contact s given name a mailing address field which may be used to store a postal address associated with the contact a web page field which may be used to store the address of a web page associated with the contact and a telephone number field which may be used to store a telephone number. Additional telephone number fields may be provided for example one or more for work home mobile session initiation protocol SIP address etc. One of the telephone number fields may be indicated as a default telephone number to be called for each particular contact record .

The contact record also includes one or more messaging address fields which may be used to store one or more messaging addresses which may be used to send an electronic message to the contact. For example the messaging address field may include one or more of the telephone number field wherein the telephone number is associated with the contact and through which the contact may receive an SMS text message or MMS message an instant messaging field which may be used to store an instant messaging address associated with the contact an email address field which may be used to store an email address associated with the contact and or a unique identifier field which may be used to store a unique identifier for sending device to device messages also referred to as peer to peer messages or PIN messages . The unique identifier is different from the telephone number of the mobile communication device and typically has a proprietary addressing format which may vary depending on the embodiment. One of the messaging addresses may be indicated as a default messaging address for each particular contact record .

As will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art device to device messages require software support on the mobile communication device . Accordingly not all mobile communication devices have the software required for message addressing using non telephonic unique identifiers. Thus it is possible that at least some of a user s contacts do not have a unique identifier. In such cases device to device messages cannot be sent to such contacts and the unique identifier field of the corresponding contact record will be empty and possibly hidden depending on the GUI settings of the device .

The unique identifier stored in the unique identifier field uniquely identifies a mobile communication device . The unique identifier may be but is not limited to a personal identification number PIN which is associated with a communication device associated with a contact the contact or both. The PIN may be numeric or alphanumeric. In some embodiments the PIN is assigned to the contact s mobile communication device during its manufacturing. The PIN functions as an address for communicating with the contact s mobile communication device. That is messages sent to a PIN will be received at the contact s mobile communication device associated with that PIN. The PINs of the mobile communication devices are not published as may occur with telephone numbers. Typically a PIN must be shared between users. Accordingly contacts having a mobile communication device which supports PIN addressing but have not shared their PINS will have a corresponding contact record with an empty unique identifier field which may be hidden depending on the GUI settings of the device .

Device to device messages are sent using a carrier s wireless network infrastructure without interacting with the wireless connector system as with email messages and other electronic messages. Depending on the architecture if the carrier s wireless network infrastructure does not support PIN addressing a third party relay service which supports PIN addressing may be required. The relay service provides routing services and stores routing information required to route device to device messages from a sending device to one or more receiving device s using the carrier s wireless network infrastructure. The routing information comprises address mappings of device PINs or other unique identifiers to another form of device address supported by the carrier s wireless network infrastructure including but not limited to IP addresses of the mobile communication devices.

As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art device to device messages and unique identifiers associated with recipient electronic devices used for addressing PIN messages are typically stored on the mobile communication device in the personal address book database and not stored in the global address book database of the wireless connector system or synchronized with a user s host computer . Accordingly PIN based filtering is typically only possible on a supported mobile communication device . In some embodiments PINs may be stored by the messaging server for the supported mobile communication devices but not stored in the global address book database of the wireless connector system or synchronized with a user s host computer . However it is possible that in other embodiments PINs are stored in the global address book database of the wireless connector system and synchronized with a user s host computer .

It will be appreciated that the contact record may include more or less information than that described above with reference to . In some cases some types of the contact information specified above may contain multiple entries. For example a contact may have more than one email address. It will also be appreciated that each field of the contact record may not be populated for all contacts. That is some of the fields in the contact record may be left intentionally blank for some contacts. For example in the example contact record illustrated in the mailing address field the web page field and instant messaging address field have not been populated.

The contact records in the contact information database may be indexed using one or more of the fields of the contact record . For example in some embodiments the contact records are indexed based on the contents of the first name field . In other embodiments the contact records are indexed based on the last name field .

Referring still to in some example embodiments a particular contact record can be associated with a voice tag . The voice tag is a stored audio recording of the user which is associated with the particular contact record. When a given voice request is made by the user that voice request can be compared to the voice tag to determine that the particular contact record is correctly identified rather than comparing the voice request to text using the speech recognition module . In some example embodiments the voice tag is a spoken full contact name or part contact name of the contact name. For example the part contact name can include some or all of the first name last name business name or nickname etc. For example referring to the example contact record of exemplary voice tags include Bob Robert Mr. Smith Manager of ABC etc. The user may also wish to use a short form name to contact his own home or work using voice tags such as home or work for the user s home or work contact address respectively. Such voice tags can be contrasted with some conventional systems which require the user to read a particular specified passage or paragraph since the voice tags store audio of the exact intonation accent and words as spoken by the user. In some example embodiments an association can be stored with the voice tag indicating a known text equivalent such as all or part of the name fields . In some example embodiments the voice tag is any voice input which is desired to be associated with the contact record .

In some example embodiments the voice tag comprises the name as well as an associated command e.g. the voice tag is call Bob rather than just Bob in association with Bob s telephone address information . This requires additional storage but provides greater accuracy for matching with the exact phrase.

A user can manually input a voice tag when initially creating or editing a particular contact record . Further for example from the address book application the user can play or output any existing voice tag for verification. Further in example embodiments described herein the voice command application can be further configured to dynamically and automatically generate the voice tag based upon particular user operation of the device .

Referring still to for example the voice tag can be a single voice tag associated with the contact record . Reference is now made to which illustrate additional example embodiments wherein the voice tag can include multiple voice tags. For example with reference to in some example embodiments some or all of the name fields can each have a respective stored voice tag . As shown in the voice tag can include a respective tag for at least one or all of the first name last name business name title and nickname . In some example embodiments only one of the voice tags is used for comparison. In other example embodiments if a voice request indicates the first name and last name of the desired user each of the voice tags for first name and last name can be compared to the voice request. Other combinations and sub combinations can be implemented in example embodiments.

Reference is now made to which illustrates another alternate example embodiment of the voice tag . For example another difficulty with accurately identifying the user s voice input is when the audio path is extended e.g. going through a Bluetooth headset microphone or wired headset microphone instead of a resident handheld microphone . To account for any variations including any digital processing or compression of the particular voice input peripheral device a voice tag per voice input peripheral device audio path may be stored. As shown in the voice tag may include a voice tag for each input device for some or all of the contact records shown as voice input for the resident microphone voice input for the microphone of a Bluetooth headset and voice input for the microphone of a wired headset. The voice tag of illustrates a single respective voice tag for each input device while in other example embodiments not shown a voice tag may be stored for each of the name fields . The device can first detect the type of input device being used to input the voice command followed by comparing with those voice tags which are associated with that particular input device if available.

Example methods in accordance with some example embodiments will now be described with reference to . Generally in example embodiments there is provided a method for automatically generating voice tags through user operation of the mobile device . For ease of illustration the described methods in accordance with some example embodiments will presume that only a single voice tag is associated with each contact record with the understanding that multiple voice tags may be used for a contact record in some example embodiments where indicated. For ease of illustration the particular contact address which is to be contacted by the device e.g. telephone number or messaging address can be a default contact address or may be further identified by the user through voice input e.g. home office e mail etc.

Reference is now made to which shows a method for automatically identifying voice tags from the voice command application in accordance with an example embodiment. At event a voice application user interface voice interface program or session is started for example by launching the voice command application . At event the voice command application of the mobile device receives through the audio input interface a voice input command which may include at least a command element and a content element. In some example embodiments the voice input command is for initiating a communication to a desired recipient. The command element may indicate a desired type of communication to be initiated such as a call for telephone call message for an electronic message e mail for an electronic mail message or SMS for a short message service message etc. Other commands are also possible in some example embodiments. The content element may be a name or part of a name which is intended to identify a particular contact record . Other types of content or data records are also possible in some example embodiments. For example the voice input command may further include additional message recipients e.g. additional direct recipient carbon copy or blind carbon copy a message body a subject header or other parts of a message for populating a message being sent. Typically the command elements are limited to short predetermined phrases which are easier to disambiguate than the content elements. For the purposes of some example embodiments it may be presumed that the command element has been correctly identified from the voice input command.

At event the voice command application attempts to execute the desired operation of the received voice input command for example by identifying an appropriate application program associated with the command element and using or populating the application program with the content element. Upon successful execution of the voice input command e.g. successfully initiating the communication a new potential voice tag is identified generated at event . In other words the speech recognition module has correctly disambiguated or matched the content element to the correct contact record . For example at event the original received audio of the content element of the voice input command at event can now be saved in memory as the voice tag for the now identified contact record . At event if the voice command application fails at event the voice interface program of the voice command application therefore ends without performing the requested command element. For example this may be because the content element could not be used to properly identify the desired contact record or the variances in user s intonation accent and or words could not be correctly resolved or because the user manually ends the voice interface program or session due to improper identification of the contact record or e.g. ended out of general user frustration after multiple back and forth communications with the voice interface program.

The user may then attempt to perform the same desired function using another application program. At event through a user interface of an application program a user input command containing input content is received to execute an application program command. The input content can be for example used to identify the desired data such as the contact record . For example the user has decided to no longer use the voice command application for example due the failure of the voice command application to properly identify the correct contact record and the user may then decide to subsequently dial the desired contact directly e.g. keyboard typing into the contact name or by scrolling to the desired contact through the address book application . The user input command can therefore comprises one or more separate user inputs for example the selection or typing in of the desired contact followed by the command for initiation of the communication such as selecting send to initiate a telephone or message communication. At event based on the user input command the application program command can be executed by the particular application program of the device . The method may end at this stage if the application program fails e.g. the user prematurely ends the execution of the application program. At event upon successful execution of the application program command a new voice tag can be identified. For example the original received audio of the content element of the failed voice input command at event is identified as a potential voice tag for the now identified data e.g. contact record . After identification at event the option to create a voice tag can be presented to the user for confirmation. Upon user confirmation at event the voice tag is saved in memory for the identified data contact record . In some example embodiments if the application program command is not successfully executed e.g. manually terminated no associated contact record or otherwise fails then no voice tag is generated.

Referring again to event with reference to in order to start the voice interface program in some example embodiments the activation of the voice command application triggers the microphone to be activated and monitoring for a voice input from a user. As well the microphone may be activated by other triggers to monitor for a voice input. Other embodiments include specified audio trigger words to turn on the voice interface program.

In referring again to event in some example embodiments the particular audio input interface or audio input device can be determined. If available referring to the respective voice tag can be searched based on the type of input device used to enter the particular voice input command. The respective voice tag can be voice input for the resident microphone voice input for the microphone of a Bluetooth headset and voice input for the microphone of a wired headset.

Referring to event in order to attempt to perform the command element this may include attempting to match the received content element with an existing contact record which may include searching text of the contact records or matching with previously stored voice tags if available.

Events and will now be described in greater detail in accordance with some example embodiments. In one aspect the voice command application may find a best match from the content element of the voice input command and start executing the command e.g. dialling the closest found contact record . If the match is correct then the end user will allow the call to proceed and the audio of the content element can be recorded as the voice tag for this contact record for future dialling attempts. If the match is not correct then the end user is likely to terminate the call and either try again to use the voice command application again at which point the method starts again at event or the method proceeds to event wherein the user dials the desired contact directly such as typing in the phone number digits or searching for the contact through the address book application e.g. typing in the contact name or navigating to the desired contact record .

Referring still to events and in another aspect the voice command application may find multiple suggestions from the content element of the voice input command and present those to the user in a contact selection user interface. If one of those contacts is selected by the end user the audio of the content element can be recorded as the voice tag for this contact record for future dialling attempts. If none of the suggested contacts are selected by the end user through the contact selection user interface then the method proceeds to event .

Referring still to events and in another aspect the voice command application may not be able to find any suggested contacts based on the content element of the voice input command. If this is the case then the end user is likely to terminate the call and either try again to use the voice command application again at which point the method starts again at event or the method proceeds to event wherein the user dials the desired contact directly such as typing in the phone number digits or through the address book application .

In some example embodiments the receiving of the user input command through the application program at event is the immediately next user input command which is entered after the ending of the voice interface program at event . Event may be the next user input command which is received within a specified time period for example within five seconds of the ending of the voice interface program at event .

Referring again to event in some example embodiments the application program which receives the user input command is a non voice interface application such as graphical user interface or visual user interface based application. Some example application programs are telephone applications and messaging applications. Such user input can be received through at least one of a keyboard mouse trackball scrollball scrollwheel touch screen touch pad and light pen. Therefore the user may be operating the application program of the mobile device using hand operations in the normal course of operation as a subsequent alternate operation to a failed voice input attempt. For example it would be appreciated that in example embodiments there would be no initial prompting audio or otherwise for specifically requesting user input to create a voice tag. Rather operation is performed by the user through the application program during normal operation to actually perform commands from the application program. It would also be appreciated that the identified voice tag reflects how the user would enter the voice input command in actual operating conditions for example when operating the mobile device in a car airplane or factor setting.

In some example embodiments referring to events and or after a potential voice tag is identified based on the user operation a user prompt may be output to the user to request final confirmation of whether the voice tag is to be stored in memory. In some example embodiments if a voice tag already exists for the contact record the user prompt may default to not overwrite the existing voice tag or in other example embodiments further advise the user that generation of the voice tag would overwrite the existing voice tag. In some example embodiments the voice tag is automatically generated and saved as a background function based on predetermined settings and defaults without any further user prompting.

The next time the user attempts to contact the desired recipient using the voice interface program the user can provide a voice input command. The voice input command can be compared to the voice tag that was generated using the method to determine a suitable match.

In some example embodiments the voice tag is identified and stored as the entire original audio voice input command including the content element and the command element. For example the identified voice tag is call Bob rather than just Bob in association with Bob s telephone address information . This requires additional storage capacity but provides greater accuracy for matching with the exact phrase.

Reference is now made to which shows another method for automatically identifying voice tags from the mobile device in accordance with another example embodiment. At event the voice command application can initialize a respective memory buffer which can temporarily store a command element and a content element. In example embodiments the command element is stored as text or other indicator. In example embodiments the content element is stored as audio from a voice input. In example embodiments only one command element and one content element can be stored in the respective buffer at a time. Initializing the buffers also includes clearing or voiding the buffers if there is content previously contained thereon.

At event the mobile device first executes a home user interface mode for example from the operating system . This can include for example a home interface screen wherein the user can launch or open any number of applications configure preferences and settings etc. The home interface screen can be displayed as a visual user interface on the display . In some example embodiments the home user interface mode may include a voice interface mode wherein voice input commands can be entered or applications including voice enabled applications can be launched using voice commands.

At event a voice application user interface voice interface program or session is started for example by launching the voice command application . At event the voice command application of the mobile device receives through the audio input interface a voice input command which may include at least a command element and a content element. The command element may indicate a desired type of communication to be initiated such as a call for telephone call message for an electronic message e mail for an electronic mail message or SMS for a short message service message etc. Other commands are also possible in some example embodiments. The content element may be a name or part of a name which is intended to identify a particular contact record . Other types of content are also possible in some example embodiments. Typically the command elements are limited to short predetermined phrases which are easier to disambiguate than the content elements. For the purposes of some example embodiments it is presumed that the command element has been correctly identified from the voice input command.

At event the audio of the content element is stored to the buffer. At event the command element is stored to the buffer typically as text or some other indicator rather than audio .

At event the voice command application attempts to execute the desired operation of the received voice input command for example by identifying the appropriate application associated with the command element and using or populating the application with the content element. Upon successful execution of the command element a new voice tag can be identified at event . In other words the speech recognition module has correctly disambiguated or matched the content element to the correct contact record . For example the buffered audio of the content element at event is identified and a final user confirmation may be presented to the user. At event the voice tag can now be saved in memory as the voice tag for the now identified contact record . At event having generated and stored the voice tag the buffers are cleared.

At event if the voice command application fails at event the voice interface program of the voice command application therefore ends without performing the requested command element. For example this may be because the content element could not be used to properly identify the desired contact record or the variances in user s intonation accent and or words could not be correctly resolved or because the user manually ends the voice interface program or session due to improper identification of the contact record or e.g. out of general frustration.

At event if there is no command element stored in the memory buffer the method returns to the home user interface at event . Referring still to event for example when the voice interface program has failed or could not execute the desired voice input command a user may then proceed to open or launch an application program at event . Typically this can be the next function that is operated after failure of the voice interface application. For example the user may wish to manually find the desired contact using the application program.

As an initial check in some example embodiments not shown it can be determined that the command element which was buffered at event is associated with the particular application program that was launched. For example if the original command element was for telephoning and the application program was the user playing a video game then no voice tag would be stored based on the user input. If the application program is not associated with the command element buffered at event then the buffers are cleared and the method returns to the home user interface at event . On the other hand if the original command element was for telephoning and the potential voice tag was generated through operation of a phone application then the method continues to event .

In some example embodiments referring to event if a buffer memory contains the command element the method may proceed directly to event to open an application program associated with the command element. For example if the command element is a phone or a message function the application program being automatically started may be an address book application messaging application or phone application as appropriate.

At event through a user interface of the application program a user input command containing input content is received to execute an application program command. The input content can be used to identify the desired contact record . For example the user has decided to no longer use the voice command application for example due the failure of the voice command application to properly identify the correct contact record and the user may then decide to subsequently dial the desired contact directly e.g. using the keyboard or other user input device . At event based on the user input command the application program command can be executed by particular application program of the device . The user input command therefore identifies the desired contact record . At event upon successful execution of the application program command a new voice tag can be identified and saved. At event it is determined whether there is any content element which has been buffered. If so at event the voice tag is identified. For example the buffered audio of the content element at event is identified as the voice tag for the now identified contact record . A user confirmation request can be output to the user and if confirmed by the user the voice tag is saved in memory at event .

As a final check in some example embodiments not shown it can be determined that the command element which was buffered at event is associated with the particular application program. For example if the original command element was for telephoning and the application program was the user playing a video game then no voice tag would be stored based on the user input. On the other hand if the original command element was for telephoning and the potential voice tag was generated through operation of a phone application then the voice tag would be stored. The buffers are then cleared at event .

In some example embodiments at event if the application program command is not successfully executed e.g. manually terminated no associated contact record or otherwise fails then no voice tag is generated. For example the user may accidentally type in the wrong contact field and wish to end the application program. The user may also initially confirm an action such as selecting Send to initiate a telephone or message communication but then manually prematurely end the operation of the application program within a specified time period such as three seconds of the confirming. Upon any of these failures at event the buffers are cleared and the operating mode can once again return to the application program user interface . At this stage the user can operate the application program of the device as normal or exit to return to the home user interface etc. At event if no audio content element has been buffered then the buffers are cleared at event and no voice tag is generated or stored.

Therefore some example embodiments may only consider the immediate next entered user input command through the application program for identifying the potential voice tag. Subsequent user inputs would not be considered for potential voice tags as the buffer have been cleared at event .

In some example embodiments referring to events or after a potential voice tag is identified based on the user operation a user prompt may be output to the user to request final confirmation of whether the voice tag is to be stored in memory. In some example embodiments if a voice tag already exists for the contact record the user prompt may default to not overwriting the existing voice tag or in other example embodiments further advise the user that generation of the voice tag would overwrite the existing voice tag. In some example embodiments the voice tag is automatically generated and saved as a background function based on predetermined settings and defaults without any further user prompting.

The variations described with respect to the method of can be similarly applied to the method of as appropriate and vice versa.

While some example embodiments have been described as being primarily performed by the mobile device it would be appreciated that some steps may be performed a server device not shown for example for resource intensive off site processing. The off site server device may contain a library of aggregate information which can be better equipped to disambiguate received voice inputs.
