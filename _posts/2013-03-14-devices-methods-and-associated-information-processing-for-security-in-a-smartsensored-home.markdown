Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a plurality of devices including intelligent multi sensing network connected devices that communicate with each other and or with a central server or a cloud computing system to provide any of a variety of home security objectives. The subject matter of this patent specification relates to the subject matter of the following commonly assigned application which is incorporated by reference herein U.S. Ser. No. 61 704 437 filed Sep. 21 2012.

Various aspects and possible implementations of providing home security objectives are disclosed herein. Turning to the figures illustrates an example of a smart home environment within which one or more of the devices methods systems services and or computer program products described further herein can be applicable. The depicted smart home environment includes a structure which can include e.g. a house office building garage or mobile home. It will be appreciated that devices can also be integrated into a smart home environment that does not include an entire structure such as an apartment condominium or office space. Further the smart home environment can control and or be coupled to devices outside of the actual structure . Indeed several devices in the smart home environment need not physically be within the structure . For example a device controlling an outdoor lighting system or gated entry system can be located outside of the structure .

The depicted structure includes a plurality of rooms separated at least partly from each other via walls . The walls can include interior walls or exterior walls. Each room can further include a floor and a ceiling . Devices can be mounted on integrated with and or supported by a wall floor or ceiling .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of includes a plurality of devices including intelligent multi sensing network connected devices that can integrate seamlessly with each other and or with a central server or a cloud computing system to provide any of a variety of useful home security and smart home objectives. The smart home environment may include one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected thermostats herein after referred to as smart thermostats one or more intelligent network connected multi sensing hazard detection units herein after referred to as smart hazard detectors and one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected entryway interface devices herein after referred to as smart doorbells . According to embodiments the smart thermostat detects ambient climate characteristics e.g. temperature and or humidity and controls a HVAC system accordingly. The smart hazard detector may detect the presence of a hazardous substance or a substance indicative of a hazardous substance e.g. smoke fire or carbon monoxide . The smart doorbell may control doorbell functionality detect a person s approach to or departure from a location e.g. an outer door and announce a person s approach or departure via audio or visual means.

In some embodiments the smart home environment of further includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected wall switches herein after referred to as smart wall switches along with one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected wall plug interfaces herein after referred to as smart wall plugs . The smart wall switches may detect ambient lighting conditions and control a power and or dim state of one or more lights. In some instances smart wall switches may also control a power state or speed of a fan such as a ceiling fan. The smart wall plugs control supply of power to one or more wall plugs e.g. such that power is not supplied to the plug if nobody is at home . In the illustrated example one of the smart wall plugs controls supply of power to a lamp .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of further includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected entry detectors herein after referred to as smart entry detector . The illustrated smart entry detectors are located at windows doors and other entry points of the smart home environment for detecting when a window door or other entry point is opened broken or otherwise breached. According to embodiments the smart entry detectors may include first and second parts. The first part is attached to a fixed part of the house structure such as the windowsill door sill outer frame side jamb head jamb etc. A second part is attached to part of the window or door that moves when opening and closing such as the upper or lower sash top or bottom rail side stile latch handle etc. The first and second parts of the smart entry detectors are in close proximity when the window or door is closed and the first and second parts move apart from one another when the window or door opens. The smart entry detectors generate a corresponding signal when a window or door is opened or closed etc. It should be appreciated that according to some embodiments the smart entry detectors can be any type of window door entryway alarm sensor known in the art for detecting when a window door or other entry point is opened broken or otherwise breached and that the known alarm sensors become smart when connected to the central server or cloud computing system . According to embodiments the alarm system of the home will not arm unless all smart entry detectors of the home indicate that all doors windows and other entryways are closed and or that all smart entry detectors are armed .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of further includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected doorknobs herein after referred to as smart doorknob . The illustrated smart doorknob are located on external doors of the smart home environment . However it should be appreciated that smart doorknobs can be provided on all doors of the smart home environment . As illustrated in the smart doorknob includes a remote controlled electronic lock that locks a spindle . This locks the door because it prevents the spindle from disengaging a latch of the doorknob from a strike plate of a door stop . Accordingly the smart doorknob is able to automatically unlock the door without the user having to touch the doorknob. For example the smart doorbell can recognize a registered occupant approaching the door and instruct the smart doorknob to automatically unlock. It should also be appreciated that occupants can use a registered mobile device to remotely unlock the door. For example if when inside the home the occupant receives notice from the smart doorbell that a trusted neighbor is approaching the door the occupant can use the mobile device to unlock the door to the neighbor can let himself or herself in. Alternatively the occupant can speak an audible command instructing the smart doorknob to unlock. According to some embodiments the smart doorknob includes a remote controlled electronic motor that turns the spindle to disengage the latch of the doorknob from the strike plate of the door stop . Accordingly the smart doorknob is able to automatically open the door without the user having to touch the doorknob.

According to embodiments the smart thermostats the smart hazard detectors the smart doorbells the smart wall switches the smart wall plugs the smart entry detectors the smart doorknobs the keypads and other devices collectively referred herein to as the network connected smart devices of the smart home environment are connected to each other and to the central server or cloud computing system to accomplish security related objectives for the smart home environment. In addition to containing processing and sensing capabilities each of the network connected smart devices is capable of data communications and information sharing with any other of the network connected smart devices as well as to any central server or cloud computing system or any other device that is network connected anywhere in the world to accomplish security related objectives. The required data communications can be carried out using any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols Wi Fi ZigBee 6LoWPAN 3G 4G etc. and or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols CAT6 Ethernet HomePlug etc. . In some cases backup means of wireless communication e.g. 3G 4G is provided in the event the primary means of communication e.g. Wi Fi becomes disabled such as due to power outage.

According to embodiments all or some of the network connected smart devices can serve as wireless or wired repeaters. For example a first one of the network connected smart devices can communicate with a second one of the network connected smart device via a wireless router . The network connected smart devices can further communicate with each other via a connection to a network such as the Internet . Through the Internet the network connected smart devices can communicate with a central server or a cloud computing system . The central server or cloud computing system can be associated with a manufacturer support entity or service provider such as a home security provider associated with the network connected smart devices. For one embodiment a user may be able to contact local law enforcement and other emergency or security personnel as well as contact customer support using one of the network connected smart devices itself rather than needing to use other communication means such as a telephone or Internet connected computer. Further software updates and security alerts can be automatically sent from the central server or cloud computing system to the network connected smart devices e.g. when available when purchased at routine intervals when emergency news needs to be broadcasted throughout the home when the security system needs to be armed and when the smart home environment needs to be put on lock down .

According to embodiments the network connected smart devices combine to create a mesh network of spokesman and low power nodes in the smart home environment where some of the network connected smart devices are spokesman nodes and others are low powered nodes. Some of the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment are battery powered while others have a regular and reliable power source such as by connecting to wiring e.g. to 120V line voltage wires behind the walls of the smart home environment . The network connected smart devices that have a regular and reliable power source are referred to as spokesman nodes. These nodes are equipped with the capability of using any wireless protocol or manner to facilitate bidirectional communication with any of a variety of other devices in the smart home environment as well as with the central server or cloud computing system . On the other hand the network connected smart devices that are battery powered are referred to as low power nodes. These nodes tend to be smaller than spokesman nodes and communicate using wireless protocol that requires very little power such as Zigbee 6LoWPAN etc. Further some but not all low power nodes are incapable of bidirectional communication. These low power nodes send messages but they are unable to listen . Thus other network connected smart devices in the smart home environment such as the spokesman nodes cannot send information to these low power nodes.

As described the network connected smart devices serve as low power and spokesman nodes to create a mesh network in the smart home environment . Individual low power nodes in the smart home environment regularly send out messages regarding what they are sensing and the other low powered nodes in the smart home environment in addition to sending out their own messages repeat the messages thereby causing the messages to travel from node to node i.e. network connected smart device to network connected smart device throughout the smart home environment . The spokesman nodes in the smart home environment are able to drop down to low powered communication protocols to receive these messages translate the messages to other communication protocols and send the translated messages to other spokesman nodes and or the central server or cloud computing system . Thus the low powered nodes using low power communication protocols are able to send messages across the entire smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system . According to embodiments the mesh network enables the central server or cloud computing system to regularly receive data from all of the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment make inferences based on the data and send commands back to individual one of the network connected smart devices to accomplish some of the home security objectives descried herein. For example in the event the home security system is armed and one of the nodes either low or high power detects movement then the node can send a corresponding message through the mesh network to the central server or cloud computing system which processes the message and determines the appropriate response such as contacting authorities and or the home owner as well as instructing the network connected smart devices to enter an alarm mode which may involve activating lights sounding audible alarms etc.

As described the spokesman nodes and some of the low powered nodes are capable of listening . Accordingly users other devices and the central server or cloud computing system can communicate controls to the low powered nodes. For example as discussed below a user can use the portable electronic device e.g. a smartphone to send commands over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system which then relays the commands to the spokesman nodes in the smart home environment . The spokesman nodes drop down to a low power protocol to communicate the commands to the low power nodes throughout the smart home environment as well as to other spokesman nodes that did not receive the commands directly from the central server or cloud computing system .

Examples of spokesman nodes include smart doorbells smart thermostats smart wall switches smart wall plugs keypads doorknobs etc. These devices and are often located near and connected to a reliable power source and therefore can include more power consuming components such as one or more communication chips capable of bidirectional communication in any variety of protocols.

An example of a low powered node is a battery operated version of the smart entry detector . These smart entry detectors are often located in an area without access to constant and reliable such as in a window or door frame. According to embodiments the smart entry detector includes a low power wireless communication chip e.g. ZigBee chip that sends instantaneous messages coincident with movement of the door or window or with detection of a nearby person animal or object. In some embodiments the low power wireless communication chip regularly sends messages regarding the position open closed partially open etc. of the relevant door or window. These messages may be sent wirelessly using the mesh network from node to node i.e. network connected smart device to network connected smart device within the smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system .

Another example of a low power node is a smart nightlight . According to embodiments the nightlight houses a light source having variable intensity. Further according to embodiments the color of the light emitted from the nightlight is changeable. In addition to housing a light source the smart nightlight houses an occupancy sensor such as an ultrasonic or passive IR sensor and an ambient light sensor such as a photoresistor or a single pixel sensor that measures light in the room. In some embodiments the smart nightlight is configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and or when its occupancy sensor detects a person s presence or movement. The smart nightlight according to embodiments is configured to adjust the color and intensity of the light source. For example the smart nightlight adjusts the intensity of the light source in a manner where intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of natural light detected in the environment. According to embodiments the smart nightlight includes a low power wireless communication chip e.g. ZigBee chip that regularly sends out messages regarding the occupancy of the room and the amount of light in the room including instantaneous messages coincident with the occupancy sensor detecting the presence of a person in the room. As mentioned above these messages may be sent wirelessly using the mesh network from node to node i.e. network connected smart device to network connected smart device within the smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system .

Yet another example of a low powered node is a battery operated version of the smart hazard detector . These smart hazard detectors are often located in an area without access to constant and reliable power and as discussed in detail below may include any number and type of sensors such as smoke fire heat sensors carbon monoxide dioxide sensors occupancy motion sensors ambient light sensors temperature sensors humidity sensors and the like. Furthermore smart hazard detectors according to some embodiments include a low power wireless communication chip e.g. ZigBee chip that regularly sends messages that correspond to each of the respective sensors to the other network connected smart devices and the central server or cloud computing system such as by using the mesh network as described above.

According to embodiments the network connected devices a.k.a. the low and high power nodes of the smart home environment are capable of enhancing home security. For example as discussed all or some of the network connected smart devices are equipped with motion sensing heat sensing pressure sensing noise sensing or other types of sensing capabilities that combine with rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence of the central server or cloud computing system to detect the presence movement and or identity of people animals and objects and trigger various alarms in the event a person animal or object is in the wrong place at the wrong time anywhere inside or in the curtilage of the smart home environment .

By virtue of network connectivity a user can remotely interact with one or more of the network connected smart devices. For example a user can communicate with one or more of the network connected smart devices using a computer e.g. a desktop computer laptop computer or tablet or other portable electronic device e.g. a smartphone . A webpage or app can be configured to receive communications from the user and control the one or more of the network connected smart devices based on the communications and or to present information about the device s operation to the user. For example the user can view can arm or disarm the security system of the home.

As discussed users can control one or more of the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment using a network connected computer or portable electronic device . In some examples some or all of the occupants e.g. individuals who live in the home can register their mobile device with the smart home environment . Such registration can be made at a central server to authenticate the occupant and or the mobile device as being associated with the smart home environment and to give permission to the occupant to use the mobile device to control the network connected smart devices and the security system of the smart home environment . An occupant can use their registered mobile device to remotely control the network connected smart devices and security system of the smart home environment such as when the occupant is at work or on vacation. The occupant may also use their registered mobile device to control the network connected smart devices when the occupant is actually located inside the smart home environment such as when the occupant sitting on a couch inside the home or in a bedroom preparing for sleep.

It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to registering mobile devices the smart home environment makes inferences about which individuals live in the home and are therefore occupants and which mobile devices are associated with those individuals. As such the smart home environment learns who is an occupant and permits the mobile devices associated with those individuals to control the network connected smart devices of the smart home environment . As described herein various types of notices and other information are provided to occupants via messages sent to the occupants mobile devices and other electronic devices. It should be appreciated that these messages can be sent via email short message service SMS multimedia messaging service MMS unstructured supplementary service data USSD as well as any other type of messaging services and or communication protocols known in the art including any type of push notification service.

According to embodiments the network connected smart devices of the smart home environment are modular and can be incorporated into older and new houses. For example the devices are designed around a modular platform consisting of two basic components a head unit and a backplate which is also referred to as a docking station. Multiple configurations of the docking station are provided so as to be compatible with any home such as older and newer homes. However all of the docking stations include a standard head connection arrangement such that any head unit can be removably attached to any docking station. Thus in some embodiments the docking stations are interfaces that serve as physical connections to the structure and the voltage wiring of the homes and the interchangeable head units contain all of the sensors processors user interfaces the batteries and other functional components of the devices.

Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the old docking station. There are also many different versions for the head units such as low cost versions with few features and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units with a large number of features. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station. This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit such as a hazard detector is replaced by a new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed to a backroom or basement etc. According to embodiments when first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can indicate living room kitchen and so forth.

According to embodiments some of these modular smart devices have security enhancing features that trigger a notification or an alarm in the event the head is removed from the docking station. For example as discussed some smart devices are capable of detecting motion and function as tripwires in the security system. Others provide live video feeds and function as security cameras. In the event an intruder attempts to disable a network connected smart device and therefore avert detection by removing the smart device s head unit from its docking station an alarm or alert notification is triggered. For example the smart device sends a message indicating head unit removal to the central server or cloud computing system . Responsive to receiving a message indicating head unit removal the central server or cloud computing system according to embodiments sends a message to the home owner s or other occupants mobile device s indicating the removal and asking whether the removal is authorized. If no response after a timeout period or if the response indicates that removal was not authorized then the central server or cloud computing system triggers the alarm. In other embodiments such as when the alarm is armed i.e. in security mode the alarm is triggered immediately upon removal of the head unit. The alarm may be local on the head unit itself and therefore an alert sound it broadcasted from the head unit or may be centralized and controlled by the central server or cloud computing system and the other network connected smart devices are instructed to broadcast an alert sound. In still other embodiments upon removal the head unit asks the person to verbally identify themselves and if the voice is not recognized then the alarm is triggered.

The smart home environment may also include communication with devices outside of the smart home environment but within a proximate geographical range of the home such as within the home s curtilage. For example the smart home environment may include an outdoor lighting system that communicates information through the mesh network or directly to the central server or cloud computing system regarding detected movement and or presence of people animals and any other objects and receives back commands for controlling the lighting accordingly. The central server or cloud computing system can control the outdoor lighting system based on information received from the other network connected smart devices in the smart home environment. For example in the event any of the network connected smart devices such as smart wall plugs located outdoors detect movement at night time the central server or cloud computing system can turn on the outdoor lighting system as well as other lights in the smart home environment . This is advantageous over known outdoor motion detecting lights because the motion detection capability is not limited to just the motion sensor attached to the light itself but extends across the all network connected smart devices in the smart home environment .

The smart home environment may include a gated entry that communicates information through the mesh network or directly to the central server or cloud computing system regarding detected movement and or presence of people animals and any other objects and receives back instructions for controlling the gated entry such an opening closing locking unlocking the gate. According to embodiments an algorithm is provided for considering the geographic location of the smart home environment such as based on the zip code or geographic coordinates of the home. The geographic information is then used to obtain data helpful for determining optimal times for turning on off or otherwise adjusting lighting as well as opening closing locking unlocking gates or otherwise securing the smart home environment .

In some embodiments the mesh network of low powered and spokesman nodes can be used to provide exit lighting in the event of an emergency such as an earthquake a fire a detected home invasion dangerous CO levels etc. In some instances to facilitate this users provide pre configuration information that indicates exit routes in the smart home environment . For example for each room in the house the user provides a map of the best exit route. It should be appreciated that instead of a user providing this information the central server or cloud computing system or some other device could the automatically determine the routes using uploaded maps diagrams architectural drawings of the smart home house as well as using a map generated based on positional information obtained from the nodes of the mesh network e.g. positional information from the devices is used to construct a map of the house . In operation when an alarm is activated e.g. when one or more of the smart hazard detector detects smoke and activates an alarm the central server or cloud computing system or some other device uses occupancy information obtained from the low powered and spokesman nodes to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights e.g. nightlights wall switches wall plugs that power lamps etc along the exit routes from the occupied rooms so as to provide emergency exit lighting. It should also be appreciated that all or some of the network connected smart devices including the smart hazard detector and the smart thermostat include a light that is activated to help occupants evacuate the home. Additionally in the event of an emergency such as earthquake or fire an audible alarm can be sounded in the home giving information about the event. Also a message such as an SMS or MMS message may be sent to the mobile device of the occupants.

In some embodiments the mesh network of low powered and spokesman nodes can be used to provide security lighting in the event of an unauthorized occupant is detected in the home. In such cases all lights in and or outside of the home may be activated. Turning on all light will alert authorized occupants to the danger and will likely cause the unauthorized.

In some embodiments the smart home environment may include a home safe for storing valuables such as jewels money rare coins important documents etc. In the event an individual tampers with the safe such as if someone attempts to pick the lock carry it way or break it open the safe automatically sends out wireless alarms SMS notifies the authorities etc. The safe also includes a location tracking device such as GPS device so that in the event it is carried away it can transmit information about its location.

Although in some examples provided herein the devices and services platform communicates with and collects data from the network connected smart devices of smart home environment of it should be appreciated that the devices and services platform communicates with and collects data from a plurality of smart home environments across the world. For example the central server or cloud computing system can collect home data from the network connected devices of one or more smart home environments where network connected the devices can routinely transmit home data or can transmit home data in specific instances e.g. when a device queries the home data . Thus the devices and services platform routinely collects data from homes across the world. As described the collected home data includes for example security data such as a map of the home and the respective network connected smart devices and their capabilities in each room alarm settings information contact information for the registered occupants of the home etc. The collected home data may also include for example power consumption data occupancy data HVAC settings and usage data carbon monoxide levels data carbon dioxide levels data volatile organic compounds levels data sleeping schedule data cooking schedule data inside and outside temperature humidity data television viewership data inside and outside noise level data etc.

The central server or cloud computing architecture can further provide one or more services such as security related services described herein. The services can include sensor data collection logging where sensor data and other data from network connected smart devices of smart home environments is collected and logged. For example the data collected and logged may include maps of homes maps of users in home movements from room to room as determined by network connected smart devices equipped with motion and or identification technology time spent in each room intra home occupancy maps that indicate which rooms are occupied and by whom and different time including in real time fire detection incidents false alarms CO data temperature data humidity data etc. According to embodiments in the event the data collected from the network connected smart devices of a smart home environment indicates that an alarm threshold for a particular home is being approached the services increases the frequency at which it collects and logs data from network connected devices in that home. For example in the event the data collected from network connected devices indicates activity in a kitchen of a smart home environment while the occupants are asleep then instead of collecting data from the network connected smart devices of the home in thirty second intervals the services collects data in ten second intervals. According to embodiments the data collected and logged may be provided to investigators after the occurrence of a crime fire etc. so that the data may be used to solve the crime determine the cause of the fire etc.

The services can further include for example remote access remote or distributed control security improvement suggestions e.g. provide suggestions for enhancing security of a home based on collected home data etc. software updates customer support etc. Data associated with the services can be logged at the central server or cloud computing system and the central server or the cloud computing system can retrieve and transmit the data at an appropriate time e.g. at regular intervals upon receiving request from a user etc. .

As illustrated in an embodiment of the extensible devices and services platform includes a processing engine which can be concentrated at a single server or distributed among several different computing entities without limitation. The processing engine can include engines configured to receive data from network connected smart devices of smart home environments e.g. via the Internet or a hubbed network to index the data to analyze the data and or to generate statistics based on the analysis or as part of the analysis. The analyzed data can be stored as derived home data .

Results of the analysis or statistics can thereafter be transmitted back to the network connected smart device s that provided home data used to derive the results to other network connected smart devices to a user mobile device to a server providing a webpage to the user s mobile device or to other non device entities. For example patterns and statistics summarizing data received from network connected smart devices can be generated by the processing engine and transmitted. The results or statistics can be provided via the Internet . In this manner the processing engine can be configured and programmed to derive a variety of useful information from the home data . A single server can include one or more engines.

The derived data can be highly beneficial at a variety of different granularities for a variety of useful purposes ranging from explicit programmed control of network connected smart devices on a per home per neighborhood or per region basis for example security related statistics unique to particular neighborhoods can be used to control particular network connected smart devices to the generation of inferential abstractions that can assist on a per home basis for example an inference can be drawn that the homeowner has left for vacation and so security detection equipment can be put on heightened sensitivity to the generation of statistics and associated inferential abstractions that can be used for government or charitable purposes. For example processing engine can generate statistics about network connected smart device usage across a population of devices and send the statistics to device users service providers or other entities e.g. that have requested or may have provided monetary compensation for the statistics .

In some embodiments to encourage security related innovation and research and to increase security related and other products and services available to users the devices and services platform exposes a range of application programming interfaces APIs to third parties such as law enforcement agencies governmental entities e.g. the Health and Safety Agencies academic institutions e.g. university researchers businesses e.g. private security businesses emergency response providers such as fire and ambulance and other third parties. The APIs are coupled to and permit third party systems to communicate with the central server or the cloud computing system including the services the processing engine the home data and the derived home data . For example the APIs allow applications executed by the third parties to initiate specific data processing tasks that are executed by the central server or the cloud computing system as well as to receive dynamic updates to the home data and the derived home data .

For example third parties can develop programs and or applications such as web or mobile apps that integrate with the central server or the cloud computing system to provide services and information to users. Such programs and application may be for example designed to help users secure their homes by performing any of a variety of beneficial functions or tasks now known or hereinafter developed. Examples include providing user with local crime news information and statistics safety tips and check lists such as tips for installing security lights door and window locks etc.

According to some embodiments third party applications make inferences from the home data and the derived home data such inferences may include when are occupants home when are they sleeping when are they in the den watching television when they shower. The answers to these questions may help third parties benefit consumers by providing them with interesting security related information products and services. In one example a private security company creates an application that makes inferences regarding when people are away from home. The application uses the inferences to schedule private security officers to stop or drive by the home when people will most likely be away from home the application may also put the user s network connected smart devices in alarm mode notify trusted neighbors that the user is away etc.

In some embodiments the devices and services platform exposes APIs to third parties such as businesses exchange for revenue such as for a monthly fee similar to a subscription service. In one example the business may be a retail store that sells consumer products and building and construction supplies and materials including the network connected smart devices described above with reference to . In one example the retail store agrees to sale network connected smart devices at discount in exchange for free or discounted access to the APIs . The retails store can use the information from the APIs to better target their customers and increase sales. While the provider of the devices and services platform benefits from a proliferation of discounted network connected smart devices.

For example shows processing engine as including a number of paradigms . Processing engine can include a managed services paradigm that monitors and manages primary or secondary device functions. The device functions can include ensuring proper operation of a network connected smart device given user inputs detected that e.g. and responding to an intruder has entered or is attempted to enter a dwelling detecting a failure of equipment coupled to a network connected smart device e.g. a light bulb having burned out passive IR sensor having gone bad or alerting a user of a current or predicted future events.

Processing engine can further include an advertising communication paradigm that estimates characteristics e.g. demographic information time spend doing particular activities like cooking or watching television desires and or products of interest of a user based on data received from network connected smart devices. Services promotions products or upgrades can then be offered or automatically provided to the user. Processing engine can further include a social paradigm that uses information from a social network provides information to a social network and or processes data associated with user and or device interactions with the social network platform. For example a user s status as reported to their trusted contacts on the social network could be updated to indicate when they are home or away based on light detection security system inactivation or device usage detectors.

The processing engine can include a challenges rules compliance rewards paradigm that informs a user of challenges competitions rules compliance regulations and or rewards and or that uses operation data to determine whether a challenge has been met a rule or regulation has been complied with and or a reward has been earned. The challenges rules or regulations can relate to efforts to improve security in the home e.g. regularly lock door install adequate number of motion detectors or outdoor lights etc. to live safely e.g. reducing exposure to toxins or carcinogens to conserve equipment life to improve health etc. For example one challenge may involve participates achieve a certain security score by properly equipping their home with security devices and services and properly using and maintaining those devices. Those that successfully complete the challenge are rewarded such as by coupons virtual currency status etc. Regarding compliance an example involves a parent making a safety and security rule that children are not permitted to leave the home alone after a specified curfew such as 9 00 PM. The network connected smart devices in the home could track the movement of the various occupants and send alerts to the parent when a child leaves the home alone after the curfew or when the child is away from home after the curfew.

The processing engine can integrate or otherwise utilize extrinsic information from extrinsic sources to improve the functioning of one or more processing paradigms. Extrinsic information can be used to interpret data received from a network connected smart device to determine a characteristic of the environment near the device e.g. outside a structure that the device is enclosed in to determine services or products available to the user to identify a social network or social network information to determine contact information of entities e.g. public service entities such as an emergency response team the police or a hospital near the device etc. to identify statistical or environmental conditions trends or other information associated with a home or neighborhood and so forth.

An extraordinary range and variety of benefits can be brought about by and fit within the scope of the described extensible devices and services platform ranging from the ordinary to the profound. Thus in one ordinary example each bedroom of the smart home environment can be provided with a smart wall switch a smart wall plug and or smart hazard detectors all or some of which include an occupancy sensor wherein the occupancy sensor is also capable of inferring e.g. by virtue of motion detection facial recognition audible sound patterns etc. whether the occupant is asleep or awake. If a home intruder is detected the remote security monitoring service or police department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom and whether those occupants are still asleep or immobile and the real time location of the intruder in the home. Further video from the home can be broadcasted to video capable devices of the nearest security personnel and police so that the police can monitor the activity in the home while in route to the home. By way of another example the same data that is being used for home security can also be repurposed by the processing engine in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood security. Thus for example the same data discussed in the example above can be collected and made available for processing properly anonymized in which the crime patterns and home safety in a particular ZIP code can be tracked.

In some embodiments the devices and services platform provides a home security services into which users can enroll their smart home environments . The security services can be offered on a non commitment month to month basis. It should also be appreciated that the security services can be offered year to year or for lifetime. For example the security services can provide multi tiered offerings including offer basic plus and premium services. Basic services for example include basic intrusion detection and emergency personnel notification. For example the basic security services monitor incoming data from the network connected smart devices of the home to determine when a possible intrusion is occurring as indicated by motion detection outside the home information from the smart entry detectors indicating that any one of the doors or windows of the home have been opened etc. Upon detection the basic security services contact the occupants of the home and or local law enforcement. Plus security services for example monitor dangerous conditions in the home including smoke CO in addition to home invasion. Premium services include for example availing the home to the many benefits of neighbor security networks described below detecting when individuals in the home are in distress mimicking user patterns of turning on lights and appliances when the user is on vacation providing users with security scores and corresponding tips for improving the security of their home providing live video stream of activity in the home to the user when the user is away and to local law enforcement etc.

In some embodiments pricing for the security services varies depending on the security score of the home. As described below security score is based on information such having adequate numbers and placement of network connected smart devices e.g. hazard detectors entry detectors etc percentage of smart device that have WiFi rather than low power communication protocols percentage of smart devices that are wired rather than battery powered number of strangers that visit the home etc. The higher the security score of the home the more secure the home and the cheaper the security services. The devices and services platform according to embodiments provides suggestion regarding how to improve security scores and to incent users to improve their home s score the platform also indicates what discounts the user will receive if the user s home achieves a particular score.

In some embodiments upon receive an enrollment request from a user the devices and services platform assess the capabilities of the network connected smart devices in the user s home and determines whether the requested services are appropriate for the user. For example if the user request a premium services such as the capability to broadcast live video stream to law enforcement but the user only has but a couple of video enabled smart devices and or a limited WiFi network then the devices and services platform recommends that the user upgrade the smart devices in the home or select more basic services.

Examples of security related objectives will now be provided with reference to . In one security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices function as tripwires in the security system. In this example in the event one of the network connected smart devices detects motion heat sound etc. it sends a corresponding message through the mesh network e.g. from network connected smart device to network connected smart device and in some cases over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system which triggers an alarm if the security system is armed e.g. the occupants are away or asleep . In this example a user could enhance the security of the smart home environment by buying and installing extra network connected smart devices such as smart motion detectors and smart nightlights .

In another security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices are equipped with identification technology e.g. face recognition RFID ultrasonic sensors that fingerprints or creates a signature for the people animals and objects. The identification technology can be the same as or similar to the fingerprinting and signature creating techniques descripted in other sections of this application. In this example based on information received from the network connected smart devices the central server or cloud computing system stores a list of registered occupants and or guests of the home. When a person whose fingerprint or signature is not recognized by the central server or cloud computing system as a registered occupant or guest comes within range of or otherwise interacts with one of the network connected smart devices of the home the central server or cloud computing system logs that person s presence and if the security system is armed activates an alarm indicating the presence of an intruder. Further the central server or cloud computing system may reference maps of the smart home environment and schedules to whether the identified person animal or object is permitted to be in a particular area e.g. room of the house at a particular time and trigger an alarm accordingly.

In yet another security related example occupant location data e.g. GPS data IPS data etc is used to achieve home security objectives. According to embodiments the occupants of a home e.g. the individuals who live in or frequently visit the home register their respective mobile devices as being associated with the home and the central server or cloud computing system tracks the occupants movement inside and outside of the home based on occupant location data received from the mobile devices . The central server or cloud computing system uses this tracking information to make inferences regarding the current and future occupancy of the home and or rooms and to control the network connected smart devices inside the home in a corresponding manner. For example outdoor lights can be turned on when it is determined that an occupant returning home or the smart doorknobs can be locked and the security system can be armed when the occupant is leaving home. Also for example the threshold for notifying authorities of an emergency can be adjusted depending on whether an occupant having a registered mobile device is at home. For example if the register occupant is at home when an alarm condition e.g. fire distressed person home invasion is detected a message can be sent to the occupant s mobile device requesting confirmation that everything is okay. The authorities will only be notified if the registered occupant responds confirming that there is an emergency or if the registered occupant does not respond with in a timeout period. On the other hand if an alarm condition is detected and there are not registered occupants at home then the authorities are immediately notified and a concurrent message is sent to the mobile devices of the registered occupants.

In some instances the central server or cloud computing system receives occupant location data directly from the mobile devices whereas in other instances the data is received from an intermediary such as one of the network connected smart devices in the home. In instances where occupant location data is received directly from the mobile device the central server or cloud computing system can determine if the occupant is at home or away based on whether the received occupant location data corresponds with the location of the home. What s more in some embodiments the central server or cloud computing system can use the occupant location data received directly from the mobile devices to determine the occupant s actual room location e.g. bedroom kitchen garage etc. . To do so for example the central server or cloud computing system cross references the received occupant location data e.g. GPS data IPS data etc with a map of the home. On the other hand in instances where occupant location data is received from network connect smart devices the central server or cloud computing system can infer that the occupant is in the room where the network connected smart device is located. Network connected smart devices can detect mobile devices via WiFi Bluetooth NFC etc.

It should also be appreciated that passive RFID tags rather than or in addition to mobile devices can be used to determine the room location of occupants and pets . For example an RFID is associated with each of the occupants and pets of the house such as by including the tags in wallets bracelets wristbands mobile devices collars etc. The network connected smart devices in the various rooms detect the RFID tags and send that information to the central server or cloud computing system .

According to an embodiment the determined room location of an occupant is used determine which user controls to provide to the occupant s mobile device when the occupant uses the mobile device to control the smart home environment . In other words a different menu is displayed to the occupant depending on the occupant s location in the home. For example if the occupant is located in the garage then the displayed menu gives the occupant the option to turn up or down sensitivity of the smart entry detector of the garage door. Also for example if the occupant is in the kitchen then the displayed menu gives the occupant the option to adjust the smoke detection sensitivity of the smart hazard detector in the kitchen. This might enable the occupant to cook without triggering a smoke alarm condition. Further for example if the occupant is located in a bedroom then the displayed menu may give the occupant the option to lock the smart doorknob and arm the alarm system.

In the event all occupants of the smart home environment register their mobile device as being associated with the home the central server and cloud computing systems can infer that strangers are in the home when unknown mobile devices are detected. For example if the network connected smart devices detected two people in the home and both of those people are associated with registered mobile device then it can be inferred that no strangers are in the home. However if three people are detected in the home but only two people are associated with registered mobile devices then it can be inferred that there is one stranger in the home. A home may be considered less secure when there are unregistered mobile devices in the home and when there are more occupants than registered devices. For example a home that is undergoing a remodel and that has dozens of unregistered construction workers with unregistered mobile devices coming and going is less secure than a home where all occupants are associated with registered mobile devices and where there are no unregistered mobile devices in the home.

According to some embodiments occupants can use their registered mobile devices to access the smart home environment . For example the smart doorbell and the mobile device may be capable of communicating via near field communication NFC BLUETOOTH or some other short ranger wireless protocol. To gain access to the home e.g. cause the smart doorknob to unlock the mobile device of the user may transmit an access code to the smart doorbell which then verifies with the server that the person is a registered occupant.

Turning to another security related example the mesh network can be used to track a person s movement as the person transitions from room to room. As such the central server or cloud computing system knows which room in the smart home environment is occupied and by whom e.g. using identification technology at all times. For example the low powered and spokesman nodes e.g. network connected smart devices and detect the person s movement through the smart home environment and communicate corresponding messages through the mesh network. Using the messages that indicate which rooms are occupied the central server or cloud computing system logs the information for later use and or instructs various smart devices in the home to perform certain operations such as turn on and off lights lock the smart doorknobs sound alarms notify public safety authorities and the home owner etc. as the person enters and exits rooms.

According to embodiment the central server or cloud computing system can review the logged information about the occupants movement in the home to detect signature patterns of movement unique to the various occupants. These signature patterns help the central server or cloud computing system detect strangers in the home. For example if an individual is quickly moving from room to room at a time when occupants typically are not at home and according to a pattern that is not associated with any of the occupants the central server or cloud computing system may infer that this individual is a burglary move from room to room searching for valuable items.

In yet another security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices are equipped with WiFi BLUETOOTH NFC and or other wireless communication capability. Accordingly in the event one or more burglars enter the home carrying on their person their mobile devices e.g. smart phones the network enabled smart home devices upon detecting the home invasion condition automatically interrogate a burglar s mobile device to try and extract as much useful information as possible about the burglar including but not limited to the MAC address of their phone their cell number and or anything else that their mobile device will divulge about itself or the burglar. In addition an alarm message could be sent to the occupant s mobile device and also to a security service or police etc containing some or all of this information. According to embodiments the smart home environment and or the security service that monitors the smart home environment can automatically connect with wireless telephone carrier to determine which mobile devices are currently communicating with the cell tower s nearest the burglarized home. The wireless telephone carriers could automatically generate a suspect list that would necessarily include the burglar s mobile device.

According to embodiments the smart home environment includes a small cellular base station such as a picocell or microcell. Such cellular base stations provide great LTE 3G 4G etc data rate in the home and in some cases could replace or supplement WiFi. This base station could provide a cellular backup to call emergency personnel such as fire police in the event of an emergency. Also referring to the scenario above in the event a burglar is inside the home the base station could capture all unique IDs e.g. mac imei serial number from the burglar s mobile device.

In another security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices are equipped with video cameras. In this case the network connected smart devices can transmit video to the central server and cloud computing system which can make the video available to client devices such as the user device in the form of a live or prerecorded video stream. An occupant when away from the home can use their user device to connected to the central server and cloud computing system to receive live or prerecorded video of activity occurring in the home. In some embodiments central server and cloud computing system automatically provides video from the network connected smart device that is observing the most activity. For example if there is an intruder in the house the central server and cloud computing system can detect which room is experiencing the most activity e.g. based on noise and motion and provide video from that room. It should also be appreciated that the central server and cloud computing system can provide for display on the user device a grid of camera in the home to choose from. In this case the central server and cloud computing system can highlight which camera is observing the most activity so that the user knows that camera is likely the best one to select. It should also be appreciated that the network connected smart devices have a microphone and speaker and that two way voice communication can be established between the network connected smart device and the user device . For example the two way voice communication can be over internet protocol. This allows users to see and talk to home occupants when the user is away from home.

According to an embodiment in moments of distress the network connected smart devices can broadcast live video stream to nearby emergency personal such as police and fire departments. For example upon detecting an intruder or some other emergency occurring the home or upon someone pressing a panic button in the home live video can be broadcast to nearby emergency personnel such as police fire medical and other first responders. The video for example is transmitted from the room where the most activity is occurring or where the button was pressed. In some cases the video is transmitted directly to the police car that is responding to the call e.g. the closest police car . It should be appreciated that rather than broadcast the video may be provided via a secure stream using secure sockets layer SSL . It should also be appreciated that the security score of the home may be adjusted based on whether the home has the requisite SSL certificates in place to support the secure video stream to emergency personnel.

According to an embodiment the network connected smart devices function as nanny cams . In one example when the nearest network connected smart device detects that a sleeping child has woken it will turn on its camera and microphone speaker. The network connected smart device will then send a message to the user device of the parent home occupant who can accept the message to establish live video of the child and two way audio communication. It should be appreciated that live two way video communication can also be established. In the case the network connected smart device can project a video of the user include a video screen for display video of the parent and or control a nearby television or monitor to display video of the user. The network connected smart device can detect when the child goes back to sleep and can automatically shut down the video and or audio.

According to embodiments some or all of the network connected devices are equipped with pressure sensors such as digital air pressure sensors digital barometric pressure sensors etc. These pressure sensors may be for example resonant types that measure changes in air density thermal types that measure changes in thermal conductivity of air ionization types that measure changes in the flow of ions in air force collector types e.g. bellow diaphragm piston that measure deflection. One example security related application for these pressure sensors to detect opening and closing of doors as well as occupant movement in the house by sensing pressure variation patterns associated with such activities. For example when a door opens or closes the pressure sensors of the network connected smart devices would record the associated pressure variation. The central server and cloud computing system upon reviewing the recorded pressure variation can determine the activity associated with the pressure variation. For example pressure variation in a first range may indicated that an adult occupant walked through a doorway while transitioning from one room to another while pressure in a second range may indicate that a particular door internal or external opened or closed.

According to embodiments the smart home environment learns over time what activity corresponds with particular pressure variations detected by particular network connected smart devices in the home. For example a smart hazard detector located in a foyer near the front door of a home can learn that it is located near an external door. For example during initial installation the smart hazard detector can ask the installing user to indicate the room e.g. kitchen den foyer hallway etc in which it is being install and whether it is proximate to an external door. Later when it senses a pressure variation a message can be sent to an occupant s user device asking Was the external door near the foyer just opened Yes No Did an occupant just walk through the foyer Yes No . After the smart hazard detector learns which pressure differentials are associate with which activities it can contribute to home security. For example the smart home environment automatically goes into security mode when it determines that all occupants are in bed for the night or that all occupants are away from the home. When in this security mode if the smart hazard detector in the foyer senses a pressure differential that indicates the external door has just been opened it triggers the alarm.

According to embodiments the occupants of the home can pre program the smart home environment to broadcast specific alarms in response to specific detected conditions. For example in the event of smoke detection the smart home environment can broadcast via the network connected smart devices and or the home appliances such as television and stereos a pre recorded message from the occupant notifying the occupants of a possible fire and providing emergency exit instructions. In another example in case of detected home invasion the smart home environment can broadcast a message to the intruders notifying them that their presence has been detected that the occupants possess and are trained to use firearms to protect their home that the police have been notified etc.

According to embodiments the thresholds for triggering these alarms can be varied based on activities occurring in the home. More particularly technologies including the sensors of the network enabled smart devices in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided the central server and cloud computer system are used to vary alarm thresholds based on the occupants activities. Inferences about the occupants activities can be learned based on data received over time. For example if the smart hazard detector located in the kitchen observes increased temperature humidity and motion in the kitchen then an inference can be made that one or more of the occupants are cooking cooking inference . These data inputs can be considered on a sliding scale based on time of day and day of week. For example only slight increases temperature and humidity may invoke the cooking inference at 5 pm on weekdays when history shows that when the occupants typically cook. However much larger increases are required to invoke the cooking inference at 10 am on a weekday when the occupants are typically away at that time. In some embodiments the smoke alarm threshold is varied when the cooking inference is made. For example the smart hazard detector in the kitchen becomes less sensitive when one of the occupants is cooking whereas the hazard detectors in other room remain in normal operation.

In other embodiments alarm thresholds are varied based on human population in the home. Inferences about human population in the home can be made based on sensed changes in motion temperature CO noise air pressure differentials frequency of door openings and closings etc. According to one example in the event of detecting a concurrent increase in temperature motion noise and CO an inference can be made than there is a higher than normal human population in the home high population inference . Certain alarm thresholds may be adjusted when a high population inference is made. For example the alarm threshold for CO can be increased to account for the high number of CO emitting humans in the home and to avoid triggering a false CO alarm. In another example the security system can be disarmed so that guest can freely transition from room to room and in and out of external doors without triggering the alarm. On the other hand the alarm threshold for smoke detection can be decreased so that the smoke detectors are more sensitive than usual. This is to protect the large number of people in the home from fire. In other examples the network connected thermostat may adjust the temperature of the home to a standard temperature that is comfortable for most people. For example if the occupants like the house to be cool and teach the network connected thermostat to maintain the home at a cooler temperature then in the event of a high occupancy inference the network connected thermostat can adjust up to a temperature that is comfortable for most people. Similarly for example if the occupants like the house to be warm and teach the network connected thermostat to maintain the home at a warmer temperature then in the event of a high occupancy inference the network connected thermostat can adjust down to a temperature that is comfortable for most people.

According to embodiments alarm thresholds can be varied based on proximity of law enforcement and other emergency personnel. For example if a law enforcement office is nearby the threshold for the home invasion alarm condition can be increased. This may be applicable in apartments of buildings that have private security including a doorman.

According to some embodiments an occupancy emulator can be provided to emulate the occupants of a smart home environment when the occupants are away such as on vacation. For example the smart wall switches and or the smart wall plugs can function as an occupancy emulator by learning the occupants patterns of turning on and off lights appliances etc. and mimicking those patterns when the occupants are away.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing system processes artificial intelligence algorithms capable of making rules based or learning based inferences based on sensed patterns of user control of network connected smart devices optionally in conjunction with sensed home conditions or other sensed user behaviors. By way of example for one embodiment one or more of the smart wall switches is configured to process information acquired by home occupancy sensing devices in conjunction with information from light switch control behaviors of the user to produce a result in which the smart wall switches are automatically self programmed to help the user turn off and on lights according to a preferred schedule and to mimic the user s patterns when the user is away. This automatic self programming can also be applied to smart wall plugs which can learn when to turn on and off lamps as well as appliances such as televisions and stereos. Further it should be appreciated that all network connected smart devices can automatically self program.

In one example the artificial intelligence algorithms can be configured to sense whether there have been a threshold number of days over the past month or other evaluation period for which at roughly the same time of day X o clock the user has turned on or off the same or roughly the same set of smart wall switches and or smart wall plugs to turn on or off the same or roughly the same lights and or appliances in the home. If such pattern has been detected the user can be sent a message on their smartphone allowing them to opt in to a setting in which one or more the relevant smart wall switches and or smart wall plugs will be automatically turned on or off so as to turn on or off the relevant lights and or appliances at about X o clock. It should be appreciated that the smart home environment could learn and emulate other patterns. For example it could learn when the dog barks such as when a person is within 100 feet of the home or when an occupant returns home from work at about X o clock and then record and play back barking sounds at appropriate times. It should also learn when to open and close the garage door to give the appearance that the occupant is going and coming to and from the home.

By way of example the opt in message can say When you are not at home I can emulate your presence by automatically turning on the lights and television in the den at about X o clock on weekdays for about two hours and at about Y o clock on weekends for about three hours. It might better secure your home by deterring home invasions Would you like me to do this for you YES NO The user can then opt in to this functionality and or modify the schedule and opt in to the modified schedule. If the user s schedule changes and the artificial intelligence algorithms can learn the new schedule and make the proper adjustments. Thus in accordance with the described embodiment the collection of smart home sensors is configured to automatically learn selected user behaviors to emulate the user s patterns when the user is away and to automatically learn changes in the user s schedule and make corresponding adjustments.

According to some embodiments security of the smart home environment can be further enhanced predicting through inferences when the user intends to leave the home and raising away preparedness measures. To accomplish this artificial intelligence algorithms capable of making rules based or learning based inferences about when the user intends to leave the home based on sensed patterns of user control of smart home devices optionally in conjunction with sensed home conditions or other sensed user behaviors. By way of example for one embodiment one or more of the light switches is configured to process information acquired by home occupancy sensing devices in conjunction with information from light switch control behaviors of the user to predict when the user intends to leave the home. More particularly the artificial intelligence algorithms can be configured to sense whether there have been a threshold number of weekdays over the past month or other evaluation period for which at roughly the same time of day X o clock i the user has turned off a same or roughly same set of active light switches in the home including the front door light switch over a five minute period or other pre departure period and ii this event was followed by an extended period of non occupancy such as at least one hour of non occupancy. If such pattern has been detected the central server and cloud computing system makes an infers that the user intends to leave the home soon. Response to this inference the sensitivity of the network connected smart devices can be increased in anticipation of the user s imminent departure from the home. For example the threshold for triggering an alarm indicating a home invasion can be reduced. It should be appreciated that the pattern of turning off lights is merely an example and that other patterns exist on which imminent departure inferences can be made.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart devices located in the mesh network of the smart home environment in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at the central server or cloud computing system are used to provide a personal smart alarm clock for individual occupants of the home. According to embodiments the smart alarm clock is capable of monitoring weather and traffic data and adjust the user s wakeup time to account for delays that could be caused by bad traffic and weather. For example user occupants can communicate with the central server or cloud computing system via their mobile devices to access an interface for the smart alarm clock. There occupants can turn on their smart alarm clock and input a wake time for the next day and or for additional days. In some embodiments the occupant may have the option of setting a specific time at which the user would like to arrive at a particular destination. The user may input information about the destination and its location such as its address. Artificial intelligence will be used to determine how long it typically takes the occupant to wake up and get ready to leave the home. This information will be considered in combination with traffic on the route to the occupant s specified destination and weather conditions to determine what time to wake the occupant so that the occupant will arrive at the destination at the specified time.

According to embodiments the network connected smart device in the smart home environment that happens to be closest to the occupant when the occupant falls asleep will be the device that transmits messages regarding when the occupant stopped moving. This closest network connected smart device will be the device that sounds the alarm to wake the occupant in time to arrive at the specified destination accounting for traffic and weather conditions and how long it typically takes the occupant to get ready in the mornings. In this manner the smart alarm clock will follow the occupant throughout the house by tracking the individual occupants based on their unique signature which is determined based on data obtained from sensors located in the smart devices. For example the sensors include ultrasonic sensors passive IR sensors and the like. The unique signature is based on a combination of walking gate patterns of movement voice height size etc. It should be appreciated that facial recognition may also be used.

According to embodiments in the event of bad weather such as rain snow sleet ice etc. the smart alarm clock can communicate via the central server and or could computing system with the occupants automobile and thereby instruct the automobile to automatically shift into all wheel drive when the user starts up the automotible to drive to the destination. It should also be appreciated that in cold winter conditions the smart home environment can instruct the automobile to warm up and defrost while the occupant is getting ready for work or to leave the home.

 Mapping the smart home environment provides a number of advantages. For example informed by a map of the smart home environment the central server and cloud computing system can determine a distressed occupant s or an intruder s location in the home and notify emergency personnel regard the same. This enables emergency personnel to quickly find distressed people or intruders upon entering the home. In other examples the central server and cloud computer system determines an emergency exit route for each room of the home. In the event an alarm is activated e.g. when one or more of the smart hazard detectors detects smoke and activates an alarm the central server or cloud computing system uses occupancy information obtained from the network connected smart devices in the home to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights e.g. nightlights wall switches wall plugs that power lamps etc along exit routes from the occupied rooms so as to provide emergency exit lighting. These are just a few of example advantages of mapping the home and it should be appreciated that there are an unlimited number of advantages.

According to embodiments mapping of the home can be done automatically. For example a map generated based on positional information obtained from the nodes of the mesh network e.g. positional information from the network connected smart devices is used to construct a map of the house . According to this example the individual network smart devices obtain or determine their location upon being installed or at some other time and send the location information to the central server or cloud computing system or to a mapping application on the mobile device of a user. For example when installed a network connected smart device can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select bedroom or living room and so forth. In other examples smart device can provide the user with instructions such as Press button once if I am in the kitchen press twice if I am in the den etc. Also for example the smart devices may be capable of determining their GPS coordinates and or transmitting WiFi location or cellphone tower location information. The central server or cloud computing system or the mapping application on the mobile device uses this information to automatically construct a map of the home. In some examples a robot discussed below in detail roams free in the house and sends mapping information to the application on the mobile device or to the central server or cloud computing system which uses the mapping information to construct a map of the home. For example the robot could be put into a mapping mode where it obtains location data as it moves along the walls of each room in the house and then sends the location data to the application on the mobile device or to the central server or cloud computing system which uses the mapping information to construct a map of the home.

According to other embodiments an indoor positioning system IPS could be used to map the smart home environment . For example a user could launch a mapping application on the mobile device that uses IPS to create a map of home. In this case the user would walk along the walls of the home and the mobile device would collect location information using IPS and or other indoor localization techniques and use that information to construct a map of the home or send the collected information to the central server or could computer system which creates the map. It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to using IPS and or other indoor localization techniques the application on the mobile device could use the mobile device s gyroscope magnetometer accelerometer and altimeter to obtain location information.

According to still other embodiments RFID tags are used to map the smart home environment . For example RFID tags are placed throughout the home. Upon placing the tag the user could scan the tag using the mobile device which would launch an application instructing the user to input location information. Also for example instead of instructing the user to input location information the mobile device could determine its own location e.g. using any techniques know to those having skill in the art such as GPS at the time of the scan and associate that location information with the tag.

According to embodiments in the event of an alarm condition a map of the smart home environment is sent to emergency responders. For example upon detecting the emergency event such as an intruder or a distressed occupant the central server and cloud computing services sends a map e.g. a map created as described above of the smart home environment along with an indication of where on the map the emergency event is occurring. This map can be displayed in the vehicles or on mobile devices of emergency responders so that they can review the map in advance of entering the home. This will enable them to quickly find the appropriate location upon entering the home.

According to embodiments smart home environments can be grouped into neighborhood security networks and information can be shared among smart homes environments in the same neighborhood. For example in the event one smart home environment experiences a fire an intrusion a missing child a medical emergency or some other type of emergency or notable event notification is sent to other smart home environments in the same neighborhood. Such neighborhood security networks enable smart home environments to communicate with one another in real time or near real time about emergencies and other important events happening in the neighborhood. This real time communication enables network connected smart devices in non affected smart home environments to make appropriate security and safety related responses that minimize or eliminate impact from the emergency event such as lock the smart doorknob arming security systems turning on outdoor and indoor lights to deter home invasion sounding alarms to wake up and warn sleeping occupants of a nearby fire etc. In some cases these responses can even resolve or help resolve emergency events such as by using identification technology to locate a missing child or turning on outdoor lighting so that law enforcement can locate and apprehend fleeing criminals.

A number of different techniques may be used to create neighborhood security networks. According to some embodiments the central server or cloud computing architecture automatically creates the neighborhoods based on a combination of neighborhood criteria information such as geographic location of the homes demographic information about occupants of the homes and opt in information about which types of alerts the homes wish to receive. Geographic location information may include home address ZIP code GPS coordinates WiFi location information cellular tower location information etc. Demographic information about the occupants may include age gender health special needs etc. Opt in information may include fire alerts home invasion alerts missing children alerts missing pets alerts missing property alerts earthquake alerts etc. According to embodiments the network connected smart devices of smart home environments provide the neighborhood criteria information to the central server or cloud computing architecture upon registration and or during ongoing use and the central server or cloud computing architecture logs and stores the neighborhood criteria information the home data the derived home data and or another data.

According to some embodiments the central server or cloud computer architecture correlates network connected smart devices using the geographic location information and therefore creates the neighborhoods based on geo proximity such that home in close proximity to one another are grouped into the same neighborhood. It is possible that each smart home environment has its own neighborhood that includes other homes with in a predefined radius. This way each home is in the middle of its neighborhood and benefits from being surrounded by neighbors rather than being on the edge of a neighborhood. The geographic reach of the neighborhood may vary based on the type of event or emergency in question. For example in the event a home experiences a fire the central server or cloud computer architecture creates a neighborhood that includes all homes within one mile radius whereas if a child goes missing then the neighborhood can include all homes within a ten mile radius or all homes in a particular ZIP code city county etc.

According to some embodiments the central server or cloud computer architecture creates neighborhoods based on demographic information. For example in the event a teenage child of one smart home environment is out past his or her curfew the created neighborhood consists of nearby homes where teenagers are members of the household. This way notice that the teenager is out past his or her curfew is sent to the homes of the neighborhood and the teenager can be located if he or she is out visiting another teenager whose home is in the same neighborhood . In another example in the event an occupant of a particular home contracts the flu or some other communicable illness the created neighborhood consists of nearby homes where small children or elderly adults live. In this example a notice is sent to the other homes in the neighborhood so that precautionary measure can be taken to help prevent the young children and elderly adults from contracting the illness.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing architecture automatically identifies smart homes within a radius of the home experiencing the emergency or event and sends an alarm to the identified homes. In such instances the other homes in the neighborhood do not have to sign up for or register to be a part of a safety network but instead are notified of emergency or event based on their proximity to the location of the emergency or event. This creates robust and evolving neighborhood security watch networks such that if one person s home is getting broken into an alarm can be sent to nearby homes such as by audio announcements via the smart devices located in those homes.

However it should be appreciated the neighborhood security networks can be opt in services and that in addition to or instead of the central server or cloud computing architecture selecting which homes to send alerts to individuals can subscribe to participate in such networks and individuals can specify which homes they want to receive alerts from and the types of alerts to be received. This can include for example the homes of family members who live in different cities such that individuals can receive alerts when their loved ones in other locations are experiencing an emergency or other types events. In some examples that homes where having children can subscribe or opt in to be a part of a neighborhood that sends alerts when children are missing or out past curfew. Further homes having elderly people may can subscribe or opt in to be a part of a neighborhood that sends alerts regarding their elderly peers and attempt to form a community that looks out for the security safety and health of its members.

According to embodiments before a smart home environment is included in a neighborhood security network an opt in message is sent to the home owner such as via the home owner s mobile device . The home owner is provided with information about the other homes in the neighborhood the basis on which the neighborhood security network was form e.g. geographic location family relationships demographic information etc the types of information that will be shared with other homes in the neighborhood security network e.g. occupants away on vacation potential invasion missing child etc .

As discussed notification of an emergency or event occurring in one home can trigger responses in other homes in the neighborhood. . For example in the event of a burglary in one home the central server or cloud computing architecture instructions the network connected smart devices of the other smart home environments in the neighborhood to turn on outside lights to lock the smart doorknob and window latches to arm the security system. Also for example in the event smoke is detected in one home in the neighborhood the central server or cloud computing architecture can increase the sensitivity of the smoke detecting components of other smart hazard detectors in the neighborhood. In this example the neighborhood may include all units in the same apartment or condominium building. Further for example in the event a dog goes missing in one home the network connected smart devices of other homes in the neighborhood can be tuned to detect motions that indicate a dog. In this example if a dog is detected by an outdoor network connected smart device that does not typically detect dogs then a message can be send to the home of the missing dog indicated that a stray dog was detected and providing the location of the detection. Further in some examples the a RFID tag may be provided on the dog s collar and the network connected smart device of the other homes in the neighborhood may located the dog by reading the RFID tag and give the location of the dog upon request. RFID tags may be placed on other property too such as bicycles such that other property may be located in a similar manner.

According to embodiments individuals may manually broadcast messages to other homes in the neighborhood . For example when a family is leaving for vacation they can cause the central server and cloud computing system to send a notification to a network of trusted neighbors. This network can be manually defined or inferred.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing system may obtain and store identifying information such as facial recognition data for the occupants of the smart home environments . In this case when recognized an individual who is an occupant of one of the smart home environments is approaching an external door such as the front door of another smart home environment the smart doorbell via the processing capabilities of the central server or cloud computing system is able to recognize the approaching individual and announce his presence. For example the approaching individual s name and or status as being a neighbor may be announced a video of him approaching may be displayed and or his image such as a photograph taken from his social networking account may be displayed inside the smart home environment .

According to embodiments a security score may be calculated for a smart home environment. In some examples a security score for a home is calculated by comparing the security features of the home against a list of security criterions to determine how many of the security criterions are satisfied. Higher scores indicate that a home satisfies a high number of security criterions and is therefore relatively secure whereas lower scores indicate the home fails to satisfy many of the criterions. According to embodiments security scores can be normalized and scaled so that occupants of a home can compare the security of their home to other homes. For example a score of 0 to 100 can be used where 0 is the lowest possible score and 100 is the highest possible score. Further for example the central server or cloud computing system may generate a report or log that lists the security criterions and provides an indication of whether the home satisfies each of the criterions. Occupants can review this list to determine which criterions are not satisfied and then make the appropriate improvements to the home so as to include the home s security score. Additionally the central server or cloud computing system can use this log to generate a list of suggestions for improving the home. It can prioritize the list based on which criterions are associated with the most points indicate which creation can be easily and cheaply satisfied with only minor improvement and indicate which unsatisfied criterions are typically satisfied in other homes. For example the central server or cloud computing system can send the following message to an occupant s electronic device We notice that you often leave the front door unlocked. Most homes in your neighborhood keep the front door locked at all times. Locking your front door at night is an easy and inexpensive way to improve your home s security and to improve your security score. Example security criterions for assesses the security of and calculating a security score are discussed below. However it should be appreciated that any number and combination of security criterions can be used when assessing security and calculating a security score for a home.

One example security criterion is whether the home has a requisite number of network connected smart devices such as smart hazard detectors smart entry detectors etc. The requisite number can be determined based on the size of the home the number of bedrooms in the home the configuration of the home single story two story the number of occupants living in the home the laws rules and regulations of the jurisdiction s where the home is located etc. In some cases this information can be automatically obtained from public real estate databases. For example the central server and or cloud computing services can access a public real estate database s to obtain the size location configuration number of bedrooms bathrooms etc. The central server the central server and or cloud computing services can also access the home data to determine how many network connected smart devices are located in the home and compare that number to the requisite number to determine whether the criterion is satisfied.

Another example security criterion is whether the various types of network connected smart devices are properly located in the home. For example for this criterion the central server and or cloud computing services determine whether a smart entry detector is located at each window and external door whether a smart hazard detector with smoke and motion detecting capabilities is located in all of the appropriate locations such one in the kitchen and at least one on each floor of the home whether the doorbell of the home is a smart doorbell with the security capabilities described herein whether the wall switches are smart wall switches whether the wall plugs are smart wall plugs etc. The central server and or cloud computing services can make these determines by reviewing the home data to obtain information about the location and capabilities of the various network connected smart devices in the home and comparing that information against a map of the home. The map can be generated according to the example techniques described herein.

In some embodiments a security criterion is whether the house has been mapped . As discussed elsewhere herein maps of the homes can be created and stored in the home data . Mapping improves security not only because it enables the central server and or cloud computing services to determine whether the home has an adequate number of appropriate located network connected smart devices but it also enables the central server and or cloud computing services to pinpoint within the home where a security event is taking place and to provide that information for emergency responders. Another example security criterion is the average amount of time it takes first responders to get to the home after an alarm has been triggers. This information can be average based on data from nearby homes. If the response time is fast then the security score of the home is increased.

Other example security criteria related to the capabilities and configurations of the respective network connected smart devices in the home. For example the central server and or cloud computing services can access and review the home data to determine whether the network connected smart devices are wired rather than battery operated whether the batteries are sufficiently charged whether they are WiFi enabled and connected to a strong and reliable WiFi network whether the CO date codes of the smart hazard detectors are up to date whether there is cellular backup in the event WiFi goes down etc. Another example criterion is whether the hub spokesman node in the home is wired rather than battery operated .

In some embodiments the central server and or cloud computing services can review the security logs for the house provided in the home data to assess whether the occupants are keeping the home secure. For example one security criterion that can be considered during this review is whether a door or window was left unlocked overnight. Another example criterion is the number of strangers that visit the house on a regular basis. This can be determined per the discussion above by detecting strangers based on the number of unregistered mobile device and or occupants in the home. The more strangers that visit the less secure the home and the lower the security score. On the other hand if the home occupants regularly consist of just registered occupants then the more secure the home and the higher the security score. Another example security criterion is the number of unregistered mobile devices that come into contact with the home on a regular basis. This can be particular relevant for apartments condos and homes in densely populated areas where strangers are frequently nearby. One way the central server and or cloud computing services can make this determination is by reviewing the number of unrecognized mac addresses that contact the router of the home s WiFi network. In some examples for those homes located in apartment and condo buildings and in densely populated areas the mac addresses of the neighbors mobile device s can be factored out over time. For example if the same mac address is seen on a regular basis then it can be assumed that that device is associated with a neighbor and will not be used to lower the security score of the home.

Other example security criteria involve how readily the occupants or non resident individuals who are in a position to confirm whether an alarm condition is false can be contacted in the event of an alarm condition. Here for example the central server and or cloud computing services considers whether the occupants of the home have verified their contact information. For example this may include determine whether and which of the occupants have provided their emergency contact information e.g. mobile telephone number to the central server and or cloud computing services . The security score increases if the occupants have verified their contact information because in the event of an alarm condition the occupants can be contacted verify whether the alarm is false and if not they can help resolve or otherwise address the emergency. The security score increases even more if every occupant of the home verifies their contact information.

Another example security criterion is the quality of coverage in the home. For example the central server and or cloud computing services determines whether the home has a comprehensive mesh network of nodes that are capable of sensing conditions at all locations within the home and communicated data regarding the sensed conditions through the mesh network and to the central server and or cloud computing services . According to one embodiment to determine whether the home has a comprehensive mesh network the central server and or cloud computing services tracks an occupant s movement through the home to identify black spots which are areas in the home where the central server and or cloud computing services was unable to detect the occupant. The security score can be adjusted based on the extent of the black spots in the home.

At the process involves comparing the security data of the home against the obtained security criterions to determine which of the security criterions are satisfied. Here according to an embodiment the central server and or cloud computing service processes the obtained home data against the list of security criterions to determine which of the security criterions are satisfied. At the security score is calculated. To do so for example the central server and or cloud computing service determines a security score for the home based on the number of security criterion that were satisfied. The higher the number of satisfied criterion the higher the security score. At a security log is generated. For example the central server and or cloud computing service generates a log that lists each of the security criterions and corresponding indications of whether the respective criterions were satisfied. This log can be outputted for example by sending the log to the electronic devices of the occupants. In some embodiments the log includes a written description for each of the security criterions so that occupants can review the descriptions of the unsatisfied criterions to determine what they can do to improve the security of their home. In some examples the corresponding the corresponding indications of whether the respective criterions are satisfied are binary indicators whereas in other examples the corresponding indications are values indicative of a degree of compliance. For example if the home has fifty percent of the requisite number of smart hazard devices then the indication corresponding to that criterion can indicate that it is fifty percent satisfied. As discussed above the security criterions can include a proper sensor location criterion a low sensor battery criterion a low WiFi signal criterion a door open criterion a door closed criterion a door locked criterion a window open criterion and a window locked criterion.

According to some embodiments pre alarm condition trend detection and notification services are provided to warn users of potential dangerous conditions. More particularly technologies including the sensors of the network enabled smart devices in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided the central server and cloud computer system are used to make inferences about potential security conditions in the home. This may occur in situations where the sensor data is not strong enough to support an actual alarm condition but it is enough to cause an inference that potentially dangerous activity may occurring in the home and that it is worth investigating whether such activity is indeed occurring.

For example as discussed above the central server or cloud computing system can review the logged information about occupants movement in the home to detect signature patterns of movement unique to the individual occupants of the home. These signature patterns help the central server or cloud computing system detect strangers in the home. For example if an individual is quickly moving from room to room at a time when occupants typically are not at home and in a pattern that is not a signature pattern of any of the occupants the central server or cloud computing system may infer that this individual is potentially a robber moving from room to room searching for valuable items. While this inference may not rise to the level of a home invasion alarm condition it may be worth investigating. Thus the central server or cloud computing system sends a pre alarm alert message to the registered occupants mobile device information the occupants of the detected pattern that there may be suspicious activity occurring in the home. The message may include an indication of where in the house suspicious activity is occurring. The message may also request that the occupant verify that this is a false alert or that an actual home invasion condition exists.

In another example the smart doorbell may observe the same car parked on a street out front of the smart home environment over the course of several days. In particular the smart doorbell in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided the central server and cloud computer system may infer that the comings and goings of the car are consisting with burglars casing the home. Upon making this inference rather than triggering an alarm condition the central server and cloud computer system may send a pre alarm message to the occupants mobile devices and or to local law enforcement alerting them to the potential casing and including a description of the car.

According to other embodiments the pre alarm condition trend detection and notification can be applied to detect evaluated levels of potentially dangerous substances e.g. CO smoke etc in the smart home environment . For example an alarm condition may be established based at least in part on a predetermined amount of a substance in an environment. The alarm condition may be stored locally by a smart hazard detector or remotely by the central server and cloud computer system . For example once the concentration level of CO in the air reaches a certain level an alarm condition will be triggered. Additionally a pre alarm condition is established based at least in part on a predetermined trend in the amount of the substance in the environment. For example the pre determined trend can be at least a twenty percent increase in the amount of the substance over at least a two week period. After establishing the alarm and the pre alarm conditions the central server and cloud computer system the smart hazard detector and or other smart home devices receives sensor data indicating that the amount of the substance in the environment and analyzes the sensor data to detect the presence of either the alarm or pre alarm condition. Responsive to detecting the pre alarm condition but not the alarm condition the central server and cloud computer system the smart hazard detector and or other smart home devices provides a notification of the pre alarm condition. For example the central server and cloud computer system may send a message to the mobile device of the occupant stating The CO level in your home has increased twenty percent in the last two weeks. You might consider having an expert inspect your home to determine the cause. Also for example the smart hazard detector and or other devices in the home may make a similar audile announcement or display a similar written message.

Additionally the pre alarm message may be sent to a repair contractor or a public safety agency so that they can respond directly. For example the repair contractor may call the owner to notify the owner of the problem and prepare a plan to repair the problem. According to embodiments the pre alarm message giving notification of the pre alarm condition is sent to a centralized bidding system that solicits bids from repair contractors and selects one of the repair contractors to resolve the problem.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by running water. Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about water usage in the home and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that recognize what water sounds like and when it is running in the home. According to one embodiment to map the various water sources of the home upon detecting running water the central server or cloud computing architecture sends a message an occupant s mobile device asking if water is currently running or if water has been recently run in the home and if so which room and which water consumption appliance e.g sink shower toilet etc was the source of the water. This enables the central server or cloud computing architecture to determine the signature or fingerprint of each water source in the home. This is sometimes referred to herein as audio fingerprinting water usage. 

In one illustrative example the central server or cloud computing architecture creates a signature for the toilet in the master bathroom and whenever that toilet is flushed the central server or cloud computing architecture will know that the water usage at that time is associated with that toilet. Thus the central server or cloud computing architecture can track the water usage of that toilet as well as each water consumption application in the home. This information can be correlated to water bills or smart water meters so as to provide users with a breakdown of their water usage.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by mice and other rodents as well as by termites cockroaches and other insects collectively referred to as pests . Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about pest detection in the home and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that recognize what certain pests sound like how they move and or the vibration they create individually and or collectively. According to one embodiment the central server or cloud computing architecture can determine the signatures of particular types of pests.

For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture detects sounds that may be associated with pests it notifies the occupants of such sounds and suggests hiring a pest control company. If it is confirmed that pests are indeed present the occupants input to the central server or cloud computing architecture confirmation that its detection was correct along with details regarding the identified pests such as name type description location quantity etc. This enables the central server or cloud computing architecture to tune itself for better detection and create signatures or fingerprints for specific types of pests. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can use the tuning as well as the signatures and fingerprints to detect pests in other homes such as nearby homes that may be experiencing problems with the same pests. Further for example in the event that two or more homes in a neighborhood are experiencing problems with the same or similar types of pests the central server or cloud computing architecture can make inferences that nearby homes may also have such problems or may be susceptible to having such problems and it can send warning messages to those home to help facilitate early detection and prevention.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by intruders impermissibly entering the home. Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about home invasion and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that assess detected sounds vibrations and movement in view of whether the home occupants are home or way sleeping or awake etc.

For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture detects sounds proximate to windows doors and other external entryways while concurrently receiving information that all registered occupants are away from the home or are accounted for and asleep in their respective rooms the central server or cloud computing architecture alerts the occupants to the possible invasion and or deters the intruders by turning on nearby lights sounding audible warnings etc. For example the audible announcement could be an indication that an intrusion is occurring. This will alert the occupants and hopefully scare away the intruder.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created when an occupant of the home is under distress such as when an individual falls and cannot get up. Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about the respective occupants of the home and their patterns of movement. These inferences may be enhanced by providing the central server or cloud computing architecture with age health and other information about the individual occupants. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can identify and track the movement through the home of the respective occupants using techniques described herein such as based on their signature or signals emitted from their tracking devices e.g. mobile phones and activate a distress alarm when an occupant s movement indicates distress. For example an elderly occupant may be in distress immediately after making a very swift movement or causes a strong vibration that an elderly person would be incapable of making unless that person were falling. A distress alarm may also be activated when an occupant remains in one position such as in bed or in a bath for a period that exceeds a threshold. Further a distress alarm may be activated upon receiving a verbal command such as help from an occupant.

For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture detects sounds proximate to windows doors and other external entryways while concurrently receiving information that all registered occupants are away from the home or are accounted for and asleep in their respective rooms the central server or cloud computing architecture alerts the occupants to the possible invasion and or deters the intruders by turning on nearby lights sounding audible warnings etc.

Turning now to illustrations are provided of exemplary embodiments of the smart wall switch . According to embodiments the wall switches enhance the smart home environment by providing a retrofit wall light switch that in addition to maintaining the basic character and purpose of a light switch incorporates a host of host of sensing interface and communications capabilities for enhancing occupant comfort convenience and safety.

By virtue of being mounting in place of traditional wall switches the wall switch has access to plentiful electrical operating power such as by connecting to wiring e.g. to 120V hot line voltage wires that is behind the walls of the smart home environment and that is present at virtually all standard home wall light switches. This essentially unlimited power budget the near ubiquity of excellent installation locations throughout the home and the reasonably ample physical space on its face plate and in its housing to fit the necessary components combine to enable the wall switch to accommodate a rich and wide variety of sensing interface and communications capabilities for the smart home environment as well as a general platform for the provision of even newer sensing interface and communications hardware as it becomes available over the coming decades.

A rich variety of new interactions are made possible between wall switch and other devices of the smart home environment . Occupancy sensing for example can be significantly enhanced by virtue of the great locations usually right next to room doorways of most wall light switches allowing for easy tracking of occupants as they transition between rooms predictive occupancy algorithms and so forth.

As illustrated in according to some embodiments the wall switch is split into two parts a head unit and a backplate . This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the wall switches by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. According to some embodiments the backplate is a permanent interface box sometimes referred to herein as docking station that serves as a physical connection into the wall and to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment and that contains a AC to DC powering circuitry . When installed the docking station may resemble a conventional one gang or two gang wall box except no dangerous high voltage wires are exposed to the user. According to some embodiments docking station also includes a cellular wireless interface.

According to some embodiments the head unit sometimes referred to herein as replacement module actually contains all of the sensors processors user interfaces the rechargeable battery and so forth. Users can plug and unplug the unit in and out of the docking station . Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the docking station . There are also many different versions for the head unit such as an extremely low cost version that is nothing but a motion occupancy detector and light switch and then a progression of increasingly capable version up to and including extremely fancy head unit with small OLED televisions and high fidelity mini speakers. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station . This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for the kitchen or living room for example can replaced by a great new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed in a bedroom or a basement etc. When first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select bedroom or living room and so forth. In other examples the head unit can provide instructions such as Press button once if I am in the kitchen press twice if I am in the den etc. 

According to some embodiments the head unit contains a main processor storage display and user interface audio speaker microphone power converter GPS receiver RFID locater and general physical module receiver . The head unit further contains wireless and wired networking . In view of the ample power availability a variety of communications capabilities can be provided including Wi Fi ZigBee 3G 4G wireless CAT6 wired Ethernet and even optical fiber from the curb. Furthermore because the wall switch can be connected to the home 120V system a HomePlug or other powerline communications capability can be provided.

Also included are sensors such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion ultrasound CCD video camera etc. A rechargeable battery is also included or equivalently capable onboard power storage medium . For example the battery can be rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. In operation the wall switch charges the battery during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is less than what power stealing can safely provide and that will discharge to provide the needed extra electrical power during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is greater than what power stealing can safely provide.

The user interface can include one or more visual displays TFT OLED etc. touchscreen and or button input capabilities the audio speaker and so forth. According to the embodiment illustrated in the module head unit of smart wall switch has a click and rotate annular ring input . According to this embodiment the click and rotate annular ring input of the wall switch can be used as a dimming light switch. Further the click and rotate annular ring input can provide menu driven interfaces for user governance of all its various capabilities. As illustrated in an optional 2D image and or 3D holographic image projector can also be provided so that the effective dimension of the display is not just limited to the physical size of the wall light switch. For example in smart home environments that also include smart doorbells the combination of the smart wall switches and the smart doorbells can bring about new features. For example if a visitor approaches the front door or rings the doorbell the camera in the doorbell can transmit their image to the smart wall switches which can instantly show the image on the dial of the light switch or project the image in 2D or 3D holographic form. Further for example the image of the arriving visitor at the front door can be projected only from the smart wall switches of those rooms where occupancy is sensed.

According to one embodiment that is particularly appealing for a lighting control functionality of the described the wall switches which are temporarily simply termed light switches for this lighting control related embodiment. The light switches in the home such as the smart home environment are configured such that at least one of them can be used to control a all of the light switches in the home b a single selectable one of the other light switches in the home and or c one or more selectable groups or sub groups of the other light switches in the home. This can be particularly convenient for example for a light switch that is near the front door or other entryway commonly used for ingress and egress of the home. For such exemplary scenario an occupant who is the last person to leave the home can simply turn off all lights at once by controlling the single light switch nearest the door. Similarly a returning occupant can turn on a particular subset of lights for example the lights corresponding to a pathway from the front door to the kitchen all at once by controlling that single light switch. As another advantageous example a light switch that is in an upstairs master bedroom of the home can be used by the parents to control a the lights in all downstairs rooms in the home b the lights leading between the master bedroom and the kitchen and or c the lights in each of the children s bedrooms.

The above described provision for mutually controllable or selectively mutually controllable light switches can be extended in other embodiments to similar mutual or selectively mutual control of any population of smart home controllers that are so amenable. Examples can include mutual or selectively mutual control of irrigation controllers door opening closing actuating controllers entertainment device controllers computing device controllers portable plug in heater controllers window opening closing controllers and so on.

In some embodiments a network connected smart keypad is provided in the smart home environment . According to embodiments an important underlying functionality of the smart keypad is to control the functionality of security features of the smart home environment . It should be appreciated that the smart keypad is enhanced with a variety of multi sensing capabilities that while indeed enhancing home safety and security in many ways can provide additional functionalities relating to controlling the other smart devices in the home HVAC control home energy conservation intra home communications entertainment etc.

According to embodiments smart keypad includes powering circuitry including a rechargeable battery for extracting power as needed from the 120V hot line voltage wire. The rechargeable battery can either be used as a conventional back up source or as a reservoir to supply excess DC power if needed for short periods.

According to some embodiments like other smart home devices described here the smart keypad is split into two parts a head unit and a backplate. This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the smart keypads by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. According to some embodiments the backplate is a permanent interface box sometimes referred to herein as docking station that serves as a physical connection into the wall and to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment and that contains AC to DC powering circuitry. When installed the docking station may resemble a conventional one gang or two gang wall box except no dangerous high voltage wires are exposed to the user. According to some embodiments docking station also includes a cellular wireless interface.

According to some embodiments the head unit sometimes referred to herein as replacement module actually contains all of the sensors processors user interfaces the rechargeable battery and so forth. Users can plug and unplug the unit in and out of the docking station. Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the docking station. There are also many different versions for the head unit such as an extremely low cost version that is nothing but a user interface and then a progression of increasingly capable version up to and including extremely fancy head unit with small OLED televisions and high fidelity mini speakers. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units of the smart keypads and other smart devices can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station. This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for the kitchen or living room for example can replaced by a great new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed in a bedroom or a basement etc. When first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select bedroom or living room and so forth. In other examples the head unit can provide instructions such as Press button once if I am in the kitchen press twice if I am in the den etc. 

According to some embodiments the smart keypad contains a main processor storage display and user interface audio speaker microphone power converter GPS receiver RFID locater and general physical module receiver. The smart keypad further contains wireless and wired networking. In view of the ample power availability a variety of communications capabilities can be provided including Wi Fi ZigBee 3G 4G wireless CAT6 wired Ethernet and even optical fiber from the curb. Furthermore because the smart keypad can be connected to the home 120V system a HomePlug or other powerline communications capability can be provided. Accordingly the smart keypad can be connected to and communicate with the other smart home devices of the smart home environment and to the central server or cloud computing system .

The smart keypad can include any of the components e.g. temperature sensor humidity sensor occupancy sensor ambient light sensor communication equipment processors memory etc. that are included in any of the other smart home devices e.g. smart doorbells smart thermostats smart wall switches smart wall plugs etc. described herein. In some embodiments the smart keypad is hardwired with a battery backup. In some embodiments the smart keypad is incorporated into the wall switch whereas in other embodiments the smart keypad can be its own device.

The smart keypad also includes sensors such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion ultrasound CCD video camera etc. As mentioned above a rechargeable battery is also included or equivalently capable onboard power storage medium . For example the battery can be rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. In operation the smart keypad charges the battery during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is less than what power stealing can safely provide and that will discharge to provide the needed extra electrical power during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is greater than what power stealing can safely provide.

The user interface of the smart keypad can include one or more visual displays TFT OLED etc. touchscreen and or button input capabilities the audio speaker and so forth. According to embodiments an optional 2D image and or 3D holographic image projector can also be provided so that the effective dimension of the display is not just limited to the physical size of the smart keypad. The user interface can be user customized by the home occupants.

The smart keypad can be secured by a user determined passcode. In some embodiments the passcode can be a PIN comprising any number and combination of letters and or numbers. In other embodiments the passcode can be a phrase. In yet other embodiments the passcode can be a gesture which the smart keypad senses using ultrasonic sensors PIR sensors etc. In still other embodiments the passcode is in the form of a unique connect the dot pattern where the user interface displays a plurality of dots e.g. a grid of dots and the user moves his or her finger from dot to dot in a unique pattern. Any one of these forms of the passcode including the gesture and the connect the dots pattern can provide users with a quick and easy way to arm and disarm the alarm system of the home. For example when leaving the home the user can walk up to the smart keypad and make the unique gesture or input the connect the dots pattern to arm the alarm. According to some embodiments the smart keypad manages a user list which includes a list of users and corresponding times they can control the keypad to arm disarm the security system and to control other functions of the smart home. In some cases the various users may identify themselves to the smart keypad using unique identification numbers and access codes including the passcodes described above. Further in some cases the smart keypad may be capable of recognizing a user based on the user s digital fingerprint such as by wirelessly identifying the user s mobile electronic device .

According to embodiments the smart keypad includes a light your path feature whereby the smart keypad activates a light when it senses that a user is approaching in darkness or near darkness. For example in the event the user approaches the smart keypad in the middle of the night the smart keypad may activate nearby lights in the home or a light incorporated in the smart keypad itself e.g. LED to provide a lighted pathway for the user. In one example the smart keypad is incorporated in a wall light switch and the smart keypad activates the light associated with the wall switch when a user is approaching the smart keypad. In some examples upon detecting an approaching user when the security system is armed the smart keypad or other devices of the home or the server can send notification to the occupants mobile devices or other electronic devices. Also for example the smart keypad can send a notification message to the occupants mobile devices any time the alarm system is armed or disarmed by a user.

According to embodiments the smart keypad is smash and bash resistant. For example in the event the home s alarm system is armed and the smart keypad is smash e.g. by an intruder attempting to disarm the alarm by bashing the keypad the alarm remains armed. In some cases upon being smashed the smart keypad triggers the alarm and executes pre configured actions such as notifying police and or other emergency personnel.

According to embodiments the smart keypad or other devices in the home are capable of assigning user defined gestures to actions or sets of actions. For example the user may program the smart keypad with a panic gesture that causes the smart keypad other devices in the smart home or the server to notify authorities such as by calling or otherwise notifying medical police etc. Such a panic gesture may be for example the user quickly waving his or her hands in the air. The user may also program the smart keypad or other devices in the home with an audible panic command. For example when the user yells help then medical police etc may be called or otherwise notified. In other examples the smart keypad can include a panic button that the user can press to call the police medical etc.

According to embodiments the smart keypad or any of the other smart home devices have the ability to display customer messages such as via a display on the device itself or by projection. For example in the event a child is sleeping the smart doorbell may display Baby is sleeping. Do not ring. In other embodiments the smart keypads and other devices are capable of projecting or displaying messages. For example when a person is at the front door the keypads may project a message such as Someone s at the door . This would be good for situations where the users have deactivated or the smart home has automatically deactivated the doorbell and or other audible notifications because some or all of the occupants are sleeping. These messages would also be useful for hearing impaired occupants. The smart keypads and other devices could also project or display warning messages such as Evacuate due to possible intruder fire CO etc. The message could be projected in large font on walls floors ceilings etc. And the message could provide additional information. For example the message could be Intruder detected in den Fire detected in kitchen etc.

According to embodiments the smart keypad and the other smart devices are used as platform for running home applications. For example the smart keypad has the capability of downloading and or executing applications that enable users to control their smart homes. For example the user could install a thermostat app that can be accessed and controlled from any of the smart devices in the home including the smart keypads to control the home s HVAC. The user could also install a security app for example. It should be appreciated that the number and type of apps that could be download and installed are endless.

Turning now to an illustration is provided of an exemplary embodiment of the smart hazard detector . According to embodiments an important underlying functionality of each smart hazard detector is for smoke detection fire detection and carbon monoxide detection more generally hazard detection and associated audible alarming via a speaker and a buzzer . However it should be appreciated that the smart hazard detector is further enhanced with network connectedness and a variety of multi sensing capabilities that while indeed enhancing home safety and security in many ways can provide additional functionalities relating to HVAC control home energy conservation intra home communications and entertainment. In some embodiments the smart hazard detector complies with the standards as required by Underwriter Laboratories UL for detecting smoke heat and carbon monoxide. For example the smart hazard detector meets the alarm response time requirements of UL standard 2034 which are as follows at 70 PPM the detector must alarm within 60 240 minutes at 150 PPM the detector must alarm within 10 50 minutes and at 400 PPM the detector must alarm within 4 to 15 minutes.

According to embodiments the smart hazard detector is a retrofit designed to replace older hazard detectors. Although not shown in the figures the smart hazard detector may comprise two primary components a head unit and a backplate or docking station . The head unit comprises the sensors battery processor storage and other components while the docking station serves as a physical connection into the wall and if applicable to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment . When installed the docking station may resemble a conventional backplate for a tradition hazard detector. Users can plug and unplug the head unit in and out of the docking station. Thus many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the docking station. There are also many different versions for the head unit such as an extremely low cost version that is nothing but a smoke detector and then a progression of increasingly capable version up to and including extremely fancy head units. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station. This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for detecting hazards in the kitchen for example can replaced by a newer version then the old head unit can be re deployed in a bedroom or a basement etc. When first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select bedroom or living room and so forth.

There can be substantial overlap between the smart hazard detector and the wall switch as well as the other devices of the smart home environment with respect to processing sensing user interface and communications capabilities. The smart hazard detector may be a low power consuming device that is powered by battery and that includes a low power communication chip such as a ZigBee chip and may participate as a low power node in the mesh network of the smart home environment by generating and transmitting messages relay messages from other devices as well as by listen and sometime making a corresponding response. However it should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to being battery powered the smart hazard detector may be powered by AC voltage from the home. In some embodiments the smart hazard detector includes a WiFi chipset that enable it to communicate its status to other devices in the smart home environment to user mobile devices to the central server or cloud computing system as well as to external managed security services. It should be appreciated that smart hazard detector is microprocessor driven and that the WiFi chip may contain extra processing capacity for controlling all or some operations of the smart hazard detector . In some embodiments a separate processor is provided.

According to the illustrated embodiment the smart hazard detector includes a smoke detector which comprising a smoke photodiode a detector and a smoke chamber. The smoke photodiode may be for example an IR LED. Alternatively instead of IR a visible light LED or a laser may be provided. In some embodiments the detector may be a photon silicon photomultiplier chip. The smoke photodiode and the detector may be programmed to execute a duty cycle every ten seconds or so. For example every ten seconds the photodiode and the detector will do an X axes microsecond smoke test. The photodiode and the detector also execute self calibration tests at predetermined intervals.

Further the smart hazard detector includes a carbon monoxide sensor which can be either an electrochemical sensor or a metal oxide semiconductor. Additionally the smart hazard detector may include a temperature sensor a humidity sensor for reducing false alarms associated with showering and cooking and an ambient light sensor such as a single pixel that measures the brightness of the room.

The smart hazard detector may be provided with occupancy detecting capabilities. According to an embodiment one or more ultrasonic sensors are provided for motion detecting. However it should be appreciated that in addition to or instead of the ultrasonic sensors one or more passive IR sensors are provided for occupancy sensing. Having multiple ultrasonic sensor and or passive IR sensors enhance the occupancy sensing capabilities of the detector. Because they are typical mounted in unobstructed locations high on walls of often occupied rooms smart hazard detectors are particularly well suited for occupancy detection such as by the use of RFID ultrasonic sensors etc. The smart hazard detector may also include a thermopile for flame heat detection. As it is well known in the art the thermopile or thermo camera is a group of thermo couples that take infrared light and correlate that to flame heat. In some instances this is advantageous because the thermo camera looks into the room and gives advanced warning of heat. Thus the thermo camera is able to see heat before the heat actually makes its way to the smart hazard detector .

In some embodiments the smart hazard detector is equipped with one or more air quality sensors . For example the air quality sensors may sniff for volatile organic compounds VOCs that may present in the house. Thus the smart hazard detector can warn users when there are toxins in the user s home such as when the user is burning a paraffin wax candle. Paraffin is a by product of petroleum has been shown to release an alarming range of VOCs such as such as toluene and benzene. Also for example the air quality sensors can sniff for gas leaks in the house such as by detecting methane which is commonly added to natural gas so as to make natural gas detectable. This sniffing capability is not only good for houses but also for schools and hospitals. Individual will find peace of mind knowing such detection is in widespread use. Further as houses get more and more sealed air quality detection will grow in importance. Further the air quality sensors can measure levels of particulate dust pollen mold etc detection.

In addition to measuring air quality and detecting harmful VOCs the smart hazard detector is capable of transmitting this information to the other devices in the home as well as the central server or cloud computing system . For example in some embodiments when there are elevate levels of patent harmful gases particulate dust pollen mold etc in the home the smart hazard detector can transmit this information to the central server or cloud computing system which communicates with other nodes in the home and just outside of the home such as the smart doorbell and assess whether the inside air or the outside air is purer. If the outside air is purer then the central server or cloud computing system instructs the smart thermostat to open a vent to permit fresh air into the home otherwise it instructs the thermostat to recirculate air in the home and to not draw in outside air. Furthermore the central server or cloud computing system upon receiving the air quality information from the hazard device can send detailed information about the air quality to the mobile device of user. For example the air quality information may identify the specific types of toxins particulate dust pollen mold etc in the air. This can help the user identify which pollen etc the user is allergic to. Further the central server or cloud computing system can use the air quality information to provide the user with medication recommendations e.g. be sure to take you allergy pills today . Furthermore the central server or cloud computing system can aggregate data received from multiple home in various geographic locations and provide for example smog alerts pollen warnings etc.

According to some embodiments the smart hazard detector may include a carbon dioxide CO sensor for fire detection where detector includes a passive IR detector from lead selenide. Fire produces CO CO and infrared light. The intensity of the infrared light emitted by the flame is pretty constant until it passes through the layer of COproduced by the fire. However the frequency of light having a wavelength of 4.26 excites COmolecules when the light contacts the CO. In response the COabsorbs the infrared light having a wavelength of 4.26 thereby decreasing the intensity of the light at this wavelength. Thus to detect fire a narrow optical bandpass filter is placed in front of the lead selenide IR detector to permit only light having a wavelength 4.26 to pass through to the lead selenide IR detector. In the event of fire the lead selenide detects the decrease in intensity of light at a wavelength of 4.26 and triggers the fire alarm.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart hazard detector in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as are used to warn occupants of dangerous conditions in the home. For example an inference can be made that an occupant is burning a candle based of the qualities e.g. intensity wavelength frequency etc of the light and or the toxins begin released into the air. Further an inference can be made that the occupant in the room has fallen asleep when the occupant is in the room and has not moved for a predetermined period of time. In situations where a candle is burning and the occupant has fallen asleep the smart hazard detector in that room will sound an alarm to wake up the occupant. In other example the smart hazard detector can sound an alarm or send an alert text or email message when it detects dangerous conditions in unoccupied rooms such as when the stove is left on in the kitchen.

In the event a fire does occur in the home technologies including the sensors of the hazard detectors in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as are used to determine the cause. For example the smart hazard detector can detect that the fire started in the kitchen and the smart hazard detector can detect an active stove candle etc was left unattended in the kitchen just before the fire started. Additionally a central server such as can aggregate data from multiple homes that experienced a fire analyze the data to find patterns and reconstruct what caused the fires and share this information with fire departments.

In some embodiments the smart hazard detector is mounted in a location that is out of reach of the occupants such as high on a wall or on a ceiling. Thus in the event of a false alarm the occupants cannot reach the smart hazard detector to press a button that deactivates the alarm. Accordingly embodiments of the smart hazard detector allow for occupants to deactivate the alarm using silence gestures . For example the smart hazard detector detects a particular silence gesture from one of the occupants and in response deactivates the alarm.

According to embodiments the one or more ultrasonic sensors of the smart hazard detector are used to detect the silence gesture of the occupant. In some embodiments each of the ultrasonic sensors may contain multiple piezos so as to make the sensor omni directional and to make it easier to detect when an occupant is making a silence gesture. Using ultrasonic sensors in battery powered versions of the smart hazard detector is particularly advantageous because ultrasonic sensors consumer very little power. The ultrasonic sensors work by sending out pulses and then calculating the time interval between sending the pulse and receiving the echo to determine the distance to an object. In some embodiments a single piezo of the ultrasonic sensor sends the pulse and receives the echo. In other embodiments separate piezos send pulses and receive echoes.

During normal operation the ultrasonic sensors of the smart hazard detector are merely performing occupancy sensing functions. For example they are determining whether the room is occupied. When performing this function the ultrasonic sensors have a ping rate of about one hertz. This low ping rate is designed to preserve battery power while still effectively perform occupancy detection. However when one of the other sensors such as the smoke fire or carbon monoxide sensors activates the alarm the smart hazard detector increases the ping rate such as up to twenty hertz. The increased ping rate better enables detection of silence gestures which are only made when the alarm is activated. When detecting a silence gesture the ultrasonic sensors are looking for an object such as a human hand to remain within in a predefined distance from the smart hazard detector for a specified period.

An example silence gesture will be described with references to . As shown in at block an occupant is standing in room while an alarm in hazard detector is active and making a BEEP sound. A light such as an LED is provided on an outer portion of the smart hazard detector such that the occupant can see the light when it is turned on. The operation of the light will be described with reference to . Suffice to say for the light is turned off in blocks through . As shown at block the occupant has walked to a position closer to the smart hazard detector which is mounted out of reach on the ceiling of the room. As shown at block the occupant walked to a position even closer to the smart hazard detector such that the occupant is almost directly under the smart hazard detector . As shown at arrow of block the occupant while standing almost directly under the smart hazard detector is beginning to extend an arm upward toward the smart hazard detector .

Referring now to block of the arm of the occupant is extended upward toward the smart hazard detector while the occupant is standing almost directly under the smart hazard detector . After an alarm sounds and the pulse rate increases the ultrasonic sensor the smart hazard detector looks for a trigger to the silence gesture period which is the amount of time the silence gesture must be maintained to deactivate the alarm. According to some embodiments the trigger is a distance change from a baseline and to deactivate the alarm the distance change must be maintain for the entire silence gesture period e.g. three seconds . For example if the baseline is a distance between the sensor and the floor of the room then the sensor is looking for an object to come in between it and the floor thereby changing the distance measured by the pulse. In some embodiments the distance change must be significant enough to ensure that someone is close and likely intends to silence the alarm. For example if the distance to the floor is ten feet then the requisite distance change could be eight feet or eighty percent of the original distance. As such the object would be required to be within two feet of the sensor to trigger the silence gesture period and to deactivate the alarm the object must remain there for the duration of the period. The requisite distance change can be configured based on the height of the ceiling and based on the height of the occupants among other things.

Referring still to block the light is turned on when the occupant successfully triggers the silence gesture period thereby signaling to the occupant to remain in the position for the requisite period such as three seconds. Here the hand of the occupant triggered the silence gesture period. A tolerance is built in such that if the occupant slightly moves and loses but quickly regains the signal the silence gesture period will continue without having to start over. As shown in block the occupant kept the hand in within the requisite distance of the sensor for the duration of the silence gesture period and thus the alarm has been deactivated the BEEP has stopped and the light has turned off. As shown at blocks and the occupant can walk away from the smart hazard detector and resume normal activity.

It should be appreciated that in the event the smart hazard detector is of a design that receives reliable power from the wiring of the home rather than being batter powered a CCD chip could be used to detect the silence gesture . However such an arrangement is not suitable for battery powered hazard detectors because the CCD chips and associated processing consume a large amount of power and would quickly drain the battery. Other possible alternatives to ultrasonic sensors include passive IR sensors thermopile e.g. thermo cameras laser distance measuring laser and a camera combination because camera looks for dot instead of time of arrival dopler shift and a full on camera and image processing system.

According to some embodiments to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of the silence gesture the ultrasonic sensor could work in concert with one or more optical sensors to make the sensing even better. For example when an occupant attempts to silence by placing a hand in field the optical sensor will sense the presence of the occupant s hand and thereby trigger the silence gesture period. The ultrasonic sensor could also work in concert with the optical sensor after the silence gesture period has been triggered where the ultrasonic sensor detects the occupant s changing hand distance and the optical sensor detects the occupant s changing hand distance using proximity and heat techniques.

According to some embodiments the ultrasonic sensor could work in concert with the passive IR sensor. For example when an occupant attempts to silence by placing a hand in field the passive IR will sense this and thereby trigger the silence gesture period. The ultrasonic sensor could also work in concert with the thermopile e.g. thermo camera where both distance change and heat are used to detect the silence gesture. For example the thermo camera detects when human hand is nearby and triggers the silence gesture period. Further the ultrasonic sensor could work in concert with the ambient light sensor. For example when the places a hand in the field and blocks light then the ambient light sensor know the occupant is nearby and thus triggers the silence gesture period.

It should be appreciated that according to embodiments similar gesture controls can be applied to other smart devices in the home such as to the smart thermostat the smart wall switches etc. For example there can be gestures for increasing or decreasing temperature controls for turning on and off lights HVAC etc.

Turning now to an illustration is provided of an exemplary embodiment of a smart doorbell . According to embodiments an important underlying functionality of the smart doorbell is to serve as a home entryway interface unit providing a doorbell functionality or other visitor arrival functionality audio visual visitor announcement functionality and like functionalities. Like the smart hazard detector described above with reference to the smart doorbell is further enhanced with network connectedness and a variety of multi sensing capabilities to accommodate additional functionalities and there can be substantial overlap integration among the smart doorbell the smart hazard detector the smart wall switch and the smart wall plug that leverages their combined processing sensing and communications capabilities as well as their access to cloud based control and intelligence.

In some embodiments the smart doorbell is connected to the wiring of the smart home environment . For example as is common in many homes a 24V low voltage wire is provided at the outer entry points of the home such as at the front back and side doors. The smart doorbell can be connected to this 24V low voltage wire to obtain steady and reliable power. However it should be appreciated that the smart doorbell could include a battery for the purpose of replacing or supplementing power obtained from the home wiring. In some embodiments the battery could be a rechargeable battery such as a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery for extracting power as needed from the house wiring e.g. 24V low voltage wire . For example the smart doorbell could charge the battery during time intervals in which the doorbell s power usage is less than what the 24V low voltage wire can safely provide and that will discharge to provide the needed extra electrical power during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is greater than what the 24V low voltage wire can safely provide. Thus the rechargeable battery could be used as a conventional back up source or as a reservoir to supply excess DC power if needed for short periods.

As illustrated in according to some embodiments the smart doorbell includes two parts a head unit and a backplate which is also referred to as a docking station . This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the wall switches by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. As with the wall switches and the hazard detectors this bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the smart doorbells by making them a modular platform. The docking station is a permanent interface box that serves as a physical connection into area near the entry way such as a doorframe or outer wall of the home and to the voltage wires of the home. According to some embodiments the head unit sometimes referred to herein as replacement module actually contains all of the sensors processors user interfaces the rechargeable battery and so forth. Users can plug and unplug the unit in and out of the docking station . Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the docking station . There are also many different versions for the head unit such as an low cost versions with few features and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units with a large number of features. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station . This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for the front door for example can replaced by a great new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed to a back or basement door etc. When first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select front door or back door and so forth.

Sensors devices such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion ultrasound CCD video camera bar code scanner etc as well as I O devices such as speakers user interfaces 2D 3D projectors etc are provided in the head unit . The sensors and I O devices are generally represented at .

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as are used to detect when packages are delivered to the door of the smart home environment and to take a variety of automated actions in response. According to some embodiments the sensors can see the uniform of the delivery person approaching the door or the truck of the delivery person or the sensors can hear the truck in combination with a person approaching the door within a period after hearing the truck. Once the person is with a predetermined distance from the door the smart doorbell using its speaker asks the person is he or she is a delivery person to which that person can reply with an audible response or by indicating as such on the user interface of the doorbell. If the person is making a delivery the doorbell can instruct the person to place the package in a location proximate the doorbell such that its scanner can scan the bar code or other type of identifying tag affixed to or associated with the package being delivered.

According to embodiments a central server such as server can use the bar code to obtain information about the package such as the sender recipient a description of the item therein whether signature is required etc. Based on this information the rules based inferences engines or artificial intelligence can make inference regarding which action to take next. For example if occupants or more particularly if the specified recipient or recipients are in the home and the package is from a sender or contains an item that is of particular interest to the one or more the occupants an announcement can be made in the home indicating the package is currently being dropped off and providing details about the package. On the other hand the sender or item is not of particular interest to one of the occupants based on the occupants past responses to receiving such deliveries then no announcement will be made and the occupants can discover the package in due course. Similarly if no occupants are home but an inference is made that the package is of particular interest to one of the occupants a text message email phone call etc can be made the one or more identified occupants indicating that the package in being delivered.

According to embodiments in the event signature is required for the package but none of the occupants are home an inference is made to not disturb the occupants the smart doorbell can provide authorization to leave the package. For example the doorbell presents an authorization code either in plain text barcode or encrypted forms on its user interface and prompts the delivery person to use his or her handheld device to record scan photograph or otherwise acquire the authorization code. Once the authorization code has been acquired by the delivery person the doorbell can then instruct the delivery person regarding where to leave the package such as at the front door around the back of the house in a discrete location etc.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors such as noise motion and or facial recognition detection in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as server are used to detect when one or more unknown individuals are approaching the home. A number of learned inferences can be made in this situation. For example during late evening hours an alarm will be sounded in the house giving notice of the approaching person and or the doorbell may audibly announce to the individual that he or she is being monitored by a home security system. Further in the event the person attempts to enter a door window or other access point to the home an message will be sent to local law enforcement. However during day time hours when one or more occupants are at home a learned inference can be made to take no action such as when a meter reader mail carrier garbage collector etc is approaching the house as per a reasonably predictable and learned schedule.

According to embodiments the smart doorbell provides a context based entry keypad. In some examples the entry keypad can be projected such as via a 2D 3D holographic projection. In other examples the entry keypad can be rendered on a display such a 2D LCD display. Persons standing proximate to the smart doorbell can enter a code into the keypad to obtain access to the smart home environment . According to embodiments the occupants of the home get context based keypads and or access code. For example the parents get a more sophisticated keypad that provides a variety of controls whereas children get a simple keypad into which they can enter their access code. Further non occupants get context based keypad too. For example a deliver person gets one keypad whereas uncategorized individuals get another keypad. According to some embodiments the keypad can vary based on factors such as time of day current news e.g. any recent crime in the neighborhood proximity of security guards and other law enforcement personnel and which if any occupants are currently at home. For example if there is a nearby security guard then the keypad requests a three digit access code or no access code at all rather than the usual ten digit access code. In another example if no one is home or if only children or elderly people are at home then a ten digit code is required. However if the parents of the children or the adult children of the elderly are at home then no access code is required or only a three digit code is required. If the approaching person is identified as a guest then the keypad prompts the guest to entry the guest access code assigned to him or her. It should also be appreciated that individuals are prompted to input their access code as the leave the home too. This way the codes of the guests the occupants and recognize categories of strangers e.g. delivery person can be used to track the goings and comings of those people. It should be appreciated that this keypad can be provided on any smart device in the home such as the wall switch the thermostat hazard detector and the wall plug .

According to embodiments when the central server such as server based on information received from the doorbell such as noise and motion data determines that the street adjacent to the home has a threshold level of traffic the inferences are made regarding the safety of the children residing at the home. For example an alarm can be triggered in the home in the event one or more of the children are detected by the occupancy sensing to be outside of the home. This alert enables the parents or other caretakers to quickly take actions to protect the child from the traffic. Further for example automatic adjustments are made to audio equipment in the home of account for the increased traffic noise such as by increasing the volume a proportionate amount.

As discussed the sensors may include temperature and humidity sensors the data from which may be used for a number of useful services. For example the outside humidity and temperature data is consider by the thermostat when controlling the HVAC to best accomplish the occupants desired comfort preferences. Further for example this information may be presented to the occupants through a number of user interfaces such as a user interface associated with another one of the devices located inside of the home the television mobile and other computing devices or audibly. In some instances a central server such as server collects this information from a plurality of smart home across a plurality of geographic locations. This aggregated data may be sold to weather services or may be used to provide weather data to smart home occupants.

According to embodiments the smart doorbell includes a button that upon being touched depressed or otherwise activated causes as audible notification to be broadcasted within the home or a message to be sent to user interfaces of devices within the home or to a mobile device associated with occupants of the home. Learned inferences can be made regarding the appropriate response to activation of the button . For example the audible notification is only broadcast in occupied rooms or rooms occupied by one or more occupants who have a relationship with the person at the door or no alarm is sound in rooms where occupants such as small children are determined to be sleeping. Also for example the occupant selected songs such as uploaded MP3 s may be broadcasts in the home where different songs may be broadcast for different occupants at home at the time or based on the identity of the person at the door. Further for example technologies and sensors at the smart doorbell may identify the person based on facial recognition or based on other characteristics such as the manner in which the person approached the door. For example over time based on input received from the smart doorbell a central server can build up an address book of profile data about people who approach the door such as some identifying biometric data. For example the address book can be built over time using low resolution data such as ultrasonic passive IR etc to create a unique signature for individuals. This combined data from different domains and becomes almost like a fingerprint regarding how that person approaches the house. In some instances when a familiar person approaches the door the smart doorbell asks the person if he is John Doe to which the person can verbally or physically respond. Upon obtaining this information John Doe s name or image can be announced or projected on device in the home and or John Doe will be given certain access rights to the home such as for example the door will automatically unlock as he approaches. Further in addition to or instead of identification based on these unique signatures individuals may enable their mobile devices to communicate with the smart doorbell such as via BLUETOOTH NFC or other wireless protocols. Also for example individual may swipe their smart phones in front of the smart doorbell s RFID scanner. Upon identifying the individual the smart doorbell may give the individual certain access right to the home such as by automatically unlocking the door.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as server also make learned

Turning now to an illustration is provided of an exemplary embodiment of a smart wall plug . According to embodiments the smart wall plugs enhance the smart home environment by providing a retrofit wall plug that in addition to maintaining the basic character and purpose of a wall plug incorporates a host of sensing and communication capabilities for enhancing occupant comfort convenience and safety. Much like the smart wall switches by virtue of being mounting in place of traditional wall plugs the smart wall plugs have access to plentiful electrical operating power such as by connecting to wiring e.g. to 120V hot line voltage wires that is located behind the walls of the smart home environment and that is present at virtually all standard home wall plugs. This unlimited power budget the numerous installation locations throughout the home and the reasonably ample physical space in its housing to fit the necessary components combine to enable the smart wall plugs to accommodate a rich and wide variety of sensing and communications capabilities for the smart home environment as well as a general platform for the provision of even newer sensing and communications hardware as it becomes available. In addition to numerous installation locations inside the home there are numerous outdoor locations outside of the home too. For example smart wall plugs may may be mounted on the outside surface of external walls of the smart home environment and thereby may connect to the same wiring e.g. to 120V hot line voltage wires as do the indoor wall plugs.

A rich variety of new interactions are made possible between the smart wall plugs and other devices of the smart home environment . Occupancy motion or presence sensing for example can be enhanced by virtue of the numerous installation locations of wall plugs inside and outside of the home albeit some of these locations are hidden behind furniture or in locations where people are unlikely to go. According to embodiments the smart wall plugs can include all or some of the components that are included in the wall switch as illustrated in . For example the smart wall plugs can be comprised of two primary parts a head unit and a docking station which is a permanent interface box that serves as a physical connection into the wall and to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment . This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the smart wall plugs by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. According to embodiments the head unit contains the sensors processors the I O devices and receptacles and so forth. Users can upgrade and or redistribute wall plug functionality throughout the home by plugging and unplugging head units of varying capabilities in and out of the docking stations in various locations throughout the home. For example to enhance security of the smart home environment head units having advanced motion sensing capabilities can be plugged into docking stations located in areas having clear lines of sight to entry points such as doorways and windows. Further these head units can be plugged into docking stations location in areas having clear lines of sight in commonly occupied rooms rather than behind furniture in or unused rooms. As discussed these head units may be capable of wirelessly communicating detected motion and can therefore serve as a tripwire for the home security system either inside the home or outside the home. For example smart wall plugs located outside the home such as on external walls near windows and doors provide outdoor tripwires that alert the central server or cloud computing system to the presence of intruders before unwelcome entry into the home even occurs.

According to some embodiments the head unit includes a standard duplex receptacle having upper and lower outlets each having three slots. The head unit further contains some or all of a main processor storage audio speaker microphone power converter GPS receiver RFID locater etc. Additionally the head unit may include wireless and wired networking. In view of the ample power availability a variety of communications capabilities can be provided including Wi Fi ZigBee 3G 4G wireless CAT6 wired Ethernet and even optical fiber from the curb. According to embodiments the smart wall plugs are spokesman nodes in the mesh network described above. For example the smart wall plugs regularly send out messages regarding what they are sensing and in addition to sending out their own messages the smart wall plugs repeat messages from other smart devise in the mesh network thereby causing the messages to travel from node to node i.e. smart device to smart device throughout the smart home environment . As spokesman nodes in the smart home environment the smart wall plugs are able to drop down to low powered communication protocols to receive messages from low power nodes translate the messages to other communication protocols and send the translated messages to other spokesman nodes and or the central server or cloud computing system . Thus the smart wall plugs enable the low powered nodes using low power communication protocols to send messages across the entire smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system . For example battery operated smart hazard detectors are able to preserve their limited power resource yet also communicate with the enteral server or could computing system in real time or near real time by sending messages in low power protocols to the wall plugs which repeat the messages in high power protocols which are transmitted to the central server or cloud computing system . According to embodiments the mesh network enables the central server or cloud computing system regularly receive data from all of the smart devices in the home make inferences based on the data and send commands back to individual one of the smart devices to accomplish some of the smart home objectives descried herein.

Furthermore because the smart wall plug can be connected to the home 120V system a HomePlug or other powerline communications capability can be provided See for example illustrations of such components being provided on a wall switch . It should also be appreciated that the smart wall plugs may include sensors such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion ultrasound CCD video camera an ambient light sensor such as a photoresistor or a single pixel sensor that measures light in the room etc.

In some examples the wall plug may include or be associated with a light source having variable intensity and color and can therefore function in a manner similar to the smart nightlight described above. In some embodiments the light source of the wall plug is configured to activate when the ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and or when the occupancy sensor detects a person s presence or movement. The color and intensity of the light source can be adjusted based on information received from sensor of the wall plug or from other smart devices in the smart home environment. For example in the event the central server or cloud computing system triggers an alarm indicating unauthorized intrusion e.g. based on motion detection data received from smart devices in the home the light source associated with the smart wall plugs can be activated. In this example the light sources associated with the wall plugs can emit a high intensity red colored light to indicate that an emergency is occurring and to cause any intruder to leave the home.

According to embodiments the smart wall plugs wirelessly communicate with a central server such as server . Rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as make security related decisions based on data received from the smart wall plugs . For example decisions are made regarding use when to trigger an alarm when to turn on lights when to send a warning to the owner s mobile device or to the neighborhood network. Furthermore the intelligence of the central process can be used for safety. For example the central server can be programmed with safe operating parameters for each application in the smart home and can shutoff power to the appropriate wall plug when the corresponding application deviates from its safe operating parameters. Also for example in the event data from an occupancy sensor on a particular wall plug indicates that a small child is really close the wall plug the central server may shut off power to that plug. Further user can remotely control such as by use of their mobile device the outlets in the home. For example a parent may want to shutoff power to all wall plugs in their child s room or that are outside of the home and there is some risk that a child may be attracted to the plug.

Turning now to illustrations of a smart thermostat are provided according to some embodiments. Unlike many prior art thermostats smart thermostat preferably has a sleek simple uncluttered and elegant design that does not detract from home decoration and indeed can serve as a visually pleasing centerpiece for the immediate location in which it is installed. Moreover user interaction with smart thermostat is facilitated and greatly enhanced over known conventional thermostats by the design of smart thermostat . The smart thermostat includes control circuitry and is electrically connected to an HVAC system such as is shown with unit in . Smart thermostat is wall mounted is circular in shape and has an outer rotatable ring for receiving user input. Smart thermostat is circular in shape in that it appears as a generally disk like circular object when mounted on the wall. Smart thermostat has a large front face lying inside the outer ring . According to some embodiments smart thermostat is approximately 100 mm in diameter.

The outer rotatable ring allows the user to make adjustments such as selecting a new target temperature. For example by rotating the outer ring clockwise the target temperature can be increased and by rotating the outer ring counter clockwise the target temperature can be decreased. The smart thermostat may be configured to receive a plurality of types of inputs by virtue of the rotatable ring such as a scrolling input and a selection input. For example a rotation of the ring may allow a user to scroll through an array of selection options and inwards pressure exerted on the ring inward click may allow a user to select one of the options e.g. corresponding to a particular scroll position .

The outer rotatable ring may include a component that may be physically rotated or in other embodiments a static component that may sense a user s virtual rotation of the ring. For some embodiments the outer rotatable ring may include a touch pad configured to track arcuate motion of a user s finger on the touch pad. The touch pad may comprise e.g. a ring shaped or circular area. In some instances the touch pad includes multiple portions e.g. to detect arcuate motion in a first ring shaped area and to detect tapping in a second inner circular area . Boundaries of a touch pad area may be identified to a user using e.g. visual or tactile cues. For example a ring shaped touchpad area may be indented compared to neighboring areas on the smart thermostat or the area may be a different color than neighboring areas.

For preferred embodiments such as those of in which the outer ring is a continuous loop without fiducial markers one or more advantages are brought about. Thus a user may physically rotate the ring in embodiments in which the ring is configured to be physically rotatable regardless of a starting position of the ring. Further a user may select e.g. a value of a variable e.g. select a particular menu a particular setpoint temperature value etc. by rotating the ring multiple times. This feature may be particularly advantageous as the user does not need not to worry about precise rotations in order to select a desired option.

The front face of the smart thermostat comprises a clear cover that according to some embodiments is polycarbonate and a metallic portion preferably having a number of slots formed therein as shown. According to some embodiments the surface of cover and metallic portion form a common outward arc or spherical shape gently arcing outward and this gentle arcing shape is continued by the outer ring .

Although being formed from a single lens like piece of material such as polycarbonate the cover has two different regions or portions including an outer portion and a central portion . According to some embodiments the cover is painted or smoked around the outer portion but leaves the central portion visibly clear so as to facilitate viewing of an electronic display disposed thereunderneath. According to some embodiments the curved cover acts as a lens that tends to magnify the information being displayed in electronic display to users. According to some embodiments the central electronic display is a dot matrix layout individually addressable such that arbitrary shapes can be generated rather than being a segmented layout. According to some embodiments a combination of dot matrix layout and segmented layout is employed. According to some embodiments central display is a backlit color liquid crystal display LCD . An example of information displayed on the electronic display is illustrated in and includes central numerals that are representative of a current setpoint temperature.

Particular presentations displayed on the electronic display may depend on detected user input. For example one of a plurality of variables e.g. current setpoint temperature versus learning status or variable values e.g. 65 degrees versus 75 degrees may be displayed. The one being displayed may depend on a user s rotation of the outer rotatable ring . Thus for example when the device is configured to display a current setpoint temperature the value being displayed may gradually increase as the user rotates the ring in a clockwise direction. The sign of the change in the displayed temperature may depend on whether the user is rotating the ring in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The speed at which the displayed temperature is changing may depend e.g. in a linear manner on the speed at which the user is rotating the ring.

As described above a displayed characteristic may vary depending on received user input. For example a displayed temperature may increase as a user rotates the outer rotatable ring clockwise or a highlighted indicator may progress across a list of displayed options as the user rotates the ring . Further or additionally user inputs may cause the appearance of new types of information. For example if a user is viewing setpoint temperature options a dramatic clockwise rotation may cause a flashing red symbol to convey an anti environmental message . Thus a relationship may exist between a single type of user input e.g. ring rotation and a change in an active variable e.g. setpoint temperature changes and relationships may further exist between the single type of user input and an inactive variable e.g. an environmental warning flag . The latter relationship may be indirect and depend on a value or change in values of the active variable.

The presentations on the electronic display may depend on one or more types of user input. For example the display may change in a first manner e.g. to show a varying selection option as a user rotates the outer rotatable ring and may change in a second manner e.g. to confirm a selection or default to a menu screen as the user exerts inwards pressure on the outer rotatable ring .

According to some embodiments metallic portion has number of slot like openings so as to facilitate the use of a passive infrared motion sensor mounted therebeneath. The metallic portion can alternatively be termed a metallic front grille portion. Further description of the metallic portion front grille portion is provided in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108. The design of the metallic portion compliments the sleek simple uncluttered and elegant design of smart thermostat while facilitating the integration and operation of sensors located within a housing of the thermostat. In the implementation as illustrated smart thermostat is enclosed by housing with a forward facing surface including the cover and the metallic portion . Some implementations of the housing include a back plate and a head unit. The housing provides an attractive and durable configuration for one or more integrated sensors used by smart thermostat and contained therein. In some implementations the metallic portion may be flush mounted with the cover on the forward facing surface of housing. Together the metallic portion as incorporated in housing does not detract from home or commercial decor and indeed can serve as a visually pleasing centerpiece for the immediate location in which it is located.

The metallic portion is designed to conceal sensors from view promoting a visually pleasing quality of the thermostat yet permitting them to receive their respective signals. Openings in the metallic portion along the forward facing surface of the housing allow signals to pass through that would otherwise not pass through the cover . For example glass polycarbonate or other similar materials used for cover are capable of transmitting visible light but are highly attenuating to infrared energy having longer wavelengths in the range of 10 microns which is the radiation band of operation for many passive infrared PIR occupancy sensors. Notably included in the smart thermostat according to some preferred implementations is an ambient light sensor not shown and an active proximity sensor not shown positioned near the top of the thermostat just behind the cover . Unlike PIR sensors the ambient light sensor and active proximity sensor are configured to detect electromagnetic energy in the visible and shorter infrared spectrum bands having wavelengths less than 1 micron for which the glass or polycarbonate materials of the cover are not highly attenuating. In some implementations the metallic portion includes openings in accordance with one or more implementations that allow the longer wavelength infrared radiation to pass through the openings towards a passive infrared PIR motion sensor as illustrated. Because the metallic portion is mounted over the radiation receiving surface of PIR motion sensor PIR motion sensor continues to receive the longer wavelength infrared radiation through the openings and detect occupancy in an enclosure.

Additional implementations of the metallic portion also facilitate additional sensors to detect other environmental conditions. The metallic portion may at least partly conceal and or protect one or more such sensors. In some implementations the metallic portion helps a temperature sensor situated inside of the thermostat s housing measure the ambient temperature of air. Openings in the metallic portion promote air flow towards a temperature sensor located below the metallic portion thus conveying outside temperatures to the interior of the housing. In further implementations the metallic portion may be thermally coupled to a temperature sensor promoting a transfer of heat from outside the housing.

The smart thermostat is preferably constructed such that the electronic display is at a fixed orientation and does not rotate with the outer ring so that the electronic display remains easily read by the user. For some embodiments the cover and metallic portion also remain at a fixed orientation and do not rotate with the outer ring . According to one embodiment in which the diameter of the smart thermostat is about 80 mm the diameter of the electronic display is about 45 mm. According to some embodiments an LED indicator is positioned beneath portion to act as a low power consuming indicator of certain status conditions. For example the LED indicator can be used to display blinking red when a rechargeable battery of the thermostat is very low and is being recharged. More generally the LED indicator can be used for communicating one or more status codes or error codes by virtue of red color green color various combinations of red and green various different blinking rates and so forth which can be useful for troubleshooting purposes.

Motion sensing as well as other techniques can be used in the detection and or prediction of occupancy as it is described further in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 430 supra. According to some embodiments occupancy information is used in generating an effective and efficient scheduled program. Preferably an active proximity sensor A is provided to detect an approaching user by infrared light reflection and an ambient light sensor B is provided to sense visible light. The proximity sensor A can be used to detect proximity in the range of about one meter so that the smart thermostat can initiate waking up when the user is approaching the thermostat and prior to the user touching the thermostat. Such use of proximity sensing is useful for enhancing the user experience by being ready for interaction as soon as or very soon after the user is ready to interact with the thermostat. Further the wake up on proximity functionality also allows for energy savings within the thermostat by sleeping when no user interaction is taking place our about to take place. The ambient light sensor B can be used for a variety of intelligence gathering purposes such as for facilitating confirmation of occupancy when sharp rising or falling edges are detected because it is likely that there are occupants who are turning the lights on and off and such as for detecting long term e.g. 24 hour patterns of ambient light intensity for confirming and or automatically establishing the time of day.

According to some embodiments for the combined purposes of inspiring user confidence and further promoting visual and functional elegance the smart thermostat is controlled by only two types of user input the first being a rotation of the outer ring as shown in referenced hereafter as a rotate ring or ring rotation input and the second being an inward push on an outer cap see until an audible and or tactile click occurs referenced hereafter as an inward click or simply click input . For the embodiment of the outer cap is an assembly that includes all of the outer ring cover electronic display and metallic portion . When pressed inwardly by the user the outer cap travels inwardly by a small amount such as 0.5 mm against an interior metallic dome switch not shown and then springably travels back outwardly by that same amount when the inward pressure is released providing a satisfying tactile click sensation to the user s hand along with a corresponding gentle audible clicking sound. Thus for the embodiment of an inward click can be achieved by direct pressing on the outer ring itself or by indirect pressing of the outer ring by virtue of providing inward pressure on the cover metallic portion or by various combinations thereof. For other embodiments the smart thermostat can be mechanically configured such that only the outer ring travels inwardly for the inward click input while the cover and metallic portion remain motionless. It is to be appreciated that a variety of different selections and combinations of the particular mechanical elements that will travel inwardly to achieve the inward click input are within the scope of the present teachings whether it be the outer ring itself some part of the cover or some combination thereof. However it has been found particularly advantageous to provide the user with an ability to quickly go back and forth between registering ring rotations and inward clicks with a single hand and with minimal amount of time and effort involved and so the ability to provide an inward click directly by pressing the outer ring has been found particularly advantageous since the user s fingers do not need to be lifted out of contact with the device or slid along its surface in order to go between ring rotations and inward clicks. Moreover by virtue of the strategic placement of the electronic display centrally inside the rotatable ring a further advantage is provided in that the user can naturally focus their attention on the electronic display throughout the input process right in the middle of where their hand is performing its functions. The combination of intuitive outer ring rotation especially as applied to but not limited to the changing of a thermostat s setpoint temperature conveniently folded together with the satisfying physical sensation of inward clicking together with accommodating natural focus on the electronic display in the central midst of their fingers activity adds significantly to an intuitive seamless and downright fun user experience. Further descriptions of advantageous mechanical user interfaces and related designs which are employed according to some embodiments can be found in U.S. Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra U.S. Ser. No. 29 386 021 supra and U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108.

According to some embodiments the smart thermostat includes a processing system display driver and a wireless communications system . The processing system may be disposed within a housing of smart thermostat coupled to one or more temperature sensors of smart thermostat and or coupled to rotatable ring . The processing system may be configured to dynamically identify user input via rotatable ring dynamically identifying a variable value e.g. a setpoint temperature value and or dynamically identify an HVAC control related property. The processing system may be configured and programmed to provide an interactive thermostat menuing system e.g. such as the menuing system shown in on display area responsive to an inward pressing of rotatable ring and or to provide user navigation within the interactive thermostat menuing system based on rotation of rotatable ring and inward pressing of rotatable ring e.g. such as is described in relation to . The processing system may be adapted to cause the display driver and display area to display information to the user and or to receive user input via the rotatable ring .

For example an active variable e.g. variable value selection setpoint selection zip code selection may be determined based on a default state smart logic or previously received user input. A relationship between the variable and user input may be identified. The relationship may be e.g. linear or non linear continuous or discrete and or saturating or non saturating. Such relationships may be pre defined and stored within the thermostat. User input may be detected. Analysis of the user input may include e.g. identifying a type of user input tapping versus rotation a degree of input e.g. a degree of rotation a final input position e.g. a final angular position of the rotatable ring an input location e.g. a position of a tapping and or a speed of input e.g. a speed of rotation . Using the relationship the processing system may then determine a display indicator such as a digital numerical value representative of an identified value of a variable e.g. a setpoint temperature . The display indicator may be displayed on display area . For example a digital numerical value representative of a setpoint temperature to be displayed may be determined based on a prior setpoint value and a saturating and continuous relationship between rotation input and the temperature. The displayed value may be e.g. numeric textual or graphical.

The processing system may further set a variable value in accordance with a user selection. For example a particular type of user input e.g. inwards pressure exertion may be detected. A value of a selected variable may be determined based on e.g. a prior ring rotation displayed variable value etc. The variable may then be set to this value.

The processing system according to some embodiments is capable of carrying out the governance of the operation of smart thermostat including the user interface features described herein. The processing system is further programmed and configured to carry out other operations as described further hereinbelow and or in other ones of the commonly assigned incorporated applications. For example processing system is further programmed and configured to maintain and update a thermodynamic model for the enclosure in which the HVAC system is installed such as described in U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 463. According to some embodiments the wireless communications system is used to communicate with devices such as personal computers and or other thermostats or HVAC system components which can be peer to peer communications communications through one or more servers located on a private network and or communications through a cloud based service.

It should be appreciated that the smart thermostat could be equipped with a tactile mechanical feedback feature for providing software triggered mechanical feedback to encourage energy efficient user behavior. For example in the event a user attempts to input an ill advised temperature setting e.g. a setting that consumes a large amount of energy the tactile mechanical feedback features provide the user with negative mechanical feedback such as by vibrating making the ring hard or impossible to turn.

Further it should be appreciated that any of the smart devices described herein such as the smart hazard detector the smart thermostat the smart wall switch the smart doorbell could have means for self generating power and optionally storing the generated power in a local battery. For example in some embodiments the smart devices include a Peltier Junction for generating power. In these embodiments for example the Peltier Junction generates electricity from heat differentials created between the smart device and its mounting location such as when the smart device gets hot from use. In other embodiments the smart devices are equipped with generators such as piezoelectric devices that generate electricity when the device is physically used such as when a user turns the ring on the smart thermostat. While piezoelectric devices are used in this example it should be appreciated that any generator devices known to those having skill in the art could be used.

Further included and illustrated in the exemplary smart home environment of are service robots each configured to carry out in an autonomous manner any of a variety of household tasks. For some embodiments the service robots can be respectively configured to perform floor sweeping floor washing etc. in a manner similar to that of known commercially available devices such as the ROOMBA and SCOOBA products sold by iRobot Inc. of Bedford Mass. Tasks such as floor sweeping and floor washing can be considered as away or while away tasks for purposes of the instant description as it is generally more desirable for these tasks to be performed when the occupants are not present. For other embodiments one or more of the service robots are configured to perform tasks such as playing music for an occupant serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant serving as a localized air monitor purifier for an occupant serving as a localized baby monitor serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant and so forth it being generally more desirable for such tasks to be carried out in the immediate presence of the human occupant. For purposes of the instant description such tasks can be considered as human facing or human centric tasks.

When serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant a particular one of the service robots can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal comfort area network for the occupant with the objective being to keep the occupant s immediate space at a comfortable temperature wherever that occupant may be located in the home. This can be contrasted with conventional wall mounted room thermostats which have the more attenuated objective of keeping a statically defined structural space at a comfortable temperature. According to one embodiment the localized thermostat service robot is configured to move itself into the immediate presence e.g. within five feet of a particular occupant who has settled into a particular location in the home e.g. in the dining room to eat their breakfast and read the news . The localized thermostat service robot includes a temperature sensor a processor and wireless communication components configured such that control communications with the HVAC system either directly or through a wall mounted wirelessly communicating thermostat coupled to the HVAC system are maintained and such that the temperature in the immediate vicinity of the occupant is maintained at their desired level. If the occupant then moves and settles into another location e.g. to the living room couch to watch television the localized thermostat service robot proceeds to move and park itself next to the couch and keep that particular immediate space at a comfortable temperature.

Technologies by which the localized thermostat service robot and or the larger smart home system of can identify and locate the occupant whose personal area space is to be kept at a comfortable temperature can include but are not limited to RFID sensing e.g. person having an RFID bracelet RFID necklace or RFID key fob synthetic vision techniques e.g. video cameras and face recognition processors audio techniques e.g. voice sound pattern vibration pattern recognition ultrasound sensing imaging techniques and infrared or near field communication NFC techniques e.g. person wearing an infrared or NFC capable smartphone along with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence techniques that draw useful conclusions from the sensed information e.g. if there is only a single occupant present in the home then that is the person whose immediate space should be kept at a comfortable temperature and the selection of the desired comfortable temperature should correspond to that occupant s particular stored profile .

When serving as a localized air monitor purifier for an occupant a particular service robot can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal health area network for the occupant with the objective being to keep the air quality in the occupant s immediate space at healthy levels. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith other health related functions can be provided such as monitoring the temperature or heart rate of the occupant e.g. using finely remote sensors near field communication with on person monitors etc. . When serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant a particular service robot can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal safety area network for the occupant with the objective being to ensure there is no excessive carbon monoxide smoke fire etc. in the immediate space of the occupant. Methods analogous to those described above for personal comfort area networks in terms of occupant identifying and tracking are likewise applicable for personal health area network and personal safety area network embodiments.

According to some embodiments the above referenced facilitation of personal comfort area networks personal health area networks personal safety area networks and or other such human facing functionalities of the service robots are further enhanced by logical integration with other smart sensors in the home according to rules based inferencing techniques or artificial intelligence techniques for achieving better performance of those human facing functionalities and or for achieving those goals in energy conserving or other resource conserving ways. Thus for one embodiment relating to personal health area networks the air monitor purifier service robot can be configured to detect whether a household pet is moving toward the currently settled location of the occupant e.g. using on board sensors and or by data communications with other smart home sensors along with rules based inferencing artificial intelligence techniques and if so the air purifying rate is immediately increased in preparation for the arrival of more airborne pet dander. For another embodiment relating to personal safety area networks the hazard detector service robot can be advised by other smart home sensors that the temperature and humidity levels are rising in the kitchen which is nearby to the occupant s current dining room location and responsive to this advisory the hazard detector service robot will temporarily raise a hazard detection threshold such as a smoke detection threshold under an inference that any small increases in ambient smoke levels will most likely be due to cooking activity and not due to a genuinely hazardous condition.

The above described human facing and away functionalities can be provided without limitation by multiple distinct service robots having respective dedicated ones of such functionalities by a single service robot having an integration of two or more different ones of such functionalities and or any combinations thereof including the ability for a single service robot to have both away and human facing functionalities without departing from the scope of the present teachings. Electrical power can be provided by virtue of rechargeable batteries or other rechargeable methods with illustrating an exemplary out of the way docking station to which the service robots will automatically dock and recharge its batteries if needed during periods of inactivity. Preferably each service robot includes wireless communication components that facilitate data communications with one or more of the other wirelessly communicating smart home sensors of and or with one or more other service robots e.g. using Wi Fi Zigbee Z Wave 6LoWPAN etc. and one or more of the smart home devices of can be in communication with a remote server over the Internet. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith each service robot can be configured to communicate directly with a remote server by virtue of cellular telephone communications satellite communications 3G 4G network data communications or other direct communication method.

Provided according to some embodiments are systems and methods relating to the integration of the service robot s with home security sensors and related functionalities of the smart home system. The embodiments are particularly applicable and advantageous when applied for those service robots that perform away functionalities or that otherwise are desirable to be active when the home is unoccupied hereinafter away service robots . Included in the embodiments are methods and systems for ensuring that home security systems intrusion detection systems and or occupancy sensitive environmental control systems for example occupancy sensitive automated setback thermostats that enter into a lower energy using condition when the home is unoccupied are not erroneously triggered by the away service robots.

Provided according to one embodiment is a home automation and security system e.g. as shown in that is remotely monitored by a monitoring service by virtue of automated systems e.g. cloud based servers or other central servers hereinafter central server that are in data communications with one or more network connected elements of the home automation and security system. The away service robots are configured to be in operative data communication with the central server and are configured such that they remain in a non away service state e.g. a dormant state at their docking station unless permission is granted from the central server e.g. by virtue of an away service OK message from the central server to commence their away service activities. An away state determination made by the system which can be arrived at i exclusively by local on premises smart device s based on occupancy sensor data ii exclusively by the central server based on received occupancy sensor data and or based on received proximity related information such as GPS coordinates from user smartphones or automobiles or iii any combination of i and ii can then trigger the granting of away service permission to the away service robots by the central server. During the course of the away service robot activity during which the away service robots may continuously detect and send their in home location coordinates to the central server the central server can readily filter signals from the occupancy sensing devices to distinguish between the away service robot activity versus any unexpected intrusion activity thereby avoiding a false intrusion alarm condition while also ensuring that the home is secure. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith the central server may provide filtering data such as an expected occupancy sensing profile triggered by the away service robots to the occupancy sensing nodes or associated processing nodes of the smart home such that the filtering is performed at the local level. Although somewhat less secure it would also be within the scope of the present teachings for the central server to temporarily disable the occupancy sensing equipment for the duration of the away service robot activity.

According to another embodiment functionality similar to that of the central server in the above example can be performed by an on site computing device such as a dedicated server computer a master home automation console or panel or as an adjunct function of one or more of the smart home devices of . In such embodiment there would be no dependency on a remote service provider to provide the away service OK permission to the away service robots and the false alarm avoidance filtering service or filter information for the sensed intrusion detection signals.

According to other embodiments there are provided methods and systems for implementing away service robot functionality while avoiding false home security alarms and false occupancy sensitive environmental controls without the requirement of a single overall event orchestrator. For purposes of the simplicity in the present disclosure the home security systems and or occupancy sensitive environmental controls that would be triggered by the motion noise vibrations or other disturbances of the away service robot activity are referenced simply as activity sensing systems and when so triggered will yield a disturbance detected outcome representative of the false trigger for example an alarm message to a security service or an arrival determination for an automated setback thermostat that causes the home to be heated or cooled to a more comfortable occupied setpoint temperature . According to one embodiment the away service robots are configured to emit a standard ultrasonic sound throughout the course of their away service activity the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard ultrasonic sound and the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard ultrasonic sound is detected. For other embodiments the away service robots are configured to emit a standard notification signal throughout the course of their away service activity the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard notification signal and the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard notification signal is detected wherein the standard notification signal comprises one or more of an optical notifying signal an audible notifying signal an infrared notifying signal an infrasonic notifying signal a wirelessly transmitted data notification signal e.g. an IP broadcast multicast or unicast notification signal or a notification message sent in an TCP IP two way communication session .

According to some embodiments the notification signals sent by the away service robots to the activity sensing systems are authenticated and encrypted such that the notifications cannot be learned and replicated by a potential burglar. Any of a variety of known encryption authentication schemes can be used to ensure such data security including but not limited to methods involving third party data security services or certificate authorities. For some embodiments a permission request response model can be used wherein any particular away service robot requests permission from each activity sensing system in the home when it is ready to perform its away service tasks and does not initiate such activity until receiving a yes or permission granted message from each activity sensing system or from a single activity sensing system serving as a spokesman for all of the activity sensing systems . One advantage of the described embodiments that do not require a central event orchestrator is that there can optionally be more of an arms length relationship between the supplier s of the home security environmental control equipment on the one hand and the supplier s of the away service robot s on the other hand as it is only required that there is the described standard one way notification protocol or the described standard two way request permission protocol to be agreed upon by the respective suppliers.

According to still other embodiments the activity sensing systems are configured to detect sounds vibrations RF emissions or other detectable environmental signals or signatures that are intrinsically associated with the away service activity of each away service robot and are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that particular detectable signal or environmental signature is detected. By way of example a particular kind of vacuum cleaning away service robot may emit a specific sound or RF signature. For one embodiment the away service environmental signatures for each of a plurality of known away service robots are stored in the memory of the activity sensing systems based on empirically collected data the environmental signatures being supplied with the activity sensing systems and periodically updated by a remote update server. For another embodiment the activity sensing systems can be placed into a training mode for the particular home in which they are installed wherein they listen and learn the particular environmental signatures of the away service robots for that home during that training session and thereafter will suppress disturbance detected outcomes for intervals in which those environmental signatures are heard.
