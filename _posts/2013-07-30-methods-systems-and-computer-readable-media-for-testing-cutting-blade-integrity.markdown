This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 677 456 filed Jul. 30 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant Nos. 98 34158 5872 and 2010 34158 20777 awarded by USDA NIFA. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The subject matter described herein relates to testing cutting tools. More particularly the subject matter described herein relates to methods systems and computer readable media for testing cutting blade integrity.

Cutting instruments such as saws have blades that rotate reciprocate or oscillate at high speeds. Some blades include tips that are brazed onto teeth which are part of the main blade body. In use a blade can lose one or more of the tips. Because blades are expensive rather than discarding blades that have lost one or more tips the blades are often retipped by brazing new tips onto the saw body to replace the damaged or missing tips. Used blade tips can also be resharpened by grinding the tips.

Because blades operate at high speeds it is desirable to test the integrity of blades before putting the blades into operation either after initial manufacturing or after retipping or resharpening. Visual inspection may detect large imperfections in cutting blades. However visual inspection may fail to detect some imperfections in the cutting blade such as microcracks or other imperfections that are not visible without magnification. Even with magnification and the use of fluorescent dye microcracks may not be detectable. Microcracks may be caused by excessive heat in the brazing process. Insufficient heat or insufficient flux may also cause poor or weak braze joints. Currently there is no known standard method for testing cutting blade integrity.

Accordingly there exists a need for methods systems and computer readable media for testing cutting instrument integrity.

A system for evaluating integrity of a cutting blade includes at least one stress wave generator for generating at least one stress wave in a cutting blade under test. A sensor detects a signal generated by the at least one stress wave. An integrity analyzer coupled to the sensor determines an indication of integrity of the cutting blade based on at least one characteristic of the signal.

The subject matter described herein can be implemented in software in combination with hardware and or firmware. For example the subject matter described herein can be implemented in software executed by a processor. In one exemplary implementation the subject matter described herein can be implemented using a non transitory computer readable medium having stored thereon executable instructions that when executed by the processor of a computer control the processor to perform steps. Exemplary non transitory computer readable media suitable for implementing the subject matter described herein include chip memory devices or disk memory devices accessible by a processor programmable logic devices and application specific integrated circuits. In addition a computer readable medium that implements the subject matter described herein may be located on a single computing platform or may be distributed across plural computing platforms.

As will be described in detail below cutting blades such as cutting blade may include tips that are connected to the blade body using braze joints. It is desirable to test the integrity of the braze joints. Accordingly a stress wave generator may be used to generate stress waves in the cutting blade. In one example stress wave generator comprises an electrode that generates a spark and the spark creates the stress wave in cutting blade . In other examples stress wave generator may be a laser or a microhammer. In examples where stress wave generator is an electrode a transformer a switch and a power supply may be used to generate the voltage necessary to achieve the spark. Transformer may be a step up transformer with a turn ratio sufficient to generate the necessary break down voltage for generating a spark when the electrode is at a desired distance from cutting blade . In one example transformer comprises an ignition coil similar to that used in an ignition system of an automobile. Switch may be any suitable electrical mechanical or electro mechanical switch for making and breaking the connection between power supply and transformer . Power supply may be any suitable power supply for supplying a voltage to the primary side of transformer . In one example power supply comprises a 12 Volt DC power supply.

In order to determine a measure of integrity of cutting blade a sensor is coupled to cutting blade . In one exemplary setup sensor comprises a contact acousto ultrasonic AU sensor which is placed on a magnet and the magnet is attached to cutting blade or to a fixture to which cutting blade is attached. In another example sensor may be an undamped acoustic emission sensor or a piezoelectric sensor. If a laser is used to generate the stress wave in cutting blade sensor may be a laser interferometer. In yet another alternative arrangement a spark may be used to generate the stress wave in cutting blade and sensor may be a laser interferometer for measuring one or more characteristics of the stress wave.

AU sensor detects an acousto ultrasonic signal generated by the stress wave. An amplifier may be included to amplify the signal output from AU sensor . An analog to digital A D converter converts the amplified signal into digital format that is input into a computer. The interface with the computer may be a USB interface or other suitable interface through which signal data can be passed. In addition amplifier A D converter and at least some signal extraction circuitry may be integrated in a single unit that processes the signal before inputting the signal into a computer. An integrity analyzer analyzes the digitized signal to determine a metric of blade integrity. In one example integrity analyzer compares a signal from a stress wave generated by origination of a stress wave on a tip of cutting blade to a signal generated by origination of a stress wave of a region of cutting blade adjacent to a tip. Based on the results of the comparison integrity analyzer may output an indication of cutting blade integrity.

Fixture may be included for holding cutting blade . In one example fixture comprises a stationary structure and stress wave generator is movable with respect to fixture . In another example fixture may be movable to allow movement of cutting blade relative to stress wave generator . For example fixture may allow rotation of cutting blade relative to stress wave generator or movement in the X and Y directions in a plane parallel to a plane of cutting blade . Fixture may also allow for cutting blades with variable size central apertures. In one implementation fixture may be a conic structure for holding cutting blades of different inner aperture or arbor hole diameters.

In the example illustrated in a single stress wave generator is illustrated. However the subject matter described herein is not limited to using a single stress wave generator. Multiple stress wave generators located at different locations relative to cutting blade may be used to generate stress waves on cutting blade without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein. In addition stress wave generator may be mounted on a movable structure such as an arm having a joint to allow positioning of stress wave generator relative to cutting blade .

In one implementation the system illustrated in may be a bench testing unit suitable for use in manufacturing or cutting blade retipping operations. In another example the system illustrated in may be implemented as a hand held unit where stress wave generator and sensor are located in the hand held unit.

As stated above the system illustrated in may be used to generate an indication of cutting tool integrity. illustrate an exemplary method for generating a stress wave in cutting tool and determining the measure of cutting tool integrity. In stress wave generator comprises an electrode that applies a spark to a tip of cutting tool . In electrode applies a spark to a region of cutting tool adjacent to tip . AU sensor may receive signals corresponding to the stress waves generated by the electrode in . In one example the frequency components in a signal for a braze joint being tested may be compared with the frequency components of a reference signal. The relative lack of frequency components in between the signal waveforms may indicate the presence of a discontinuity such as a microcrack. In another example a relative decrease in signal amplitude may indicate the presence of a microcrack or other defect. In yet another example a signal that decays more rapidly than a reference signal may indicate the presence of an imperfection. These or other parameters may be used together and in combination with other parameters to detect the presence of an imperfection such as a bad braze joint. In one example signal parameters may be averaged and the average of the parameters may indicate the presence of a bad braze joint. Accordingly by analyzing the frequency components amplitude decay rates and or other parameters of the resulting AU waveform or waveforms integrity analyzer may determine the presence of a microcrack or other imperfection in a cutting blade.

In one example the test procedure consists of sending a stress wave through the saw body just behind the saw tooth and then another stress wave through the saw tooth and the saw body. Features of each waveform are extracted and analyzed. These can include but not limited to the energy of the waveform the RMS root mean square of the waveform the average frequency the centroid frequency the rise time and the waveform duration to name a few.

A ratio is then established between the waveform feature for the stress wave going through the tooth and saw body with the same waveform feature for the stress wave going through just the saw body behind the saw tooth. This is repeated for all the teeth on the saw and then compared with the values obtained from a saw known to be of good quality.

These types of ratios reduce the effect of coupling differences of the sensor between the saw bodies as well as the difference between positions of the teeth around the saw body and how close a tooth is to a slot or hole in the saw body. The energy ratio for the two waveforms in may be calculated as follows 

It will be understood that various details of the subject matter described herein may be changed without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation as the subject matter described herein is defined by the claims as set forth hereinafter.
