The present disclosure relates generally to computer networks software applications and cloud computing networks.

Cloud computing allows applications to be executed on various computers or nodes of a computing network. Computer programmers write programs to build applications for nodes in a cloud network. Existing cloud platforms focus on machines and servers. Building an application for a cloud network requires a specific application configuration for a node including the location and resources of the node. Application creation in this environment is not easily separated from the configuration and maintenance details. Having to program for specific application configurations adds an extra layer of complexity for the user and limits the ability to install and execute applications in a dynamic cloud environment.

According to an embodiment of the disclosure an application term of a declarative programming language is obtained for building an application to be executed on a node in a node network. The node network may be a cloud network of on premise and or remote nodes. The application term is independent of an application configuration for the application prior to compilation of the application term and the application configuration is associated with the application at execution time of the application term. A resource term of the declarative programming language is obtained for preparing a resource for the application. The resource term is independent of the application configuration prior to compilation of the resource term and the application configuration prepares the resource of a selected node of the node network for the application at execution time of the resource term. An action term of the declarative programming language is obtained for performing an action of the application. The action term is independent of the application configuration prior to compilation of the action term. A task term of the declarative programming language is obtained for performing a task of the action wherein the task term is independent of the application configuration prior to compilation of the task term.

The application term the resource term the action term and the task term may be provided to a user for programming an application on a computing device. The application term the resource term the action term and the task term may be received in a memory of a computing device. The terms may be compiled as syntax keywords of the declarative programming language. The terms may be executed to carry out instructions to build the application.

According to an embodiment the application configuration is associated with the application at the execution time of the application term based on the selected node.

In a further embodiment the resource for the application is prepared on the selected node at the execution time of the resource term based on the application configuration. The resource may be allocated to the selected node.

According to another embodiment a unique application variable is generated for the application at the execution time of the application term wherein the unique application variable introduces application specific values into the application configuration of the respective application on the selected node at the execution time of the application term.

Also a second unique application variable may be generated for a second application on the selected node of a same type as the application and wherein the application and the second application may be executed on the selected node simultaneously.

Accordingly aspects of the present disclosure may be implemented as entirely hardware entirely software including firmware resident software micro code etc. or combined software and hardware implementation that may all generally be referred to herein as a circuit module component or system. Furthermore aspects of the present disclosure may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable media having computer readable program code embodied thereon.

Existing cloud platforms focus on machines and require an application configuration to be specified ahead of time before installation or execution of the application on a specified node. shows system with a cloud network of nodes to . A typical application programming interface is concerned with identifying the specific node to be utilized by an application. A user has to ask whether there is a machine with Resource A. Window is focused on specifying up front in the build programming language application configuration information such as where the node is located and how the application will be configured with the resources of the node.

Application configurations usually involve preparing or allocating resources and configuring the application to use the resources. An application configuration may involve setting its name creating a user uploading a database or other affirmative steps to prepare a specified node and its resources for an application. A typical installation may require downloading an application package locating systems database and web server to install the package on installing a database and web server software installing the application package configuring the application package and testing the installation. This adds complexity and additional hurdles for an application user or system administrator. A user may have an application the user wishes to create and would prefer a high level straightforward way to build the application and have it executed within a large and dynamic network of resources.

Various embodiments described herein provide a programming language for building deploying scaling maintaining and or testing applications based in a cloud network whether on premise host computers and or remote host computers. Applications may be written and built to be configured with resources in real time as a result of executing the programming language. At execution application requirements and configuration steps may take advantage of information acquired from earlier configuration steps to make application configuration decisions. Examples of applications that may be built configured tested and executed include managed hosting applications such as Rackspace applications application services such as Amazon Web Services AWS applications portable development environments such as Vagrant applications debugging application such as Bugnet applications issue tracking application such as JIRA applications version control repositories such as Gitlab applications etc. In some regards the programming language may be considered a Domain Specific Language DSL or a language created for a specific purpose.

Various embodiments described herein may be used for constructing cloud applications in a way that is technology agnostic. Technology is generally the foundation on which applications are built but with various embodiments described herein a user need not ask questions such as Do I have a virtual machine with a MySQL database on it or Do I have one with Ruby on it Embodiments of the described declarative programming language can take care of these issues and cause a computer system or application manager to make relevant decisions for the programmer and or user.

There are many features of the language described in the embodiments. From the viewpoint of the programmer the language is server agnostic. The language may isolate the building of applications from understanding specific machines. It does not require that the programmer understand where resources servers or virtual machines are currently allocated in order to define actions around all aspects of an application s life cycle.

Rather than specifying machines a programmer can specify resources that will be used with the application. In many cases the resources are necessary for an application. Resources can include among others a database e.g. MySQL database MSSQL database PostreSQL database an application server e.g. J2EE server Tomcat server NodeJS server Ruby on Rails server and or other supporting infrastructure or services such as a message queue or a transaction server. The language when executed will utilize or allocate resources as necessary depending on nodes that are available at the time of execution. This generates configuration information about those resources.

The programming language may use application configuration information that is stored or captured in a separate process to drive application configuration. For example a virtual host may be allocated setting up DNS and an HTTP proxy so the application can be reached by the world. Network ports can be allocated. A port can be reserved and saved in the application configuration file. Application configuration files can be modified using information from previous steps. Files can be copied to various resources. Shell code can be executed often with application configuration information.

Some configuration information may be abstracted from installation information. If the application or same type of application is installed elsewhere those instructions as to how to set up the same application package can be accessed at execution time and used for configuration.

According to the embodiment in users and or administrators may use application execution manager to build test compile install execute and or otherwise handle applications. Application may be built for installation or execution on nodes of cloud network with application program . No application configuration is required to be specified in application program prior to compilation and execution. Application execution manager will associate an application configuration with Application based on a selection from nodes when application program is executed. A node may be selected at or near the time of execution. According to some embodiments installation details may be used to develop application configurations.

Each node may have certain resources prepared for the application. In some cases resources may be allocated to selected nodes. These resources may also be specified in application program .

Application program illustrates Application Term which represents a language component used to build high level application object Application . Application represents the application and the lifecycle of the application. One or more resources needed by the application such as Resource may be prepared for Application using Resource Term . A resource may be a database and or some software stack that provides functionality required by the application. At this time no application configuration specific to a node is necessary. This can be advantageous as the nodes in a network or cloud and their configurations may change between now and the time of execution.

Next actions can be defined for different lifecycle events such as install backup and or restore. Action Term may be used for creating Action . Within each action various tasks can be defined such as allocating a port copying a file from the package file executing a shell command editing a file etc. Task Terms A C may be used to define Tasks A C.

In block a resource term of the declarative programming language is obtained for preparing a resource for the application. The resource term is independent of the application configuration prior to compilation of the resource term and the application configuration prepares the resource of a selected node of the node network for the application at execution time of the resource term. Resource preparation may involve allocating the resource to one or more nodes of the network.

In block an action term of the declarative programming language is obtained for performing an action of the application. The action term is independent of the application configuration prior to compilation of the action term. Actions may be written before knowing the information from the application configuration.

In block a task term of the declarative programming language is obtained for performing a task of the action wherein the task term is independent of the application configuration prior to compilation of the task term. In some cases any combination and or subcombination of terms may be used.

In block the terms are executed. Execution may involve carrying out instructions according to compiled terms to build install carry out update modify and or remove the application. Other application lifecycle operations not listed here may be performed for the application. The application configuration is associated with the application and the application is built on one or more nodes to be ready for use.

In block resources for the application are prepared for the application at the time the resource term is executed. In many embodiments resources are allocated to the selected node or nodes. Resources may be identified configured and or allocated as part of the application configuration. As the language proceeds step by step the application configuration may build upon previous configuration steps. In some cases values in later steps are replaced or filled with values from previous or earlier steps.

Often existing applications are hard coded to a specific setup. As shown in typical system of while the Operating System A allows Application A it did not allow a user to run Application A on server Operating System A because there is no knowledge of how to separate out shared variables files.

A solution is to use dynamic application variables generated on a per application basis. In an embodiment an application key or appKey A Za z is generated for each application. The application keys may be randomly generated. Application keys may be used to uniquely identify applications and instances of applications. Application keys isolate or shield applications from other applications. The application key described here allows you to introduce application specific values into your application configuration and as a result allows you to make generic what would otherwise be a static variable.

For example shows a process that addresses this problem. In block a unique application variable is generated for the application at the execution time of the application term. The unique application variable introduces application specific values into the application configuration of the respective application on the selected node at the execution time of the application term. Application specific values can include the use of a resource name specified in the application installation step the application key that was generated and the resource type based on the type of resource requested. An installation directory for the application may use the application key in naming. The user associated with the installation may also be named by the application key.

In block a second unique application variable is generated for a second application on the selected node of a same type as the application and wherein the application and the second application may be executed on the selected node simultaneously.

In an embodiment a database is created and named perhaps with the application key e.g. application key specified database name database type . This is a first piece of configuration information. This database would be allocated on a particular node. Application execution manager may provide its own domain name service DNS infrastructure which will allow any application to ask for the IP address behind a named resource. When a DNS query is made for the named database application execution manager may respond with the IP address of the database server that the database is installed upon. This information may be stored in an application configuration record which is a structure containing all configuration information that is known for a particular application.

Once the database is allocated the application obtains instructions for how to use the database. The application configuration file is modified. In some cases the application configuration file associated with the application is opened a database connection string is searched and replaced with the database name and port .

The language provides a template for the application execution manager to follow to install an application. As the language is executed various operations take place to generate configuration information which is then used to fill in data required for other operations in the execution of the application. Such as in the example above until the database is allocated the name of the database and how to communicate with it are missing. Allocating the database will produce sufficient information for the application configuration to configure the application for the database.

Embodiments of the described language are designed with re usability and cleaner programming language statements in mind. In some embodiments the language was designed from the ground up to provide command line and web based requests in almost the same syntax or manner. An example of the language is shown in example code in .

In the example code an application term may be represented by the keyword app which creates the application object. No details of an application configuration need to be specified by the programmer. The language will create the configuration object appData object in the example code to contain the future application specific configuration data. Such configuration data may not be developed until execution time.

The application may need a resource prepared for an application of its type. A resource keyword such as resource term may be used to prepare resources for use by an application. For example allocateResources may be used with pushToNodesWith to prepare whatever nodes are capable or selected to utilize a specified resource. In a further embodiment sample language also allows execution on remote nodes using the resources selected so that applications can be executed in different execution contexts.

Keyword term or appKey represents an application key to be generated for this application so that it is isolated from other applications of the same type. This provides for multi tenant configurations. For example shows system with operating system A with Application A Application A and Application A . These applications may be the same type but are allowed to coexist on operating system A . Application Key A A Application Key A A and Application Key A A are unique identifiers that isolate each application from each other.

In an embodiment application terms for application program may be provided through a browser on a node or computing device. The browser may be any commonly used browser including any multithreading browser.
