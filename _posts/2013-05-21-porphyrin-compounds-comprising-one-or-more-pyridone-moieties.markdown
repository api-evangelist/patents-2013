U.S. Pat. No. 7 259 122 the 122 patent in the name of Lombardi teaches that singlet oxygen may be used to decontaminate a wide variety of pathogens and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The 122 patent further teaches use of a photocatalyst to generate singlet oxygen from ambient oxygen in combination with a singlet oxygen trap.

Referring to molecular oxygen in its ground state contains two unpaired electrons and resides in a triplet spin state. Singlet oxygen is an excited form in which all electrons are paired. This first excited singlet state of oxygen is 22 kcal mol above its ground state. Singlet oxygen is a reactive oxidant. Generation of singlet oxygen by energy transfer from a photosensitizer is shown in .

It is known in the art that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs such as for example diphenylanthracene 1 can reversibly react with singlet oxygen 2 to give endoperoxide adduct 3. Decomposition of these endoperoxides upon heating releases singlet oxygen.

N substituted 2 pyridones 4 have been reported to trap singlet oxygen upon irradiation in the presence of a photosensitizer to give 1 4 endoperoxides 5. Such photosensitizers comprise inter alia substituted porphyrin compounds. These endoperoxides are more efficient in thermally releasing singlet oxygen than the endoperoxide derivatives of PAHs.

Applicants have prepared and studied compound 4 wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of H CH OCH and CH N wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of H and CH wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of H CH OCH and CH N and wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of Ph p CNPh CH CH CH COCHCH OH and COOH. Applicants have found that substituted pyridones 4 comprising electron donating groups Rand Rfacilitate the reaction with singlet oxygen to form endo peroxide 5.

Applicants have prepared a number of compounds comprising both a porphyrin photocatalyst moiety and one or more pyridone singlet oxygen trap moieties. As those skilled in the art will appreciate the vapor pressure of a porphyrin compound is several orders of magnitude less than the vapor pressure of a substituted pyridone 4. Covalently bonding one or more pyridone moieties to a porphyrin compound assures that a desired ratio of singlet oxygen traps to singlet oxygen generators is maintained in a coating solution formulation and the like.

More specifically Applicants have prepared substituted porphyrin compound comprising four 2 pyridone moieties substituted porphyrin compound comprising one 2 pyridone moiety and substituted porphyrin compound comprising two 2 pyridone moieties.

Referring to porphyrin was prepared from starting materials and utilizing three acid catalysts namely BF etherate trifluoroacetic acid TFA and amberlyst ion exchange resin. Referring to tetra pyridone substituted porphyrin was prepared from porphyrin as described hereinbelow.

Referring to porphyrin was prepared from starting materials and utilizing propionic anhydride and propionic acid. shows the H NMR spectrum for porphyrin . Referring to mono and di substituted porphyrins and were prepared from porphyrin and substituted pyridone .

The following Examples are presented to further illustrate to persons skilled in the art how to make and use the invention. These examples are not intended as a limitation however upon the scope of the invention.

A 500 mL round bottom flask containing p bromo methyl benzaldehyde 54 0.6 g 3 mmol and amberlyst resin 4 g was equipped with a Claisen distilling head a dropping funnel and a condenser. All open ends were sealed with rubber septa. The glassware was flame dried under vacuum. Anhydrous chloroform 300 mL was introduced to the flask via septum. Pyrrole 0.25 mL 3.5 mmol was added to the flask by a syringe through septum.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature in the dark under an argon atmosphere for 5 hours. After 10 min addition of pyrrole the solution mixture was light yellow. Solution color changed during 5 hours reaction period from light yellow to orange to red to dark red and dark. DDQ 0.5 g was added to the dark solution. The resulting yellowish dark red solution was allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 hour.

The mixture was neutralized with pyridine and then filtered. The filtrate was collected and concentrated to give black solid residue. The solid residue was analyzed by TLC and H NMR. TLC analysis 100 DCM shows two purple components at Rof 0.9 and 0.5 and a greenish yellow at the base line. The H NMR spectrum CDCl of this solid residue revealed a characteristic porphyrin N H at 2.81. This indicates that this crude solid contained a porphyrin. The solid residue 0.6 g was subjected to a column chromatography 100 DCM . The two purple bands were collected and concentrated to give purple solids 70 mg and 40 mg . The purple solids were analyzed by H NMR.

A 50 mL round bottom flask containing NaH 60 0.012 g 0.3 mmol was equipped with a Claisen distilling head and a condenser. All open ends were sealed with rubber septa. The glassware was flame dried under vacuum. A solution of 2 hydroxypyridine 0.025 g 0.2 mmol in THF anh 7 mL was introduced to the flask by a syringe through septum. The mixture was stirred under argon purge until gas evolution ceased. A solution of the porphyrin 50 mg 0.05 mmol in THF anh 10 mL was introduced to the flask by a syringe through septum. The resulting purple mixture was stirred and heated under an argon atmosphere at refluxing THF for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The mixture was filtered. The solid residue was washed by dichloromethane. The dark purple filtrate was collected and concentrated to give a yellowish purple solid. The solid was washed by MeOH twice to give a purple solid 40 mg . The purple solid was analyzed by H NMR and UV Vis absorption spectroscopy.

The key signal is a singlet at 5.54 8H which corresponds to the methylene protons. If this sample was only a mixture of the porphyrin and 2 pyridone the singlet which is due to the methylene protons of the porphyrin would appear at 4.85. This spectrum clearly shows that the methylene protons resonance shifts downfield to 5.54 which corresponds to the methylene protons attached to a phenyl ring and a nitrogen atom of the pyridone ring as previously observed from N benzyl 2 pyridone. Therefore the H NMR spectrum suggests that this porphyrin is covalently linked to 2 pyridone. No singlet at 4.85 is observed suggesting that 2 pyridone is covalently linked to all four methylene carbons of the porphyrin.

The spectrum reveals that pyridone linkage does not perturb the excited state of the porphyrin. The fluorescence emission of the porphyrin shown in was similar to the emission of T4mPP.

Solutions of the porphyrin and T4mPP were irradiated through a Pyrex or a yellow filter and monitored by UV Vis absorption spectroscopy. The solution was purged with a continuous fine steam oxygen gas during irradiation.

In addition solutions of porphyrin 2.4 mg T4mPP 0.6 mg N benzyl 2 pyridone 10 mg and T4mPP 0.6 mg in CDCl 1 mL were irradiated through a Pyrex filter or a yellow filter. The solutions were purged with a continuous fine steam oxygen gas during irradiation. These solutions were analyzed by H NMR. The final solutions containing pyridone were heated at 50 C. for 30 min and analyzed by H NMR.

Irradiation of diluted solutions of the porphyrin and T4mPP in chloroform through a Pyrex filter results in change of solution color from weak purple to yellow. shows an UV Vis absorption overlay spectrum of the porphyrin solution in chloroform before and after 5 and 15 min of irradiation. shows an UV Vis absorption overlay spectrum of a solution of T4mPP in chloroform before and after 10 min of irradiation. demonstrate that the efficiency of porphyrin as a photocatalyst is not diminished by the presence of the 4 pyridone moieties.

The data of Table 2 were calculated using Equations 1 2 and 3 . Relative ratio of product amount 2 1 in the mixture SM 2integration of 2 2 Percent consumption Relative Ratio Of Product 100 3 

Table 2 shows that 7 is 90 consumed after 50 min of irradiation. By comparison with the irradiation using aluminum phthalocyanine AlPc sensitizer the relative ration of the endoperoxide 8 formation was observed at 0.08 after 160 min of irradiation while in the reaction with T4mPP sensitizer the ratio is 0.99 after 120 min of irradiation. This result indicates that T4mPP is approximately twelve times more effective than AlPc for sensitized singlet oxygen generation.

Curve shows the sample after a first irradiation a first 30 minute heating a second 20 minute irradiation a second 30 minute heating a third 20 minute irradiation and a third 30 minute heating. The solution in curve was further irradiated for 60 min.

After irradiation for 20 min in the first cycle the spectrum reveals the decrease in integrations of the methylene protons and the pyridone ring protons and reveals formation of new proton signals at 4.89 d J 16.0 Hz 5.19 d J 16.0 Hz 5.25 d J 6.0 Hz 5.96 d J 4.8 Hz 6.95 m and 7.01 m .

The two new doublets appear in the region of 4.5 5.5 which are associated with large coupling constants are characteristic absorptions indicating the formation of an endoperoxide derivative formed from singlet oxygen trapping of 2 pyridones. These new signal integrations are decreased after heating at 50 C. for 30 min while the intensities of the methylene protons and pyridone ring protons increase. These results correspond to the previously observed sensitized trapping and thermal reverse releasing singlet oxygen from 2 pyridones.
