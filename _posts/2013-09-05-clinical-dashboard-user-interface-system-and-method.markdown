This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 700 557 entitled Dashboard User Interface System and Method filed on Sep. 13 2012 and is a continuation in part application of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 13 613 980 entitled Clinical Predictive and Monitoring System and Method filed on Sep. 13 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 552 525 entitled Clinical Predictive and Monitoring System and Method filed on Oct. 28 2011 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 700 557 entitled Dashboard User Interface System and Method filed on Sep. 13 2012. All afore mentioned patent applications are herein incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates to a clinical dashboard user interface system and method and in particular in the field of disease identification and monitoring.

One of the challenges facing hospitals today is identifying a patient s primary illness as early as possible so that appropriate interventions can be deployed immediately. Some illnesses such as Acute Myocardial Infarction AMI and pneumonia require an immediate standard action or pathway within 24 hours of the diagnosis. Other illnesses are less acute but still require careful adherence to medium and long term treatment plans over multiple care settings.

The Joint Commission the hospital accreditation agency approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS has developed Core Measures that have clearly articulated process measures. These measures are tied to standards that could result in CMS penalties for poor performance. For example the measures set forth for Acute Myocardial Infarction include 

To date most reporting and monitoring of accountable measure activities are done after the patient has been discharged from the healthcare facility. The delay in identifying and learning about a particular intervention often makes it impossible to rectify any situation. It is also difficult for a hospital administrator to determine how well the hospital is meeting core measures on a daily basis. Clinicians need a real time or near real time view of patient progress and care throughout the hospital stay including clinician notes that will inform actions pathways and monitoring on the part of care management teams and physicians toward meeting these core measures.

Case management teams have difficulty following patients real time disease status. The ability to do this with a clear picture of clinician s notes as they change in real time as new information comes in during a patient s hospital stay would increase the teams ability to apply focused interventions as early as possible and follow or change those pathways as needed throughout a patient s hospital stay increasing quality and safety of care decreasing unplanned readmissions and adverse events and improving patient outcomes. This disclosure describes software developed to identify and risk stratify patients at highest risk for hospital readmissions and other adverse clinical events and a dashboard user interface that presents data to the users in a clear and easy to understand manner.

The data received by the clinical predictive and monitoring system may include electronic medical records EMR that include both clinical and non clinical data. The EMR clinical data may be received from entities such as hospitals clinics pharmacies laboratories and health information exchanges including vital signs and other physiological data data associated with comprehensive or focused history and physical exams by a physician nurse or allied health professional medical history prior allergy and adverse medical reactions family medical history prior surgical history emergency room records medication administration records culture results dictated clinical notes and records gynecological and obstetric history mental status examination vaccination records radiological imaging exams invasive visualization procedures psychiatric treatment history prior histological specimens laboratory data genetic information physician s notes networked devices and monitors such as blood pressure devices and glucose meters pharmaceutical and supplement intake information and focused genotype testing.

The EMR non clinical data may include for example social behavioral lifestyle and economic data type and nature of employment job history medical insurance information hospital utilization patterns exercise information addictive substance use occupational chemical exposure frequency of physician or health system contact location and frequency of habitation changes predictive screening health questionnaires such as the patient health questionnaire PHQ personality tests census and demographic data neighborhood environments diet gender marital status education proximity and number of family or care giving assistants address housing status social media data and educational level. The non clinical patient data may further include data entered by the patients such as data entered or uploaded to a social media website.

Additional sources or devices of EMR data may provide for example lab results medication assignments and changes EKG results radiology notes daily weight readings and daily blood sugar testing results. These data sources may be from different areas of the hospital clinics patient care facilities patient home monitoring devices among other available clinical or healthcare sources.

As shown in patient data sources may include non healthcare entities . These are entities or organizations that are not thought of as traditional healthcare providers. These entities may provide non clinical data that include for example gender marital status education community and religious organizational involvement proximity and number of family or care giving assistants address census tract location and census reported socioeconomic data for the tract housing status number of housing address changes frequency of housing address changes requirements for governmental living assistance ability to make and keep medical appointments independence on activities of daily living hours of seeking medical assistance location of seeking medical services sensory impairments cognitive impairments mobility impairments educational level employment and economic status in absolute and relative terms to the local and national distributions of income climate data and health registries. Such data sources may provide further insightful information about patient lifestyle such as the number of family members relationship status individuals who might help care for a patient and health and lifestyle preferences that could influence health outcomes.

The clinical predictive and monitoring system may further receive data from health information exchanges HIE . HIEs are organizations that mobilize healthcare information electronically across organizations within a region community or hospital system. HIEs are increasingly developed to share clinical and non clinical patient data between healthcare entities within cities states regions or within umbrella health systems. Data may arise from numerous sources such as hospitals clinics consumers payers physicians labs outpatient pharmacies ambulatory centers nursing homes and state or public health agencies.

A subset of HIEs connect healthcare entities to community organizations that do not specifically provide health services such as non governmental charitable organizations social service agencies and city agencies. The clinical predictive and monitoring system may receive data from these social services organizations and social to health information exchanges which may include for example information on daily living skills availability of transportation to doctor appointments employment assistance training substance abuse rehabilitation counseling or detoxification rent and utilities assistance homeless status and receipt of services medical follow up mental health services meals and nutrition food pantry services housing assistance temporary shelter home health visits domestic violence appointment adherence discharge instructions prescriptions medication instructions neighborhood status and ability to track referrals and appointments.

Another source of data include social media or social network services such as FACEBOOK and GOOGLE websites. Such sources can provide information such as the number of family members relationship status identify individuals who may help care for a patient and health and lifestyle preferences that may influence health outcomes. These social media data may be received from the websites with the individual s permission and some data may come directly from a user s computing device as the user enters status updates for example.

These non clinical patient data provides a much more realistic and accurate depiction of the patient s overall holistic healthcare environment. Augmented with such non clinical patient data the analysis and predictive modeling performed by the present system to identify patients at high risk of readmission or disease recurrence become much more robust and accurate.

The system is further adapted to receive user preference and system configuration data from clinicians computing devices mobile devices tablet computers laptop computers desktop computers servers etc. in a wired or wireless manner. These computing devices are equipped to display a system dashboard and or another graphical user interface to present system data and reports. For example a clinician healthcare personnel may immediately generate a list of patients that have the highest congestive heart failure risk scores e.g. top n numbers or top x . The graphical user interface are further adapted to receive the user s healthcare personnel input of preferences and configurations etc. The data may be transmitted presented and displayed to the clinician user in the form of web pages web based message text files video messages multimedia messages text messages e mail messages and in a variety of suitable ways and formats.

As shown in the clinical predictive and monitoring system may receive data streamed real time or from historic or batched data from various data sources. Further the system may store the received data in a data store or process the data without storing it first. The real time and stored data may be in a wide variety of formats according to a variety of protocols including CCD XDS HL7 SSO HTTPS EDI CSV etc. The data may be encrypted or otherwise secured in a suitable manner. The data may be pulled polled by the system from the various data sources or the data may be pushed to the system by the data sources. Alternatively or in addition the data may be received in batch processing according to a predetermined schedule or on demand. The data store may include one or more local servers memory drives and other suitable storage devices. Alternatively or in addition the data may be stored in a data center in the cloud.

The computer system may comprise a number of computing devices including servers that may be located locally or in a cloud computing farm. The data paths between the computer system and the data store may be encrypted or otherwise protected with security measures or transport protocols now known or later developed.

Within 24 hours of a patient s admission to the hospital stored historical and real time data related to the patients are analyzed by the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method to identify specific diseases and conditions related to the patient such as congestive heart failure. Further the system calculates a risk score for congestive heart failure for this particular patient within 24 hours of admission. If this particular patient s risk score for congestive heart failure is above a certain risk threshold then the patient is identified on a list of high risk patients that is presented to an intervention coordination team. The processes for disease identification and risk score calculation are described in more detail below.

The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method are operable to display transmit and otherwise present the list of high risk patients to the intervention coordination team which may include physicians physician assistants case managers patient navigators nurses social workers family members and other personnel or individuals involved with the patient s care. The means of presentment may include e mail text messages multimedia messages voice messages web pages facsimile audible or visual alerts etc. delivered by a number of suitable electronic or portable computing devices. The intervention coordination team may then prioritize intervention for the highest risk patients and provide targeted inpatient care and treatment. The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may further automatically present a plan to include recommended intervention and treatment options. Some intervention plans may include detailed inpatient clinical assessment as well as patient nutrition pharmacy case manager and heart failure education consults starting early in the patient s hospital stay. The intervention coordination team may immediately conduct the ordered inpatient clinical and social interventions. Additionally the plan may include clinical and social outpatient interventions and developing a post discharge plan of care and support.

High risk patients are also assigned a set of high intensity outpatient interventions. Once a targeted patient is discharged outpatient intervention and care begin. Such interventions may include a follow up phone call within 48 hours from the patient s case manager such as a nurse doctors appointment reminders and medication updates outpatient case management for 30 days a follow up appointment in a clinic within 7 days of discharge a subsequent cardiology appointment if needed and a follow up primary care visit. Interventions that have been found to be successful are based on well known readmission reduction programs and strategies designed to significantly reduce 30 day readmissions associated with congestive heart failure.

The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method continue to receive clinical and non clinical data regarding the patient identified as high risk during the hospital stay and after the patient s discharge from the hospital to further improve the diagnosis and modify or augment the treatment and intervention plan if necessary.

After the patient is discharged from the hospital the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method continue to monitor patient intervention status according to the electronic medical records case management systems social services entities and other data sources as described above. The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may also interact directly with caregivers case managers and patients to obtain additional information and to prompt action. For example the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may notify a physician that one of his or her patients has returned to the hospital the physician can then send a pre formatted message to the system directing it to notify a specific case management team. In another example the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may recognize that a patient missed a doctor s appointment and hasn t rescheduled. The system may send the patient a text message reminding the patient to reschedule the appointment.

The data extraction process extracts clinical and non clinical data from data sources in real time or in historical batch files either directly or through the Internet using various technologies and protocols. Preferably in real time the data cleansing process cleans or pre processes the data putting structured data in a standardized format and preparing unstructured text for natural language processing NLP to be performed in the disease risk logic module described below. The system may also receive clean data and convert them into desired formats e.g. text date field converted to numeric for calculation purposes .

The data manipulation process may analyze the representation of a particular data feed against a meta data dictionary and determine if a particular data feed should be re configured or replaced by alternative data feeds. For example a given hospital EMR may store the concept of maximum creatinine in different ways. The data manipulation process may make inferences in order to determine which particular data feed from the EMR would best represent the concept of creatinine as defined in the meta data dictionary and whether a feed would need particular re configuration to arrive at the maximum value e.g. select highest value .

The data integration logic module then passes the pre processed data to a disease risk logic module . The disease risk logic module is operable to calculate a risk score associated with an identified disease or condition for each patient and identifying those patients who should receive targeted intervention and care. The disease risk logic module includes a de identification re identification process that is adapted to remove all protected health information according to HIPAA standards before the data is transmitted over the Internet. It is also adapted to re identify the data. Protected health information that may be removed and added back may include for example name phone number facsimile number email address social security number medical record number health plan beneficiary number account number certificate or license number vehicle number device number URL all geographical subdivisions smaller than a State including street address city county precinct zip code and their equivalent geocodes except for the initial three digits of a zip code if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census Internet Protocol number biometric data and any other unique identifying number characteristic or code.

The disease risk logic module further includes a disease identification process . The disease identification process is adapted to identify one or more diseases or conditions of interest for each patient. The disease identification process considers data such as lab orders lab values clinical text and narrative notes and other clinical and historical information to determine the probability that a patient has a particular disease. Additionally during disease identification natural language processing is conducted on unstructured clinical and non clinical data to determine the disease or diseases that the physician believes are prevalent. This process may be performed iteratively over the course of many days to establish a higher confidence in the disease identification as the physician becomes more confident in the diagnosis. New or updated patient data may not support a previously identified disease and the system would automatically remove the patient from that disease list. The natural language processing combines a rule based model and a statistically based learning model.

The disease identification process utilizes a hybrid model of natural language processing which combines a rule based model and a statistically based learning model. During natural language processing raw unstructured data for example physicians notes and reports first go through a process called tokenization. The tokenization process divides the text into basic units of information in the form of single words or short phrases by using defined separators such as punctuation marks spaces or capitalizations. Using the rule based model these basic units of information are identified in a meta data dictionary and assessed according to predefined rules that determine meaning. Using the statistical based learning model the disease identification process quantifies the relationship and frequency of word and phrase patterns and then processes them using statistical algorithms. Using machine learning the statistical based learning model develops inferences based on repeated patterns and relationships. The disease identification process performs a number of complex natural language processing functions including text pre processing lexical analysis syntactic parsing semantic analysis handling multi word expression word sense disambiguation and other functions.

For example if a physician s notes include the following 55 yo m c h o dm cri. now with adib rvr chfexac and rle cellulitis going to 10W tele. The data integration logic is operable to translate these notes as Fifty five year old male with history of diabetes mellitus chronic renal insufficiency now with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response congestive heart failure exacerbation and right lower extremity cellulitis going to 10 West and on continuous cardiac monitoring. 

Continuing with the prior example the disease identification process is adapted to further ascertain the following 1 the patient is being admitted specifically for atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure 2 the atrial fibrillation is severe because rapid ventricular rate is present 3 the cellulitis is on the right lower extremity 4 the patient is on continuous cardiac monitoring or telemetry and 5 the patient appears to have diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency.

The disease risk logic module further comprises a predictive model process that is adapted to predict the risk of particular diseases or condition of interest according to one or more predictive models. For example if the hospital desires to determine the level of risk for future readmission for all patients currently admitted with heart failure the heart failure predictive model may be selected for processing patient data. However if the hospital desires to determine the risk levels for all internal medicine patients for any cause an all cause readmissions predictive model may be used to process the patient data. As another example if the hospital desires to identify those patients at risk for short term and long term diabetic complications the diabetes predictive model may be used to target those patients. Other predictive models may include HIV readmission diabetes identification risk for cardiopulmonary arrest kidney disease progression acute coronary syndrome pneumonia cirrhosis all cause disease independent readmission colon cancer pathway adherence and others.

Continuing to use the prior example the predictive model for congestive heart failure may take into account a set of risk factors or variables including the worst values for laboratory and vital sign variables such as albumin total bilirubin creatine kinase creatinine sodium blood urea nitrogen partial pressure of carbon dioxide white blood cell count troponin I glucose internationalized normalized ratio brain natriuretic peptide pH temperature pulse diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure. Further non clinical factors are also considered for example the number of home address changes in the prior year risky health behaviors e.g. use of illicit drugs or substance number of emergency room visits in the prior year history of depression or anxiety and other factors. The predictive model specifies how to categorize and weight each variable or risk factor and the method of calculating the predicted probably of readmission or risk score. In this manner the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method is able to stratify in real time the risk of each patient that arrives at a hospital or another healthcare facility. Therefore those patients at the highest risks are automatically identified so that targeted intervention and care may be instituted. One output from the disease risk logic module includes the risk scores of all the patients for particular disease or condition. In addition the module may rank the patients according to the risk scores and provide the identities of those patients at the top of the list. For example the hospital may desire to identify the top 20 patients most at risk for congestive heart failure readmission and the top 5 of patients most at risk for cardio pulmonary arrest in the next 24 hours. Other diseases and conditions that may be identified using predictive modeling include for example HIV readmission diabetes identification kidney disease progression colorectal cancer continuum screening meningitis management acid base management anticoagulation management etc.

The disease risk logic module may further include a natural language generation module . The natural language generation module is adapted to receive the output from the predictive model such as the risk score and risk variables for a patient and translate the data to present the evidence that the patient is at high risk for that disease or condition. This module thus provides the intervention coordination team additional information that supports why the patient has been identified as high risk for the particular disease or condition. In this manner the intervention coordination team may better formulate the targeted inpatient and outpatient intervention and treatment plan to address the patient s specific situation.

The disease risk logic module further includes an artificial intelligence AI model tuning process . The artificial intelligence model tuning process utilizes adaptive self learning capabilities using machine learning technologies. The capacity for self reconfiguration enables the system and method to be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to detect and incorporate trends or differences in the underlying patient data or population that may affect the predictive accuracy of a given algorithm. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may periodically retrain a selected predictive model for improved accurate outcome to allow for selection of the most accurate statistical methodology variable count variable selection interaction terms weights and intercept for a local health system or clinic. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may automatically modify or improve a predictive model in three exemplary ways. First it may adjust the predictive weights of clinical and non clinical variables without human supervision. Second it may adjust the threshold values of specific variables without human supervision. Third the artificial intelligence model tuning process may without human supervision evaluate new variables present in the data feed but not used in the predictive model which may result in improved accuracy. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may compare the actual observed outcome of the event to the predicted outcome then separately analyze the variables within the model that contributed to the incorrect outcome. It may then re weigh the variables that contributed to this incorrect outcome so that in the next reiteration those variables are less likely to contribute to a false prediction. In this manner the artificial intelligence model tuning process is adapted to reconfigure or adjust the predictive model based on the specific clinical setting or population in which it is applied. Further no manual reconfiguration or modification of the predictive model is necessary. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may also be useful to scale the predictive model to different health systems populations and geographical areas in a rapid timeframe.

As an example of how the artificial intelligence model tuning process functions the sodium variable coefficients may be periodically reassessed to determine or recognize that the relative weight of an abnormal sodium laboratory result on a new population should be changed from 0.1 to 0.12. Over time the artificial intelligence model tuning process examines whether thresholds for sodium should be updated. It may determine that in order for the threshold level for an abnormal sodium laboratory result to be predictive for readmission it should be changed from for example 140 to 136 mg dL. Finally the artificial intelligence model tuning process is adapted to examine whether the predictor set the list of variables and variable interactions should be updated to reflect a change in patient population and clinical practice. For example the sodium variable may be replaced by the NT por BNP protein variable which was not previously considered by the predictive model.

The results from the disease risk logic module are provided to the hospital personnel such as the intervention coordination team and other caretakers by a data presentation and system configuration logic module . The data presentation logic module includes a dashboard interface that is adapted to provide information on the performance of the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method . A user e.g. hospital personnel administrator and intervention coordination team is able to find specific data they seek through simple and clear visual navigation cues icons windows and devices. The interface may further be responsive to audible commands for example. Because the number of patients a hospital admits each day can be overwhelming a simple graphical interface that maximizes efficiency and reduce user navigation time is desirable. The visual cues are preferably presented in the context of the problem being evaluated e.g. readmissions out of ICU cardiac arrest diabetic complications among others .

The dashboard user interface allows interactive requesting of a variety of views reports and presentations of extracted data and risk score calculations from an operational database within the system. including for example summary views of a list of patient in a specific care location detailed explanation of the components of the various sub scores graphical representations of the data for a patient or population over time comparison of incidence rates of predicted events to the rates of prediction in a specified time frame summary text clippings lab trends and risk scores on a particular patient for assistance in dictation or preparation of history and physical reports daily notes sign off continuity of care notes operative notes discharge summaries continuity of care documents to outpatient medical practitioners order generation to automate the generation of orders authorized by a local care providers healthcare environment and state and national guidelines to be returned to the practitioner s office outside healthcare provider networks or for return to a hospital or practices electronic medical record aggregation of the data into frequently used medical formulas to assist in care provision including but not limited to acid base calculation MELD score Child Pugh Turcot score TIMI risk score CHADS score estimated creatinine clearance Body Surface area Body Mass Index adjuvant neoadjuvant and metastatic cancer survival nomograms MEWS score APACHE score SWIFT score NIH stroke scale PORT score AJCC staging and publishing of elements of the data on scanned or electronic versions of forms to create automated data forms.

The data presentation and system configuration logic module further includes a messaging interface that is adapted to generate output messaging code in forms such as HL7 messaging text messaging e mail messaging multimedia messaging web pages web portals REST XML computer generated speech constructed document forms containing graphical numeric and text summary of the risk assessment reminders and recommended actions. The interventions generated or recommended by the system and method may include risk score report to the primary physician to highlight risk of readmission for their patients score report via new data field input into the EMR for use by population surveillance of entire population in hospital covered entity accountable care population or other level of organization within a healthcare providing network comparison of aggregate risk of readmissions for a single hospital or among hospitals to allow risk standardized comparisons of hospital readmission rates automated incorporation of score into discharge summary template continuity of care document within providers in the inpatient setting or to outside physician consultants and primary care physicians HL7 message to facility communication of readmission risk transition to nonhospital physicians and communicate subcomponents of the aggregate social environmental score clinical score and global risk score. These scores would highlight potential strategies to reduce readmissions including generating optimized medication lists allowing pharmacies to identify those medication on formulary to reduce out of pocket cost and improve outpatient compliance with the pharmacy treatment plan flagging nutritional education needs identifying transportation needs assessing housing instability to identify need for nursing home placement transitional housing Section 8 HHS housing assistance identifying poor self regulatory behavior for additional follow up phone calls identifying poor social network scores leading to recommendation for additional in home RN assessment flagging high substance abuse score for consultation of rehabilitation counselling for patients with substance abuse issues.

This output may be transmitted wirelessly or via LAN WAN the Internet and delivered to healthcare facilities electronic medical record stores user electronic devices e.g. pager text messaging program mobile telephone tablet computer mobile computer laptop computer desktop computer and server health information exchanges and other data stores databases devices and users. The system and method may automatically generate transmit and present information such as high risk patient lists with risk scores natural language generated text reports recommended actions alerts Continuity of Care Documents flags appointment reminders and questionnaires.

The data presentation and system configuration logic module further includes a system configuration interface . Local clinical preferences knowledge and approaches may be directly provided as input to the predictive models through the system configuration interface . This system configuration interface allows the institution or health system to set or reset variable thresholds predictive weights and other parameters in the predictive model directly. The system configuration interface preferably includes a graphical user interface designed to minimize user navigation time.

Not shown explicitly in is the de identification process in which the data become disassociated with the patient s identity to comply with HIPAA regulations. The data can be de coupled with the patient s identity whenever they are transmitted over wired or wireless network links that may be compromised and otherwise required by HIPAA. The method is further adapted to reunite the patient data with the patient s identity.

The user may print transmit and otherwise use the displayed information and generate standard or custom reports. The reports may be primarily textual in nature or include graphical information. For example a graphical report may chart the comparison of expected to observed readmission rates for any disease type condition or category for patients enrolled or not enrolled in an intensive intervention program the readmission rates for enrolled versus dropped patients over a period of time for any disease type condition or category. Patients with greater than 95 for example of probability of having heart failure total versus enrolled over a specified time period and the number of patients not readmitted within 30 day discharge readmission window by number of days from discharge. Additional exemplary standard tracking reports that may further identify all enrolled patients for which post discharge appointments are scheduled post discharge phone consults are scheduled patient has attended follow up appointment patient has received post discharge phone consult patient has received and filled medical prescriptions and patient has received transportation voucher. Further sample reports may include a comparison of expected to observed readmission rates for any disease type event or category for enrolled and not enrolled patients readmission rates for enrolled vs. dropped patients over a period of time for any disease type event or category patients with greater than 95 probability of having heart failure total vs. enrolled over a specific time period and the number of patients not readmitted within 30 day discharge readmission window by number of days from discharge. If the probability threshold is not met in block then the patient s data are re evaluated as new or updated data become available.

Another type of reports available are outcome optimization reports. These are reports designed to help users administrators assess the efficacy of a program establish benchmarks and identify needs for change on a systematic and population levels to improve care outcomes. The report may include data that assist in assessing the effectiveness of the identifying high risk patients. Some of the data may demonstrate effort spent patients enrolled and how often those patents truly are afflicted with the identified diseases. Reports may include data that assist in assessing whether interventions are given to the right patients at the right time etc.

As new updated or additional patient data become available as shown in block the data is evaluated to identify or verify disease condition. The patient may be reclassified if the data now indicate the patient should be classified differently for example. A patient may also be identified as an additional disease and be included in another list. For example in the first 24 hours of admissions the system identifies patient Jane Doe as having CHF. Upon receiving more information such as lab results and new physician notes the system identifies Jane Doe as also having AMI. Jane Doe will then be placed in the AMI list and identified as an AMI patient as soon as the new diagnosis is available. Additionally Jane Doe will remain in the CHF list yet she will be identified as an AMI patient in that list.

If there is no new patient data then there is no change to the patient classification and the display reflects the current state of patient classification as shown in block . Accordingly as real time or near real time patient data become available the patients disease and condition classification is re evaluated and updated as necessary.

Targeted predictive readmission diseases may include congestive heart failure pneumonia acute myocardial infraction diabetes cardiopulmonary arrest and mortality cirrhosis readmission HIV readmission sepsis and all causes. Targeted disease identification may include chronic kidney disease sepsis surveillance chronic kidney disease in outpatient diabetes mellitus in outpatient and sepsis. Targeted conditions due to possible adverse event for surveillance may include sepsis post operative pulmonary embolism PE or deep vein thrombosis DVT post operative sepsis post operative shock unplanned return to surgery respiratory failure hypertension unexpected injury inadequate communication omission or errors in assessment diagnosis or monitoring falls hospital acquired infections medication wrong patient patent identification issues out of ICU cardiopulmonary arrest and mortality chronic kidney disease shock trigger for narcan trigger for narcotic over sedation trigger for hypoglycemia and unexpected death.

The evaluation may include inputting comments about the patient for example. As a part of the evaluation process the user may confirm deny or express uncertainty about a patient s disease or condition identification or intervention program enrollment eligibility. For example the user may review the notes and recommendations associated with a particular patient and confirm the inclusion of that patient in the congestive heart failure list as shown in block . For example the user reviews the clipped clinician s notes that call attention to key words and phrases helping him or her find key information regarding disease identification by the system. Key terms such as shortness of breath BNP was elevated and Lasix help the user validate the disease identification of CHF for that patient. If the patient s classification risk level and eligibility level are confirmed there is no change in the patient s classification and the data that are displayed except to indicate this classification has been confirmed as shown in block . The user may supply comments associated with the confirmation. User comments are stored and can be seen by other users in real time or near real time allowing clear and timely communication between team members. The user may proceed to select a report or a display parameter in block or review and evaluate patients in block .

Alternatively the user may disagree with the inclusion of the patient in the congestive heart failure list or express uncertainty. The user may enter comments explaining his or her assessment of and disagreement with the patient s disease identification. User comments are stored and can be seen by other users in real time or near real time allowing clear and timely communication between team members.

If the user denies the classification then the patient is removed from the active list of the target disease or condition and placed on a drop list as shown in block . In response to the user denying the classification the system may additionally display or flag information about the patient that contributed to the inclusion of the patient on a particular list. For example if the user denies the disease ID that John Smith has heart failure the system may further display a query Mr. Smith likely has CHF due to the following factors elevated BNP shortness of breath admitted for decompensated CHF 6 9. Are you sure you want to remove this patient from the active CHF list The user is required to respond to the query with yes or no. The system may additionally request rationale from the user for wanting to remove the patient from the active list. The rationale supplied by the user may be stored and displayed as reviewer comments. The user may also indicate uncertainty and the patient is removed from the active list and placed on a watch list for further evaluation as shown in block . The user may then review and evaluate additional patients on the same target disease list or review patients included on other disease and condition lists. At any point the user may print transmit and otherwise use in some form the displayed information such as generate standard or custom reports.

As an example a patient Kit Yong Chen was identified as a CHF patient on admission. After receiving more data i.e. new lab results and new physician notes during her hospital stay the system has identified this patient as having AMI.

The clinician notes upon admission states 52 yo female w pmh of CAD also with HTN presents with progressively worsening SOB and edema 1 month. 1. Dyspnea likely CHF with elevated BNP afterload reduction with aCEi and diuresis with Lasix. O2 stats stable 2 elevated troponin EKG with strain pattern follow serial enzymes to ROMI and cards consulted for possible Cath. The clinician notes thereafter states 52 yo female with pmh of CAD also with HTN presents with progressively worsening SOB and edema 1 month c CAD with LHC with stent prox LAD. 1. Elevated troponins NSTEMI despite pt denying CP pt with known hx of CAD mild troponin leak 0.13 0.15 0.09 0.1 on admission pt given 325 Plavix load with 300 mg 1 and heparin gtt Metop increased 50 mg q6 possibly change Coreg at later time LHC today per Cardiology with PCI. also discuss with EP for possible ICD placement 2. Heart failure acute on chronic severe diastolic dysfunction be due HTN off meds CAD proBNP elevated 3183 on admission initially started on lasix 40 tid edema much improved now on lasix 40 po bid TTE completed showing 4 chamber dilatation RVH nml LV thickness severely depressed LVSF LVEF 30 mod MR mild TR AR and PR severe diastolic dysfunction RVSP 52 continue on Lasix Lisinopril Metop discuss AICD evaluation with EP vs initial medical management.

The reviewer may assess the admission notes with the Disease ID of CHF compared with the second notes with PIECES Disease ID of AMI in an effort to validate this new real time disease identification. The admission note indicated CHF as the primary disease. Key highlighted terms indicating CHF to a user include pmh of CAD past medical history of coronary artery disease SOB shortness of breath edema elevated BNP. The second note indicates to a user that while the patient has CHF CAD is the primary cause of the CHF. Key highlighted terms such as elevated troponins and NSTEMI Non ST Segment Myocardial Infarction heart attack give the user a snapshot view of the key terms the system used to identify AMI as the primary disease. These highlighted key terms give the users the tools to validate in real time or near real time the system s change in disease identification. The user then confirms denies or expresses uncertainty with the new disease identification. In this example the reviewer would assess the notes with the highlighted terms and validate the change by accepting the change in disease identification. Because the patient s main pathway of intervention would be for AMI the patient identified disease and risk level would appear in the AMI list.

The dashboard user interface may also indicate a change in the level of risk. For example upon return of lab results slightly elevated creatinine and tox screen positive for cocaine and other social factors that influence risk noncompliance with sodium restriction due to homelessness as well as medical pathway language queues the system may identify this patient as high risk. A user can follow these changes in the real time and to validate the change in risk level.

The user may click on a particular patient displayed in a list and obtain additional detailed information about that patient. For example clipped clinician notes patient s assessment and plan are displayed near the bottom of the screen with key words and phrases highlighted or otherwise emphasized to indicate those text that especially contributed to the inclusion of the patient in the identified target disease list condition risk level and eligibility level. The user may scroll through all the clipped clinician notes associated with the patient which are organized chronologically so that the user may review the progression of the disease diagnosis assessments and pathways. Because the user can view the notes in real time or near real time he or she is able to clinically validate the system s assessment of the unstructured text. The display further provide the reviewer s comments that are associated with the confirmation or denial of the disease or condition identification.

Not explicitly shown in are additional features such as a search bar to enable the user to enter one or more search criteria to locate one or more particular patients. For example the user may input a medical record number name admission date disease type risk level event enrolled program etc. to identify a set of patients that satisfy the search criteria. The search criteria may be based on other types of criteria such as those patients that have missed their post discharge appointments.

The display may optionally further include recommendations and reminders generated by the system. These recommendations and reminders may suggest evidence based intervention options that would provide the greatest health benefit to the patient. The proposed intervention may consider clinical and nonclinical patient variables. In addition previous patient enrollment results are factored into the recommended intervention. The orders for post discharge care e.g. nutrition pharmacy etc. may be automatically placed when a patient is enrolled in the program.

The system as described herein is operable to harness simplify sort and present patient information in real time or near real time predict and identify highest risk patients identify adverse events coordinate and alert practitioners and monitor patient outcomes across time and space. The present system improves healthcare efficiency assists with resource allocation and presents the crucial information that lead to better patient outcomes.
