Aspects of the example implementations relate to providing controls for managing geographical storage location of user associated data or content and more specifically use of user specifications to determine a geographical storage location of data associated with the user.

Cloud computing offers a number of potential benefits by allowing data and content to be copied transferred stored and accessed from almost any location in the world. However some countries governments or corporations might have laws rules or policies granting jurisdiction over data or content stored in data centers within their borders. For example a country may access data stored within its borders and permit the prosecution of a user based on the content or data. Thus a user may be subjected to risk because their data or content is stored in a data center in that foreign country.

The subject matter discussed herein relates generally to online services and more particularly to managing storage locations of user associated content or data.

According to an aspect a computer implemented method for determining a geographic location to store user content is provided including determining a content type of user content received from a user via one or more computing devices storing the user content to a first geographic storage location based on a first target geographic specification provided by the user based on the determined content type matching a first content type associated with the first target geographic specification and storing the user content to a second geographic storage location based on a second target geographic specification provided by the user based on the determined content type matching a second content type associated with the second target geographic specification.

According to another aspect a computer implemented method for determining a geographic storage location to store previously stored user content is provided including determining a content type and a current storage location of user content previously stored via one or more computing devices storing the user content to a first geographic storage location based on a first target geographic specification provided by the user based on the determined content type matching a first content type associated with the first target geographic specification and storing the user content to a second geographic storage location based on a second target geographic specification provided by the user based on the determined content type matching a second content type associated with the second target geographic specification.

According to yet another aspect a non transitory computer readable medium having stored therein computer executable instructions for determining a content type of user content received from a user via one or more computing devices storing the user content to a first geographic storage location based on a first target geographic specification provided by the user if the determined content type matches a first content type associated with the first target geographic specification and storing the user content to a second geographic storage location based on a second target geographic specification provided by the user based on the determined content type matching a second content type associated with the second target geographic specification is provided.

According to yet another aspect a non transitory computer readable medium having stored therein computer executable instructions for determining a content type and a current storage location of user content previously stored via one or more computing devices storing the user content to a first geographic storage location based on a first target geographic specification provided by the user based on the determined content type matching a first content type associated with the first target geographic specification and storing the user content to a second geographic storage location based on a second target geographic specification provided by the user based on the determined content type matching a second content type associated with the second target geographic specification is provided.

In addition to a method as described above the implementations may include a device a system and or a computer readable medium but are not limited thereto.

The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example implementations. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. The examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing managing data location.

Service providers may store a user s data or content to a variety of geographic locations. However a user may have preferences as to where his or her content may be stored and where his or her content may not be stored. In some example implementations service providers may provide mechanisms to allow a user to specify areas regions or locations where the user s content or data can or cannot be stored. For example a mechanism may be implemented to allow User A to specify that User A s content can only be stored in data centers located within country X i.e. User A may create whitelist allowing storage of content within Country X . In some example implementations User A may alternatively or additionally specify that User A s content cannot be stored in data centers located within Country Y i.e. User A may create a blacklist preventing storage of content within Country Y .

In some example implementations a user may be given the ability to specify different storage locations where data or content may be stored based on the type of content to be stored. For example a User A may specify that the blog posts cannot be stored in data centers located within Country X and further specify that emails can be stored in data centers located within Country X. Additionally in some example implementations a user may also specify a duration of time for storage location specifications are to be applied or to specify a specific date or time when the storage location specifications should expire. For example User A may specify that User A s content cannot be stored in Country X for 90 days or until after 9 30 on Nov. 1 2013.

As used herein a service provider may be any entity that stores user accounts and or data or is likely implementing similar services. For example cloud based service providers e.g. providing computing and or storage or service may implement at least some of the example implementations described herein to allow users to control storage location of data associated with their accounts and content.

As used herein the terms account data associated with an account or content associated with an account refer to information and data of or about the user related to or associated with the user generated by or for the user and or for communicating with or providing service to the user. An account and or data or content associated with the account may be associated with a website product service online service or application. The term application includes but is not limited to software e.g. a non transitory computer readable medium having instructions executable by a processor which is online e.g. accessible by communication protocol and structure such as the Internet or other communication network . The application may be embodied in the structure described below with respect to below.

As used herein the term website or web site or site refers to a set of web pages for providing or supporting related services. A website can be hosted on at least one computing device e.g. a system server web server application server client or any label accessible via a network or connection wired and or wireless . A website can be accessed and or supported using at least one top level Uniform Resource Locator URL e.g. abc.gov 123.org zxc.com bestads.com virtualbank.com and the like . A website can be operated and or supported by one or more business entities. For example ZXC Corporation may operate the website zxc.com that includes web pages content and or services from zxc.bestads.com e.g. advertisement services provided by another firm and virtualbank.com zxc payment services e.g. financial services provided by a financial institution .

As used herein the terms product service online service or application refer to any information communication infrastructure organization or the like provided by one or more providers to at least one user. Examples of products services or applications may include but are not limited to forums online platforms bulletin boards social networks websites sites chat rooms email communication image sharing sites data sharing platforms video sharing sites online searching data storage cloud storage software tax preparation and filing online banking online investment management and the like. Products services or applications may be provided on any device ranging from a mobile device e.g. smartphone application or apps to a semi mobile device e.g. a laptop and to a non mobile device e.g. a kiosk . A product service or application may communicate to a provider or another product service or application using a wired or wireless connection.

Additionally in some implementations the UI may also provide user interface objects such as links to add additional options to the UI or remove the controls so that a user may specify additional countries or remove previously specified countries. For example but not by way of limitation a user may specify an additional country or countries via object . Previously selected countries may be removed by the user via objects .

Additionally in some example implementations the UI may also provide a button to allow a user to download all data and content associated with an account. The data or content to be downloaded may include but is not limited to photos and photo albums profile data contacts public or private social groups and stream posts.

In this implementation the user may specify countries where data or content cannot be stored. However other implementations may allow the user to specify only countries where data or content may be stored. Further in addition to country specifications other implementations may allow the user to specify postal codes cities states provinces regions or any other geographical unit that may be apparent to person of ordinary skill in the art.

Service providers may also comply with restrictions or limitations on storage locations imposed by laws rules or policies that may apply to data or content generated by users located within a particular jurisdiction. For example if the laws of Country X prohibit data or content generated by the residents of Country X from being stored in data centers located within Country Y a service provider may comply with the law and block storage in Country Y of data or content generated by all users who are reside in Country X even if some users have specified that their data or content should only be stored in Country Y. In other words the service provider can comply with the laws of Country X. In such a situation the service provider may send users a warning message when their specified storage location that appears to conflict with a law of Country X so as to protect the user from inadvertently storing data in a manner that is inconsistent with the law of Country X.

Similarly in operation the service provider receives the second target geographic specification which includes the second target geographic location information and a second content type associated with the second target geographic specification from a user. Again the user may for example use a UI such as UI to provide the second specification to the user. Further the second specification may also contain additional information or data such as a duration of time for the second specified geographic location to be used or a specified time for the second geographic location to expire. It should be noted that the user may optionally decide to provide a second specification at operation or not provide a second specification at operation .

In operation the service provider receives content from a user. The content received from the user can include text data image data video data or any other data that they would like to publish or distribute to other users or date the user would like to save for later use. The content may be an email website post social media post blog entry picture video document or any other form of content as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The content may be received by email FTP transfer website upload or by any other form of data transfer as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

In operation the content type of the received content is determined. The content type may be determined by analyzing metadata or embedded data associated with the content. The content type may also be determined by analyzing the file type or file extension associated with the file name. The content type may also be determined by any other method as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

In operation a geographic storage location for the user content is determined based on the content type of the user content and the first and second target geographic specifications received from the user. Example implementations of a determination of a geographic storage location in operation are discussed in greater detail below with respect to . Further once a geographic storage location is determined in operation the user content is stored to the determined geographic location in operation and the process terminates.

In some example embodiments user content may be stored to a geographic location matching the first target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the first content type associated with the first target geographic specification e.g. a whitelist embodiment . Further user content may be stored to a geographic location matching the second target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the second content type associated with the second target geographic specification i.e. a whitelist embodiment .

For example if User A provides a specification containing the first geographic location Country X for emails first associated content type and the second geographic location Country Y for videos second associated content type received user content that is an email is stored in Country X and received user content that is a video is stored in Country Y .

However in some example embodiments user content may be stored to a geographic location different from the first target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the first content type associated with the first target geographic specification i.e. a blacklist embodiment . Further user content may be stored to a geographic location different from the second target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the second content type associated with the second target geographic specification i.e. a blacklist embodiment .

For example if User A provides a specification containing the first geographic location Country X for emails first associated content type and the second geographic location Country Y for videos second associated content type received user content that is an email is stored in geographic locations other than Country X and received user content that is a video is stored in geographic locations other than Country Y .

Similarly in operation the service provider receives the second target geographic specification which includes the second target geographic location information and a second content type associated with the second target geographic specification from a user. Again the user may for example use a UI such as UI to provide the second specification to the user. Further the second specification may also contain additional information or data such as a duration of time for the second specified geographic location to be used or a specified time for the second geographic location to expire. It should be noted that the user may optionally decide to provide a second specification at operation or not provide a second specification at operation .

In operation the service provided determines a current storage location of previously stored user content. The previously stored user content may have been stored in a location based on previous specifications received by the user or may have been stored based on direct instructions from the user or some other entity. The current storage location may be determined based on the metadata associated with the user content or by any other method as may be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

In operation the content type of the received content is determined. The content type may be determined by analyzing metadata or embedded data associated with the content. The content type may also be determined by analyzing the file type or file extension associated with the file name. The content type may also be determined by any other method as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

In operation a new geographic storage location for the user content is determined based on the content type of the user content the current storage location of the user content and the first and second target geographic specifications received from the user. Example implementations of a determination of a geographic storage location in operation are discussed in greater detail below with respect to . Further once a geographic storage location is determined in operation the user content is stored to the determined geographic location in operation and the process terminates.

In some example embodiments user content may be stored to a new geographic location matching the first target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the first content type associated with the first target geographic specification i.e. a whitelist embodiment and the current storage location does not match the first target specification. Further user content may be stored to a new geographic location matching the second target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the second content type associated with the second target geographic specification e.g. a whitelist embodiment and the current storage location does not match the second target specification.

For example if User A provides a specification containing the first geographic location Country X for emails first associated content type and the second geographic location Country Y for videos second associated content type received user content that is an email is stored in Country X and received user content that is a video is stored in Country Y .

However in some example embodiments user content may be stored to a new geographic location different from the first target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the first content type associated with the first target geographic specification i.e. a blacklist embodiment and the current storage location matches the first target specification. Further user content may be stored to a geographic location different from the second target geographic specification if the content type of the user content matches the second content type associated with the second target geographic specification i.e. a blacklist embodiment and the current storage location matches the second target specification.

For example if User A provides a specification containing the first geographic location Country X for emails first associated content type and the second geographic location Country Y for videos second associated content type received user content that is an email is stored in geographic locations other than Country X and received user content that is a video is stored in geographic locations other than Country Y .

If the target specifications are determined to have been received in YES the process proceeds to . In a determination is made whether the content type of the content or data received from the user in operation as been determined. If it is determined in that the content type of the received user content or data has not or cannot be determined NO the process flow is terminated. In some example implementations the work flow may then be returned to the process of to await determination of the content type of the user content. In some example implementations a user may be requested to identify the content type to allow user target specifications to be applied to the content. In other example implementations the user content may be stored to a default storage location specified by the user.

If it is determined in operation that the content type of the user content has been confirmed i.e. determined YES the process proceeds to operation . In operation the content type of received user content is compared to the content type associated with the first target geographic storage location received from the user to determine if the content types match.

In example process if the content type of the received user content is determined to match the content type associated with the first target geographic storage location YES in the content received from the user is stored to a geographic storage location matching the first target geographic storage location in operation and process is terminated. In some example implementations a record may also be created of where the data or content has been stored in operation to allow a user to later request a list or report of all geographic locations where their data or content has been stored. If such request is received all records of geographic locations where the user s data or content has been stored may be provided to the user.

If the content type of the received user content is determined to not match the content type associated with the first target geographic storage location NO in process continues to operation . In operation the content type of received user content is compared to the content type associated with the second target geographic storage location received from the user to determine if the content types match.

In example process if the content type of the received user content is determined to match the content type associated with the second target geographic storage location YES in the content received from the user is stored to a geographic storage location matching the second target geographic storage location in operation and process is terminated.

If such request is received all records of geographic locations where the user s data or content has been stored may be provided to the user.

If the content type of the received user content is determined to not match the content type associated with the second target geographic storage location NO in process continues to operation . In operation the content or data received from the user is stored to any available storage location because the system has determined that no target geographic specification has been provided by the user for content have a content type matching the content type of the content or data received from the user. In some implementations the received content may be stored to a default storage location specified by the user or may be stored to a default storage location selected by the service provider. Once the user content or data is stored to a storage location in operation process is terminated. Again in some example implementations a record may also be created of where the data or content has been stored in operation to allow a user to later request a list or report of all geographic locations where their data or content has been stored. If such request is received all records of geographic locations where the user s data or content has been stored may be provided to the user.

If the target specifications are determined to have been received in YES the process proceeds to . In a determination is made whether the content type of the content or data received from the user in operation as been determined.

If it is determined in operation that the content type of the user content has been confirmed i.e. determined YES the process proceeds to operation . In operation the content type of received user content is compared to the content type associated with the first target geographic storage location received from the user to determine if the content types match.

In example process if the content type of the received user content is determined to match the content type associated with the first target geographic storage location YES in the content received from the user is stored to any geographic storage location that does not match or is different from the first target geographic storage location in operation and process is terminated. For example the user content may be stored to a default geographic location specified by the user or by the service provider or to a randomly selected geographic storage location that does not match the first target geographic location. In some example implementations a record may also be created of where the data or content has been stored in operation to allow a user to later request a list or report of all geographic locations where their data or content has been stored. If such request is received all records of geographic locations where the user s data or content has been stored may be provided to the user.

If the content type of the received user content is determined to not match the content type associated with the first target geographic storage location NO in process continues to operation . In operation the content type of received user content is compared to the content type associated with the second target geographic storage location received from the user to determine if the content types match.

In example process if the content type of the received user content is determined to match the content type associated with the second target geographic storage location YES in the content received from the user is stored to any geographic storage location that does not match or is different from the second target geographic storage location in operation and process is terminated. For example the user content may be stored to a default geographic location specified by the user or by the service provider or to a randomly selected geographic storage location that does not match the second target geographic location. In some example implementations a record may also be created of where the data or content has been stored in operation to allow a user to later request a list or report of all geographic locations where their data or content has been stored.

If the target specifications are determined to have been received in YES the process proceeds to . In a determination is made whether the content type of the content or data previously stored as been determined. If it is determined in that the content type of the previously stored user content or data has not or cannot be determined NO the process flow is terminated.

In example process if the content type of the previously stored user content is determined to match the content type associated with the first target geographic storage location YES in the current storage location of the previously stored user content or data determined in operation of process is compared to the first target geographic storage location specification in operation to determine if the current storage location matches the first target geographic storage location specification. If it is determined in that the current storage location matches the first target geographic storage location specification YES the current storage location is maintained i.e. the previously stored user content or data continues to be stored at the current storage location in operation and process is terminated.

In some example implementations a record may also be created of where the data or content has been stored in operation to allow a user to later request a list or report of all geographic locations where their data or content has been stored. If such request is received all records of geographic locations where the user s data or content has been stored may be provided to the user.

If it is determined in that the current storage location does not match the first target geographic storage location specification NO the previously stored user content is moved and stored to a new geographic storage location that matches the first target geographic storage location in operation and process is terminated.

In some implementations devices may be considered user devices e.g. devices used by users to access services and or issue requests such as on a social network . Devices may be devices associated with service providers e.g. used by service providers to provide services and or store data such as webpages text text portions images image portions audios audio segments videos video segments and or information thereabout .

For example a user e.g. Alice may access view generate and or share content to be stored by the service provide using user device or on a social network supported by one or more devices . Alice may also may access and or view her stored content or data using device or .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled to input user interface and output device interface . Either one or both of input user interface and output device interface can be a wired or wireless interface and can be detachable. Input user interface may include any device component sensor or interface physical or virtual that can be used to provide input e.g. buttons touch screen interface keyboard a pointing cursor control microphone camera braille motion sensor optical reader and or the like . Output device interface may include a display television monitor printer speaker braille or the like. In some example implementations input user interface and output device interface can be embedded with or physically coupled to the computing device . In other example implementations other computing devices may function as or provide the functions of input user interface and output device interface for a computing device .

Examples of computing device may include but are not limited to highly mobile devices e.g. smartphones devices in vehicles and other machines devices carried by humans and animals and the like mobile devices e.g. tablets notebooks laptops personal computers portable televisions radios and the like and devices not designed for mobility e.g. desktop computers other computers information kiosks televisions with one or more processors embedded therein and or coupled thereto radios and the like .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled e.g. via I O interface to external storage and network for communicating with any number of networked components devices and systems including one or more computing devices of the same or different configuration. Computing device or any connected computing device can be functioning as providing services of or referred to as a server client thin server general machine special purpose machine or another label.

I O interface can include but is not limited to wired and or wireless interfaces using any communication or I O protocols or standards e.g. Ethernet 802.11x Universal System Bus WiMax modem a cellular network protocol and the like for communicating information to and or from at least all the connected components devices and network in computing environment . Network can be any network or combination of networks e.g. the Internet local area network wide area network a telephonic network a cellular network satellite network and the like .

Computing device can use and or communicate using computer usable or computer readable media including transitory media and non transitory media. Transitory media include transmission media e.g. metal cables fiber optics signals carrier waves and the like. Non transitory media include magnetic media e.g. disks and tapes optical media e.g. CD ROM digital video disks Blu ray disks solid state media e.g. RAM ROM flash memory solid state storage and other non volatile storage or memory.

Computing device can be used to implement techniques methods applications processes or computer executable instructions in some example computing environments. Computer executable instructions can be retrieved from transitory media and stored on and retrieved from non transitory media. The executable instructions can originate from one or more of any programming scripting and machine languages e.g. C C C Java Visual Basic Python Perl JavaScript and others .

Processor s can execute under any operating system OS not shown in a native or virtual environment. One or more applications can be deployed that include logic unit application programming interface API unit input unit output unit specification receiving unit storage determination unit content type determination unit and inter unit communication mechanism for the different units to communicate with each other with the OS and with other applications not shown . For example specification receiving unit storage determination unit and content type determination unit may implement one or more processes shown in . The described units and elements can be varied in design function configuration or implementation and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

In some example implementations when information or an execution instruction is received by API unit it may be communicated to one or more other units e.g. logic unit input unit output unit specification receiving unit storage determination unit and content type determination unit . For example the specification receiving unit may receive first and second target geographic specifications each associated with a first content type and a second content type respectively from a user input with the input unit using the API unit . Additionally after the input unit has detected user content has been received the input unit may use API unit to communicate the user content to the content type determining unit so that the content type may be determined. Further the received first and second target geographic specifications received by the specification receiving unit and the content type determined by the content type determination unity may be communicated to the storage determination unity using the API unit . Once the storage determination unit makes a geographic storage location the storage determination unit may instruct that the user content be stored to external storage located in the determined geographic storage location using the API unit .

In some instances logic unit may be configured to control the information flow among the units and direct the services provided by API unit input unit output unit specification receiving unit storage determination unit and content type determination unit in some example implementations described above. For example the flow of one or more processes or implementations may be controlled by logic unit alone or in conjunction with API unit .

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
