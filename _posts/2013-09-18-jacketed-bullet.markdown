title: Jacketed bullet
abstract: A jacketed bullet having a penetrator constructed of a hard material in line with a slug having a lower modulus. At least a portion of both the slug and the penetrator are then encased by a metal jacket. A plurality of circumferentially spaced and axially extending flutes are formed along the slug and possibly the penetrator. These flutes receive deformation of the jacket upon firing of the bullet into a rifled gun bore to thereby reduce friction between the bullet and the gun bore during operation.

Jacketed bullets are used in a wide range of firearms in both military and nonmilitary applications. In a jacketed bullet a penetrator constructed of a had material forms the tip of the bullet. A slug constructed of a material having a lower modulus is then positioned behind the penetrator and at least a portion of both the slug and the penetrator are encased in a metal jacket. The jacketed bullet is then assembled into a cartridge with a propelling charge and primer.

In order to improve the stability and accuracy of the bullet most firearms today include a rifled bore. A rifled bore extends in a helical fashion along at least a portion of the barrel. During launch of the bullet the rifling in the barrel imparts spin to the bullet which increases the accuracy of the firearm.

In order to ensure proper operation of the rifling and to minimize leakage of the gasses from the firing of the bullet the outside diameter of the jacket is slightly greater than the inside diameter of the rifling. Consequently when the bullet is loaded into the chamber the barrel rifling engages the outer surface of the jacket and radially inwardly compresses or engraves the jacket. Such engraving creates a slight elongation of the slug and effectively requires energy to plastically deform the bullet. This deformation energy and related frictional losses reduces the overall muzzle velocity of the firearm.

Historically lead has been used as the material for the slug because it has a low modulus of elasticity with respect to almost every other metal and is easily deformed. Consequently the energy stored in the bullet by engraving is very low and only minimally affects the muzzle velocity of lead core bullets.

The use of lead as the material for the slug however creates other problems. For example in shooting ranges the lead content in the ground around the range may result in an unacceptable lead toxicity.

Consequently other materials have recently been used for the slug. These other materials include for example copper brass bronze zinc steel and other materials. All of these other materials however have an elastic modulus greater than the modulus of lead.

Thus when using a jacketed bullet with a nonlead slug the bullet exhibits a greater resistance to deformation during engraving as the bullet is fired. This in turn increases the overall work required to engrave the bullet when fired compared to a jacketed bullet with a lead slug which requires less deformation work to engrave the bullet during firing. This reduction of energy during firing results in a reduced bullet velocity upon exit from the gun barrel assuming of course all other factors are equal.

The present invention provides a jacketed bullet which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known jacketed bullets.

In brief the jacketed bullet of the present invention comprises a penetrator constructed of a hard material. A slug is axially aligned with the penetrator and this slug is constructed of a nonlead material such as copper bronze zinc steel iron tin and or alloys thereof. At least a portion of both the penetrator as well as the slug are encased with a metal jacket thus forming the bullet. Unlike the previously known jacketed bullets however in the present invention at least one and preferably a plurality of longitudinally extending flutes are formed along the outer surface of the slug. Flutes may be oriented with the axis of the bore or be swept helically in such a fashion as to match the rifling of the barrel or be progressive to begin straight and eventually match the rifling of the barrel. These flutes thus present a relief volume within the interior of the bullet into which the metal jacket can deform when the metal jacket is engraved upon firing the bullet.

By allowing the jacket to deform into the flutes during engraving the elongation of the bullet which would otherwise be caused by engraving is minimized or altogether eliminated. This in turn effectively reduces the energy stored in the bullet caused by engraving and reduces the contact force and friction between the bullet and the rifle bore during launch. Such reduced friction increases the muzzle velocity of the bullet to the same levels as metal jacket bullets with lead slugs assuming all else remains the same.

With reference first to a longitudinal partial sectional view of a bullet according to the present invention is shown. The bullet includes a penetrator which narrows to a point at the front of the bullet . A base of the penetrator is generally cylindrical in shape. Portions of the penetrator may or may not be exposed from the jacket at the tip.

The penetrator may be made of any hard material such as tungsten carbide steel steel depleted uranium and the like. Furthermore the penetrator is of standard construction for jacketed bullets.

A slug is generally cylindrical in shape and is axially aligned with the base of the penetrator . The slug may be constructed of any conventional material including those materials with an elastic modulus higher than lead. Consequently bronze brass copper zinc steel iron tin bismuth as well as alloys thereof may be used as the material for the slug . Still referring to at least a portion of the slug and penetrator are encased in a metal jacket . The metal jacket illustrated in is a full metal jacket and is secured to the slug and penetrator by a crimp at a rear end of the slug . Or the metal jacket could be a reverse crimp jacket leaving the tip part of the penetrator exposed.

With reference now to unlike the previously known slugs the slug according to the present invention has at least one flute and preferably several circumferentially equidistantly spaced flutes which extend longitudinally from a front end of the slug and to its rear end . The flutes may extend along the entire length of the slug or as shown in along only a portion of the axial length of the slug . The cross sectional shape of the flutes furthermore may have a flat bottom as shown in or other shapes.

With reference now to a gun barrel includes rifling along at least a portion of the gun bore . The depth of the flutes in the slug is substantially the same as the radial length of the rifling . Consequently when the bullet is fired in the gun barrel so that the rifling engraves the outer surface of the jacket the jacket deforms into the flutes and minimizes elongation and other strain energy imparted to the slug and bullet . Since the flutes provide a volume for the radial inward deformation of the metal jacket during engraving the overall energy stored in the bullet caused by engraving as well as the friction between the bullet and the rifle bore is substantially reduced.

With reference now to although the flutes may run axially along the outer surface of the slug alternatively the flutes may have a helical angle as shown in to match the helical angle of the barrel rifling . The flutes may also extend partially along the rear portion of the penetrator as shown in .

The reduction in the friction between the bullet and the rifle bore upon firing results in a higher exit velocity of the bullet from the barrel than an identical bullet without flutes in the slug . This in turn increases the range and accuracy of the firearm.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a novel jacketed bullet design. Having described my invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.

The present invention can be described in a series of steps. The following series of steps describe the invention. First forming a bullet from a slug having an outer surface. After which a penetrator also having an outer surface said penetrator being axially aligned to said slug and a metal jacket disposed around the majority of said outer surface of said slug and said penetrator. Then disposing a plurality of helical flutes placed in an equidistant pattern longitudinally extending upon said outer surface of said slug and said penetrator. After which rifling the inside surface of a gun barrel to have an identical helical flute pattern of that of said slug and said penetrator so as to match that of said slug and said penetrator and said gun barrel being formed to a depth so as to engage the flutes of said slug and said penetrator through deformation of the metal jacket as caused by the gun barrel rifling. Then firing said bullet from said gun barrel whereby said metal jacket is deformed and pressed into the flutes of said slug and said penetrator in order to reduce the friction between said bullet and said gun barrel while said bullet traverses said gun barrel. It is also important to note that the penetrator is formed from a material denser than that of the slug.
