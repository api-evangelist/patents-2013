title: Systems and methods for associating virtual content relative to real-world locales
abstract: Aspects of the invention provide techniques and systems for delivering geographically-relevant content to a mobile device. Geolocation and orientation data is taken from the mobile device, including directional orientation and a vertical angle of the mobile device as it is being pointed at a physical locale. Based on the geolocation and orientation data, an angular field of view is identified relative to a real-world coordinate system. Geospatial data describing the field of view is transmitted to a central server, which, based on geospatial coordinates of pre-defined virtual locales identifies the spatially corresponding virtual locale(s) and sends spatial definitions and structurally-organized content related to the virtual locale(s) back to the device. Users provide input signals to the mobile device to indicate navigational commands related to the content, and the display of the content on the device is iteratively updated based on the input signals and detected changes in the geolocation and orientation data of the device.

This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 61 665 596 and 61 781 212 filed on Jun. 28 2012 and Mar. 14 2013 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The invention relates generally to the association of World Wide Web content with a physical locale and more specifically to the use of a wireless mobile device to evaluate real world locations through interaction with co located three dimensional virtual locales triggering the display of web based content associated with that physical locale.

Mobile wireless communication devices have become ubiquitous in the everyday life of consumer and workers. While initially designed to replace the standard telephone devices now have similar if not more functionality than desktop computers. For example in addition to telephone service and email today s devices allow users to capture images and video use complex applications play games and purchase goods and services.

These mobile devices and communications networks that support them have long been used to deliver information relating to businesses to end users. Such information includes among other things directory information and information relating to products and services such as for example advertisements of various types. Many mobile communications networks are additionally aware of end users geospatial location in real time as well as users demographic information and online activities and can use this information to target advertisements to a consumer.

However most purchases and activities are driven first by a consumer either as part of a deliberate action looking for a particular item at a particular store or on impulse a consumer walks by a store or item and decides to buy it . Moreover conventional mobile based advertising is static in that an advertisement or other content is delivered to the user but the user has no ability to manipulate navigate or otherwise interact with the content. What is needed therefore are techniques that allow consumers to impulsively initiate actions and purchases using their mobile devices based on their immediate physical surroundings and do so in an interactive manner.

Embodiments of the invention provide methods and supporting systems for facilitating the delivery of context relevant content to a user of a mobile device. In addition to determining the content to be delivered based on the users physical location using for example GPS for outdoor positioning or IPS for indoor positioning the orientation direction and movement of the device may also be used. The directional and orientation data may be used to explore a portion of the physical locale through interaction with a spatially co located virtual locale defined as two dimensional planes or three dimensional volumes using a combination of real world geospatial coordinates directionality and distance values relative to the surrounding physical world. As a result two individuals standing in the same place but pointing their device in different directions or at a different angle may receive different content. Further the content may include a collection of content structured in a manner that facilitates navigation of the content as the user manipulates his device. As such users can interact with the content e.g. scroll through drill down etc. using haptic interactions with the device fixed on a specific virtual locale or as it is repositioned reoriented or moved such that it is directed at a different virtual locale.

As such one aspect of the invention provides a method for delivering geographically relevant content to a mobile device that includes receiving geolocation and orientation data from the mobile device wherein the orientation device includes directional orientation and a vertical angle of the mobile device as it is being pointed at a physical locale. Based on the geolocation and orientation data an angular field of view is identified relative to a real world coordinate system. Geospatial data describing the field of view is transmitted to a central server which based on geospatial coordinates of pre defined virtual locales identifies the spatially corresponding virtual locale s and sends both spatial definitions in the form of two dimensional planes or three dimensional volumes expressed in relation to the physical world and structurally organized content related to the virtual locale s back to the device. Users provide input signals in the form of haptic interactions with the mobile device to indicate navigational commands related to the content and the display of the content on the device is iteratively updated based on the input signals and detected changes in the geolocation and orientation data of the device where user interface elements are displayed triggered by the detected intersection of the device field of view and any virtual locale spatial volume.

In some embodiments the virtual locale may be a two dimensional plane corresponding to a sign a billboard or a storefront. In other instances the virtual locale may be a three dimensional volume corresponding to a building a landmark or a naturally occurring element of the landscape and in other embodiments the virtual locale may not be related to the physical environment but only defined in relation to the physical environment. The corresponding virtual locales are spatially related to the corresponding physical locales but are not bound to the physical shape.

In certain cases the virtual locale may include multiple sub locales such as in relation to a building with multiple businesses located in the building. In such cases the structurally organized content may include information related to each of the sub locales such that the haptic interactions direct navigation of the content on the mobile device among information related to each of the sub locales. For example the structurally organized content may be organized hierarchically such that parent nodes at a first level in the hierarchy include top level content for each of the sub locales and child nodes at levels subordinate to the first level include subcontent associated with the each of the sub locales. The structurally organized content may include a traversable menu of content such that the haptic interactions cause content elements to be selected from the menu. The content displayed on the device at any one time may be a subset of the total content received at the device from the server.

The haptic interactions may include for example sliding a finger vertically along a face of the mobile device sliding a finger horizontally along the face of the mobile device touching moving the device reorienting the device assessing the frequency speed and combination of touches and after a specified time duration removing a finger from the face of the mobile device or maintaining contact between a finger and the face of a mobile device for a period of time greater than the specified time duration.

In another aspect a system for delivering geographically relevant content to a mobile device includes a processor for executing computer executable instructions and a memory for storing the instructions. Upon execution of the instructions by the processor a content delivery application is instantiated that identifies virtual locales and displays structured content associated with the corresponding physical locale. The application receives geolocation and orientation data from the mobile device the orientation data including a directional orientation and a vertical angle of the mobile device. Based on the geolocation data and the orientation data an angular field of view relative to a real world coordinate system is determined as the mobile device is pointed at a physical locale and the geospatial data describing the field of view is sent to a central server. In response the application receives the corresponding virtual locale data such two dimensional plane or three dimensional volume definitions and structurally organized content associated with the physical locale filtered based on a maximum distance criteria calculation between the geospatial data describing the field of view and geospatial coordinates of the virtual locale. In certain cases additional filters may be used especially in areas of high locale density such as a radius of interest user specific metadata time of day etc. and or a weighting priority factor. The application further receives input signals representing haptic interactions with the mobile device and iteratively updates content displayed on the device based on the haptic interactions and detected changes in the geolocation and orientation data.

In some embodiments the virtual locale may be a two dimensional plane such as in relation to a sign a billboard or a storefront. In other instances the virtual local may be a three dimensional volume such as in relation to a building a landmark or a naturally occurring element of the landscape.

In certain cases the virtual locale may include multiple sub locales such as a building with multiple businesses located in the building. In such cases the structurally organized content may include information related to each of the sub locales such that the haptic interactions direct navigation of the content on the mobile device among information related to each of the sub locales. For example the structurally organized content may be organized hierarchically such that parent nodes at a first level in the hierarchy include top level content for each of the sub locales and child nodes at levels subordinate to the first level include subcontent associated with the each of the sub locales. The structurally organized content may include a traversable menu of content such that the haptic interactions cause content elements to be selected from the menu. The content displayed on the device at any one time may be a subset of the total content received at the device from the server.

The haptic interactions may include for example sliding a finger vertically along a face of the mobile device sliding a finger horizontally along the face of the mobile device touching and after a specified time duration removing a finger from the face of the mobile device or maintaining contact between a finger and the face of a mobile device for a period of time greater than the specified time duration.

The methods and systems described as various embodiments of this invention allow any mobile device to trigger initiation of executable commands within an application when a directional vector aligned with the orientation of the device and calculated in three dimensional world coordinates in relation to the surrounding physical world intersects pre defined planes that have also been defined in three dimensional world coordinates in relation to the surrounding physical world.

As the directional vector crosses into a pre defined two dimensional plane or three dimensional volume the executable command associated with this plane is transferred to the mobile device. The process may be initiated when the user of the mobile device initiates a native application on the device by depressing the associated user interface icon. Continuing to depress the smart display while changing the orientation of the smart device causes the directional vector dynamically aligned to the device to dynamically change its value with relation to the three dimensional world coordinate system in which it is defined. Each time this directional vector spatially intersects with one of the pre defined two dimensional planes or three dimensional volumes descriptive information associated with this two dimensional plane or three dimensional volume is transferred back to the smart device from a remote database either dedicated to supporting the system or cloud based . If the user stops depressing the smart display while the directional vector lies within a pre defined two dimensional plane or three dimensional volume then an executable command associated with this plane is transferred to the smart device from the remote database and is executed on the smart device. If the user stops depressing the smart display while the directional vector lies outside all pre defined two dimensional planes or three dimensional volumes then the list describing all previously intersected planes or volumes remains on the display for possible interaction by the user.

As one general example and as described in greater detail below a billboard along a busy street may be identified as a pre defined plane based on its GPS coordinates and direction of placement. The billboard is uniquely identified in a central database in which many planes are defined and stored. In addition information associated with the billboard is stored in the database. Examples of such information include the company or brand advertising on the billboard information about the product venue or event being advertised on the billboard venues near the billboard etc. As a user approaches the billboard the device captures the real world coordinates and directional information and transmits the information to the central server at which the information is compared to the pre defined planes stored thereon. If a match is found information associated with the plane is then sent to the device and the user can interact with the content.

The device may also include one or more location and orientation components . Specifically the device may include a GPS receiver that communicates with GPS satellites to determine a longitude and latitude location of the device a three axis accelerometer that measures pitch roll and yaw movement of the device a magnetometer that measures directional orientation with respect to the magnetic field of the Earth and potentially a gyroscope to assist in the maintenance of the orientation. In some instances indoor positioning systems or supporting applications may also be used to determine a location within a mall stadium casino large retail establishment airport or other building. Examples of approaches include for example WiFi triangulation or fingerprinting radio beaconing Bluetooth radios combining outdoor GPS data with movement and orientation data from the device programmed LED lighting systems indoor mapping cellular tower signals and surveillance camera data.

As a user of the mobile device moves about his physical environment e.g. walks down a street through a mall along a trail etc. the user selectively points the device at the physical locale of interest to initiate interactions with the associated virtual locale to explore content related to the physical locale . The physical locale may be a physical object such as a building billboard storefront or a naturally occurring element of landscape e.g. a lake beach mountain etc. . By standing in a particular location pointing the device in a particular direction and tilting the device at an angle with respect to the ground data may be collected from the location components and orientation components of the device to determine its location and orientation with respect to the real physical world.

The mobile device may be programmed with an application program to transmit geolocation and geospatial data from the device to a server . The server may include a communications server platform such as the Apache Web Server WebSphere from IBM to manage incoming requests from the mobile device and or application and outbound responses thereto. The server may also include an application server for executing stored application code that implements the methods described herein. A content server and data storage server provide storage for the spatial virtual locale definitions corresponding structured navigation related meta data HTML template layouts web page elements electronic content images audio and video feeds user data advertisements logging and usage data as well as other information used to implement manage and monitor the system. In summary the server receives geospatial data from the mobile device and based on a match or near match between the geospatial data and geospatial data relating to virtual locales identifies one or more virtual locales that appear to be within the view of the device . Additional content may be delivered to the device based on such a match such that the user may view and interact with the associated content.

The mobile device and server communicate with each other as well as other devices and data sources via a network . The network communication may take place via any media such as standard and or cellular telephone lines LAN or WAN links e.g. T1 T3 56 kb X.25 broadband connections ISDN Frame Relay ATM wireless links and so on. Preferably the network can carry TCP IP protocol communications and HTTP HTTPS requests made by the mobile device and the connection between the mobile device and the server can be communicated over such networks. In some implementations the network includes various cellular data networks such as 2G 3G 4G and others. The type of network is not limited however and any suitable network may be used. Typical examples of networks that can serve as the communications network 121605 include a wireless or wired Ethernet based intranet a local or wide area network LAN or WAN and or the global communications network known as the Internet which may accommodate many different communications media and protocols.

Separately from the application residing on the mobile device and using a device that has the capability to report and record three dimensional position values from a coordinate system defined in relation to the physical world the position and orientation of two dimensional planes or three dimensional volumes are defined as virtual locales. These spatial definitions can be static dynamically changing or dynamically defined relative to an object that can move spatially within the three dimensional physical world. Generally the defined geospatial coordinates of the virtual locales include longitude and latitude values to pinpoint the critical perimeter locations of two dimensional planes or three dimensional volumes as well as an altitude relative to the ground plane at the specific location to distinguish multiple virtual locales that may be at the same location and to provide a more accurate intersection with the field of view of the mobile device . In some instances a time element may be stored along with the geospatial data and used as an additional filter to determine the appropriate content for deliver. For example a billboard may be scheduled to be updated with a new movie advertisement in a week s time and to avoid having to update the database at the instant the new billboard is visible a date timestamp can be used to identify when the system should select one virtual locale versus another.

In some instances especially those in which the density of the virtual locales is low i.e. there is a significant amount of white space between virtual locales the geospatial data elements that define the virtual locales may be expanded to take up the white space so that the intersection space is larger than the physical dimensions of the physical locale. In some cases the expansion of the geospatial dimensions includes a set distance e.g. an additional 20 feet in each direction whereas in other cases the dimensions are expanded until they bump up against other defined virtual locales effectively filling in all available space. In more specific cases the entities owning or paying for the virtual locales can purchase the additional space to expand the reach of their advertisements and spatial footprint so long as it does not overlap other virtual locales.

The determination of the intersection between the smart device generated field of view and the pre defined two dimensional planes three dimensional volumes is based on three dimensional Cartesian calculations assuming that both the directional vector and the two dimensional planes three dimensional volumes are being defined based on the same real world relative coordinate system. In one embodiment intersections among shapes or virtual locales residing in close proximity to structural representations of the physical world are calculated as opposed to intersections with shapes or virtual locales aligned with the structural representations themselves. This allows the shape orientation and position of the recognized virtual locales to change over time as they are not fixed to the physical world but rather are defined relative to the physical world.

The techniques described herein are applicable to both indoor and outdoor uses. In cases where indoor use is contemplated the device uses various sensors capable of calculating the orientation of the device relative to the surrounding physical world including both indoor positioning systems IPS and outdoors GPS . Further a single device uses intermittent connectivity to remote servers that host the two dimensional and three dimensional virtual locale definitions related to the surrounding physical world.

IP addresses URLs URIs and other content identification information are stored in the server . The database holds the relationships between the specific two dimensional planes three dimensional volumes and the content identification information that is to be returned to the smart device upon intersection of the smart device field of view and the virtual locale spatial definition.

Additional categorical data can be entered into the relational database in order to allow for multiple IP addresses to be assigned to a single two dimensional plane or three dimensional volume. User generated input defining the desired category may be passed form the smart device to further inform the query of the relational database. As a result the process can be utilized to associate relationships between web pages and fixed locations trackable moving objects trackable people etc. with the possible physical locales being either analog or digital objects.

For example for a user standing at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Streets in Los Angeles facing towards the Pacific Ocean and holding their phone at a slightly tilted angle to aim at a billboard the geolocation and orientation data may be expressed as a vector such as 34.10150 118.3269 270 30 where the first two values are the latitude and longitude the third value a direction due west and the last a tilt value. Based on this data a field of view of the device may be calculated as an angular extension of the device. The field of view may have a set lateral angular span e.g. 45 degrees or the user may set the span to allow for a more accurate or broader field of view depending on the surroundings. The field of view may also have a defined elevational angular span thus defining the height of the field of view and a radius to constrain the radial reach of the field of view.

Returning to once the geospatial information that defines the field of view is determined it is sent to the central server STEP . Based on the coordinates of the field of view and the geospatial coordinates of the virtual locales stored in the database one or more virtual locale s are identified as potential matches STEP . In some instances a match is determined based on exact match between the coordinates whereas in other cases a threshold range is applied such that virtual locales deemed close are identified. Additional filter criteria may also be considered in qualifying virtual locales such as the distance from the device to the virtual locale geographic region time of day and or date ranges associated with the virtual locale meta data associated with the virtual locale IP verification matching etc. Once a virtual locale is identified content associated with the virtual locale is retrieved from the content server STEP . The content may be a URL URI related to the physical locale e.g. the store s website or a streaming IP camera an advertisement for a product being offered a collection of structured data e.g. menu driven content machine readable instructions e.g. external smart appliance control computer code or some combination thereof. The content is transmitted back to the application on the device STEP .

The application then determines the orientation of the device STEP to detect intersections of the field of view of the device and the various virtual locales within the area of the user STEP .

Once on the device the list of virtual locales and associated content may be displayed to the user on the display component STEP . In instances in which the content includes more than a single item e.g. a menu of options the user may provide navigational commands to the application STEP to navigate through the list of virtual locales STEP and have the display be updated in real time based on the input commands. In some cases in which the content includes a URL selection of that item by the user opens a browser session on the device and requests the web page associated with the URL STEP for display. The display of the web page may be within the application effectively replacing the content received from the server or in a separate browser session such that the user can return to the application and continue to navigate through the content. In other cases in which the content includes server connectivity instructions or machine executable code selection of that item by the user establishes a connection with a server STEP that is related to the physical locale being pointed at thus allowing interaction between the device and the particular computer enabled device identified by the corresponding virtual locale.

In certain cases a distance between the device and the nearest or cluster of nearest virtual locales may be captured and used to evaluate qualifying virtual locales to influence the size of the field of view to filter based on distance and or to determine the type of virtual locales content presented to a user. For example if the user were on top of a mountain and pointing at various regions of a city skyline from a mile away then large virtual locales surrounding the respective neighborhoods are be considered as possible intersections rather than the smaller virtual locales related to individual stores at a street level. Conversely if the user is standing five feet from a virtual locale then smaller more precise virtual locales are considered. This distance aware filtering is a powerful aspect to the experience that helps to capture the context aware intent from the user.

In some cases and as shown in an additional dimension may be used to define the field of view as a three dimensional shape. In these cases in addition to the two dimensional planar field of view an elevational angular span may be specified thus creating a rectangular projection of the field of view.

In response to the identification of one or more virtual locales content is identified and sent to the device for the user to review interact with and manipulate using commands inherent to the device. Referring to a list of executable commands is created and displayed on the display of the smart device in response to the information received from the server.

In some implementations and still with reference to users of the smart device are able to navigate hierarchical menu options associated with a pre defined virtual locale. The device is held according to a calculated directional vector which is determined by the orientational detection components of the device itself. In additional icons representing software applications or optional selections that may be instantiated by the user . In some cases haptic commands may be used to provide input to the device such as touching an icon sliding a finger across the screen pinching the screen re orienting the device moving the device within the world coordinate system or others.

For example the user interface or interactive mobile web page on the display of a mobile smart device may change based on the intersection of the mobile device calculated directional vector calculated relative to the device defined in physical world coordinates with virtual geometry that has been defined relative to the physical world. The specific executable command to be transferred is determined based on past user hyper link actions giving the most frequently executed commands the highest priority . As the user continues to depress the display screen on his device as the directional vector leaves the intersection with the plane i.e. the user is pointing the phone in another direction a list item displaying descriptive information is displayed and remains on the smart device .

In some cases additional filtering may be applied to the list of virtual locales content related to the virtual locales or both. For example filters such as a radius of interest user specific metadata time of day etc. and or a weighting priority factor may be used especially in areas of high virtual locale density.

Referring now to if the directional vector enters and leaves multiple planes while the smart display is continually depressed then a list is created on the display of the smart device with each item containing information relative to the corresponding planes that were intersected . As an example if while continuing to depress the application icon the user slides their finger up or towards the perceived top of the smart display menu options appear and auto toggle through a first level of the corresponding navigation menu. Other exemplary motions include sliding the user s finger to the right and back to select the displayed menu item and sliding the user s finger to the left and back to jump up one level in the associated menu hierarchy. In this manner the user of the smart device is able to navigate menus options defined in a hierarchical format as they manipulate the device with respect to the virtual locales associated with the content.
