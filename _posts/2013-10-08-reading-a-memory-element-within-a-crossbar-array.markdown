The present application is a divisional application of Ser. No. 12 788 161 filed on May 26 2010 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 570 785 issued on 29 Oct. 2013 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention has been made with government support under Contract No. HR0011 09 3 0001 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The government has certain rights in the invention.

As the use of digital data increases the demand for faster smaller and more efficient memory structures increases. One type of memory structure which has recently been developed is a crossbar memory structure. A crossbar memory structure includes a set of upper parallel wires which intersect a set of lower parallel wires. A programmable memory element configured to store digital data is placed at each intersection of the wires.

One type of programmable memory element which may be used is a memristive element. A memristive element is a device which changes the state of its resistance based on an applied programming condition. For example a programming condition may be applied to change the memristive element from a high resistive state to a low resistive state or vice versa. A high resistive state may represent a digital 1 and a low resistive state may represent a digital 0 .

One challenge that results from use of a crossbar memory structure is the process of reading the state of a target memory element within the crossbar array. The state of a memory element may be determined by applying a sense voltage to the target memory element. Then the electric current flowing through the target memory element will be indicative of the resistive state of the target memory element. However when applying a sense voltage to a target memory element the electric current flowing from the target memory element will be adversely affected by the half selected memory elements within the crossbar array. Thus it is difficult to isolate the electric current flowing through the target memory element that is resulting from only the applied sense voltage across the target memory element.

Throughout the drawings identical reference numbers designate similar but not necessarily identical elements.

As mentioned above one challenge that results from use of a crossbar memory structure is the process of reading the state of a target memory element. The state of a memory element may be determined by applying a sense voltage to a target memory element. The electric current flowing through the target memory element will then be indicative of the resistive state of the target memory element. However when applying a sense voltage to a target memory element the electric current flowing from the target memory element will be adversely affected by the half selected memory elements within the crossbar array. Thus it is difficult to isolate the electric current flowing through the target memory element that is resulting from only the applied sense voltage across the target memory element.

One solution has been to use isolation elements such as diodes or transistors which may selectively inhibit the flow of electric current from unselected and half selected memory elements. However this approach requires the use of several additional electronic components for each memory element. The additional components prohibit the memory structure from being designed with a higher memory density. Other solutions include a two step process in which the noise current from the unselected and half selected memory elements within the array is cancelled out. However this method may slow down the read process as two steps are required.

In light of these and other issues the present specification discloses a method for accurately sensing the state of a selected memory device without the need for such isolation elements or two step processes.

For purposes of illustration the two sets of intersecting parallel lines of a crossbar array will be referred to as row lines and column lines. Either the row or column lines may be the upper or lower lines.

According to certain illustrative examples a target memory element is selected by switching a column line connected to the target memory element to a current mirror input. Additionally a sense voltage is applied to the row line connected to the target memory element. The sense voltage will then be applied across the target memory element causing an electric current to flow through the target memory element and to the current mirror connected to the column line. However the electric current flowing from the target memory element will be adversely affected by other memory elements referred to as half selected memory elements along the selected column line connected to the target memory element. Thus the electric current flowing into the current mirror will not only include the electric current flowing through the target memory element but will also include a noise current flowing through the half selected memory elements within the crossbar array.

In order to accurately determine the resistive state of the target memory element a substantial portion of the electric current received into the current mirror should be from the target memory element and not the half selected memory elements within the crossbar array. To accomplish this bias voltages are applied to the row lines not connected to the target memory element. These bias voltages may be referred to as error voltages as they are used to reduce the error in the electric current received into the current mirror. The error voltage may be designed to be relatively equal to the output voltage of the current mirror.

With the error voltages applied to the row lines not connected to the target memory element being relatively equal to the output voltage of the current mirror an equipotential isolation occurs. This equipotential isolation of the half selected memory elements effectively reduces the aforementioned noise current to a negligible level. Thus the current flowing into the current mirror will primarily include the current flowing from the target memory element. Thus the current flowing into the current mirror will be indicative of the resistive state of the target memory element.

Through use of a system or method embodying principles described herein the state of a target memory element within a crossbar array may be determined without the need for isolation elements. Without isolation elements a memory structure with a higher density may be realized. The higher memory density allows more data to be stored within a smaller physical amount of space. Additionally the read process may be performed without the need for a two step process in which the error current is stored in a storage element. This will decrease the needed read time and increase the performance of the circuitry reading the resistive state of memory elements within the crossbar array.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present systems and methods. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present apparatus systems and methods may be practiced without these specific details. Reference in the specification to an embodiment an example or similar language means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment or example is included in at least that one embodiment but not necessarily in other embodiments. The various instances of the phrase in one embodiment or similar phrases in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Throughout this specification and in the appended claims the term memory structure is to be broadly interpreted as the physical structure of an electronic circuit designed to store digital data. A memory structure may include a number of programmable devices configured to be set to a number of different states.

Throughout this specification and in the appended claims the term crossbar array is to be broadly interpreted as a number of lower wire lines intersecting a number of upper wire lines. A programmable logic device is disposed at each crosspoint between an upper wire segment and a lower wire segment.

Throughout this specification and in the appended claims the term memory element is to be broadly interpreted as a component configured to be programmed with a value or state and maintain that value or state to be read at a later time.

Throughout this specification and in the appended claims the terms row lines and column lines are used to differentiate between a first set of parallel lines intersecting a second set of parallel lines. Either the row or column lines may be the upper set of lines in any particular application.

Referring now to the figures is a diagram showing an illustrative crossbar memory architecture . According to certain illustrative examples the crossbar architecture may include an upper set of lines which may generally be in parallel. Additionally a lower set of lines is generally perpendicular to and intersects the upper lines . Programmable crosspoint or memory devices are formed at the intersections between an upper line and a lower line .

According to certain illustrative examples the programmable crosspoint devices may be memristive devices. Memristive devices exhibit a memory of past electrical conditions. For example a memristive device may include a matrix material which contains mobile dopants. These dopants can be moved within a matrix to dynamically alter the electrical operation of an electrical device.

The motion of dopants can be induced by the application of a programming condition such as an applied electrical voltage across a suitable matrix. The programming voltage generates a relatively high electrical field through the memristive matrix and alters the distribution of dopants. After removal of the electrical field the location and characteristics of the dopants remain stable until the application of another programming electrical field. For example by changing the dopant configurations within a memristive matrix the electrical resistance of the device may be altered. The memristive device is read by applying a lower reading voltage which allows the internal electrical resistance of the memristive device to be sensed but does not generate a high enough electrical field to cause significant dopant motion. Consequently the state of the memristive device may remain stable over long time periods and through multiple read cycles.

According to certain illustrative examples the crossbar architecture may be used to form a non volatile memory array. Non volatile memory has the characteristic of not losing its contents when no power is being supplied. Each of the programmable crosspoint devices is used to represent one or more bits of data. Although individual crossbar lines in are shown with rectangular cross sections crossbars may also have square circular elliptical or more complex cross sections. The lines may also have many different widths diameters aspect ratios and or eccentricities. The crossbars may be nanowires sub microscale wires microscale wires or wires with larger dimensions.

According to certain illustrative examples the crossbar architecture may be integrated into a Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor CMOS circuit or other conventional computer circuitry. Each individual wire segment may be connected to the CMOS circuitry by a via . The via may be embodied as an electrically conductive path through the various substrate materials used in manufacturing the crossbar architecture. This CMOS circuitry can provide additional functionality to the memristive device such as input output functions buffering logic configuration or other functionality. Multiple crossbar arrays can be formed over the CMOS circuitry to create a multilayer circuit.

As mentioned above when selecting a target memory element to be read it is difficult to isolate the voltage which has been affected by the target memory element alone. Consequently the present specification discloses methods and systems for reading the state of a target memory element without the need for isolation elements.

According to certain illustrative examples a target memory element is selected by switching the column line connected to the target memory element to a current mirror . This column line may be referred to as the selected column . A sense voltage is then applied to a row line connected to the target memory element . This row line may be referred to as the selected row . This will cause an electric current to flow through the target memory element and into the current mirror . The current mirror output may then be used to determine the resistive state of the target memory element .

The following is a detailed description of the principles at work in the circuit illustrated in . Particularly the following describes the manner in which the electric current flowing from the target memory element is prevented from being adversely affected by noise currents from half selected memory elements.

To select the column line connected to the target memory element a select switch is used to switch the selected column line to the current mirror input. The select switch may be any commonly used electrical switching device such as a transistor. With the selected column line switched to the current mirror input each memory element along the selected column becomes half selected. The sense voltage is then applied to the selected row . With the sense voltage applied each memory element along the selected row becomes half selected except for the target memory element which becomes fully selected. The rest of the memory elements within the crossbar array may be referred to as the unselected memory elements . The unselected memory elements are connected to both unselected column lines and unselected row lines .

With the target memory element fully selected the sense voltage will be applied across the target memory element causing an electric current to flow through the target memory element and to the current mirror input. As mentioned above this electric current will be adversely affected by the half selected memory elements along the selected column line . Particularly a voltage formed across the current mirror circuit will cause a noise current to flow through the half selected memory elements . This noise current will then be added to the current flowing into the current mirror . Thus the input current of the current mirror is not an entirely accurate representation of the current flowing through the target memory element .

To compensate for this error voltages are applied to the unselected rows of the crossbar array . The error voltages may be designed to match the voltage formed across the current mirror . This voltage formed across the current mirror may be referred to as an output voltage of the current mirror . By matching the error voltages to the output voltage of the current mirror an equipotential isolation of the half selected memory elements occurs. This equipotential isolation which will be described in more detail below will effectively reduce the noise currents from the half selected memory elements to a negligible level. Thus the input current to the current mirror will not be adversely affected by the half selected memory elements beyond a negligible level.

When the input current flows into the current mirror it flows across a sense transistor . This flow of current across the sense transistor creates a voltage across the sense transistor . This voltage is essentially the output voltage of the current mirror . It is this voltage that the error voltages are designed to match. In accordance with Kirchhoff s Voltage Law this voltage will also be applied across the mirror transistor . The voltage across the mirror transistor will cause an electric current to flow through the mirror transistor . This electric current may be referred to as the output current .

If the physical characteristics of the mirror transistor match the physical properties of the sense transistor then the output current will match the input current . In some cases the physical characteristics of the mirror transistor may be different than the physical characteristics of the sense transistor . This will cause the output current to be a scaled value of the input current . The output current may thus be scaled appropriately if desired to suit the design of the sensing and reading circuitry used to measure the output current .

Sensing circuitry will then use the output current of the current mirror to determine the resistive state of the target memory element the resistive state of the target memory element being indicative of the data stored in the target memory element . Data is typically stored in a digital format. In a digital format only two discrete values are represented a digital 1 and a digital 0 . The resistive state of a memory element may represent either a 1 or a 0 . For example a high resistive state may represent a 0 and a low resistive state may represent 1 or vice versa

In some cases the difference between a high resistive state and a low resistive state may be a factor of 100 or more. For example if a memory element is in a low resistive state it may have a resistance of 100 ohms. In a high resistive state the memory element may have a resistance of 10 000 ohms. Thus it may not be necessary to determine the exact resistance of a target memory element. Rather the relative resistance may be sufficient to determine whether the target memory element is representing a digital 1 or a digital 0 .

The selected memory element resistance represents the resistance of a fully selected memory element within a crossbar array. This resistance is dependent upon the resistive state of the selected memory element. The equivalent resistance of the half selected memory elements represents the combined resistance of each half selected memory element along the selected column e.g. . Together the selected memory element resistance and the half selected memory element equivalent resistance form a current divider circuit.

The electric current flowing across the selected memory element resistance which may be referred to as the memory element current can be expressed by the following equation Equation 1 

As will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art as the sense voltage Vincreases the memory element current Iincreases as well.

The total electric current flowing through the half selected memory element equivalent resistance which may be referred to as a noise current may be expressed by the following equation Equation 2 

As will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art as the error voltage Vapproaches the output voltage V the noise current Iapproaches zero. As mentioned above the error voltage is designed to match the output voltage . This ideally brings the noise current close to zero. In practical circuits the error voltage does not completely match the output voltage . However it is close enough that any resulting noise current is considered negligible.

The sense current is a sum of the memory element current plus the noise current . Thus when the noise current is minimized due to the equipotential isolation resulting from the error voltage matching the output voltage the sense current primarily includes the memory element current flowing through the target memory element. The sense current is then input into a current mirror in accordance with the principles described above.

If no error voltage were applied to the row lines connected to the half selected memory elements the output voltage which results from switching the selected column line to the current mirror would cause a substantial noise current to flow through the half selected memory elements. This noise current would adversely affect the input current of the current mirror leading to an unreliable measurement.

According to certain illustrative examples a voltage V may be applied to a non linear element. A first electric current illustrated by the upper horizontal dotted line is the electric current value passing through the non linear element with a voltage of V applied. If a smaller voltage V is applied a second electric current illustrated by the lower horizontal dotted line will flow through the non linear element. If the second voltage is half the first voltage then the second current will be much smaller than half the first electric current flowing through the non linear element when V is applied. This non linear relationship allows error voltages to be applied to unselected row lines within the crossbar array without overly affecting the electric current sensed from a selected memory element.

For example if a sense voltage of V is applied to a selected line and the resulting output voltage of the current mirror is equal to V the error voltage may be set to V the cumulative electric currents from several unselected row lines may still be less than the electric current flowing through the target memory element as a result of sense voltage V being applied to the row line connected to the target memory element.

In sum through use of a system or method embodying principles described herein the state of a target memory element within a crossbar array may be determined without the need for isolation elements. Without isolation elements a memory structure with a higher density may be realized. The higher memory density allows more data to be stored within a smaller physical amount of space. Additionally the read process may be performed without the need for a two step process in which the error current is stored in a storage element. This will increase the read time and performance of the circuitry reading the resistive state of memory elements within the crossbar array.

The preceding description has been presented only to illustrate and describe examples and examples of the principles described. This description is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit these principles to any precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.
