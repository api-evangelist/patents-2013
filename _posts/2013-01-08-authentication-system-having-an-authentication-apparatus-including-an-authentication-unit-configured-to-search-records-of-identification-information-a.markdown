In an organization such as a company an image forming apparatus e.g. a multifunction peripheral including a facsimile function a scanning function and a copying function is often connected via a network to plural computer terminals to share the image forming apparatus. In such an environment it is necessary to maintain the security of image data handled on the network.

The biometric authentication information may include a group ID a user ID biometric information a password an email address and a facsimile number. The information items in the biometric authentication information may be added or removed except those used for authentication.

Referring back to the biometric authentication unit performs biometric authentication based on biometric information and selected user information that are sent from the image forming apparatus together with a biometric authentication request. Details of a biometric authentication process are described later.

As illustrated in the biometric authentication server connecting unit of the image forming apparatus sends a group information acquisition request to the image forming apparatus connecting unit of the authentication server at predetermined timing e.g. when the image forming apparatus is turned on or at regular intervals step S .

The image forming apparatus connecting unit obtains group information from the group information storing unit step S and sends the obtained group information to the biometric authentication server connecting unit . The biometric authentication server connecting unit receives the group information and stores the received group information in the group information storing unit step S .

Next the biometric authentication server connecting unit requests the screen generation unit to update or generate a screen step S . The screen generation unit obtains the group information from the group information storing unit step S and generates a new group selection screen based on the obtained group information step S .

After generating the new group selection screen the screen generation unit requests the screen display unit to display the new group selection screen step S . In response the screen display unit displays the new group selection screen.

As illustrated in the user selects a group to which the user belongs on the group selection screen displayed on the image forming apparatus step S . Next the user holds for example a finger or a palm over the biometric information reading device step S . When detecting the finger or the palm the biometric information reading device sends event information which indicates that the finger or the palm is held over the biometric information reading device to the image forming apparatus step S .

When receiving the event information the image forming apparatus requests the biometric information reading device to capture biometric information step S . Next the image forming apparatus sends a biometric authentication request including the captured biometric information sent from the biometric information reading device and selected group information indicating the group selected in step S step S .

The biometric authentication server performs biometric information based on the captured biometric information and the selected group information in the biometric authentication request and sends an authentication result to the image forming apparatus . When the authentication result from the biometric authentication server indicates success successfully authenticated the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S . Meanwhile when the authentication result indicates failure authentication has failed the image forming apparatus prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus .

First the user selects a group to which the user belongs on the group selection screen displayed on the image forming apparatus step S . As a result the screen input receiving unit receives selected group information indicating the selected group. The screen input receiving unit stores the selected group information in the biometric authentication server connecting unit step S .

Next the user holds for example a finger or a palm over the biometric information obtaining unit of the biometric information reading device step S . When detecting the finger or the palm the biometric information obtaining unit sends event information which indicates that the finger or the palm is held over the biometric information obtaining unit to the biometric information reading device control unit of the image forming apparatus step S .

When receiving the event information the biometric information reading device control unit requests the image forming apparatus connecting unit of the biometric information reading device to obtain biometric information step S .

Then the image forming apparatus connecting unit requests the biometric information obtaining unit to capture biometric information step S . The biometric information obtaining unit captures biometric information and sends the captured biometric information to the image forming apparatus connecting unit and the image forming apparatus connecting unit sends the captured biometric information to the biometric information reading device control unit .

The biometric information reading device control unit of the image forming apparatus sends a biometric authentication request including the captured biometric information to the biometric authentication server connecting unit step S .

The biometric authentication server connecting unit obtains the selected group information indicating a group selected by the user step S . Next the biometric authentication server connecting unit sends a biometric authentication request including the captured biometric information and the selected group information to the image forming apparatus connecting unit of the biometric authentication server step S .

Next the image forming apparatus connecting unit sends the captured biometric information and the selected group information to the biometric authentication unit step S .

The biometric authentication unit searches the biometric authentication information storing unit based on the captured biometric information and the selected group information to find biometric information matching the captured biometric information from sets or records of biometric information belonging to the group indicated by the selected group information step S . When matching biometric information is found the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result success and user information corresponding to the found biometric information. Meanwhile when matching biometric information is not found the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result failure . In the example of it is assumed that matching biometric information is found.

Step is described in more detail below. For example the biometric authentication unit extracts records including the selected group information i.e. a group ID from the biometric authentication information see for example stored in the biometric authentication storing unit . Next the biometric authentication unit selects the extracted records one at a time and compares the captured biometric information with biometric information in each of the records. When a matching record including biometric information that matches the captured biometric information is found the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result success and user information obtained from the matching record. Meanwhile when no record including biometric information that matches the captured biometric information is found the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result failure .

Thus the biometric authentication unit searches only records biometric authentication information of users belonging to a group identified by the selected group information.

The biometric authentication unit sends the authentication result and the user information to the image forming apparatus connecting unit and the image forming apparatus connecting unit sends the authentication result and the user information to the biometric authentication server connecting unit of the image forming apparatus .

The biometric authentication server connecting unit registers the user information in the user information storing unit step S . When the authentication result is success the biometric authentication server connecting unit allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S .

A second exemplary biometric authentication process P includes in addition to the steps described with reference to a step of requesting the user to input additional user information e.g. user ID to more accurately authenticate the user.

After step S the biometric authentication server performs authentication according to a biometric authentication request received in step S step S . The biometric authentication server performs biometric authentication based on captured biometric information and selected group information received from the image forming apparatus and the biometric authentication information stored in the biometric authentication information storing unit . Then the biometric authentication server sends an authentication result success failure or confirmation to the image forming apparatus . When the authentication result is other than failure the biometric authentication server sends user information together with the authentication result. Details of step S is described later with reference to B A and B.

When the authentication result from the biometric authentication server is success the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S . When the authentication result is failure the image forming apparatus prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus step S . When the authentication result is confirmation the image forming apparatus displays a user information input screen step S .

When the user inputs user information e.g. a user ID on the user information input screen displayed in step S step S the image forming apparatus performs an additional authentication step. The image forming apparatus determines whether the entered user information is present in the user information sent from the biometric authentication server step S . When the entered user information is present in the user information sent from the biometric authentication server the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S . Meanwhile when the entered user information is not present in the user information sent from the biometric authentication server the image forming apparatus prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus .

In the process of the biometric authentication server searches the biometric authentication information storing unit based on captured biometric information and selected group information received from the image forming apparatus to find biometric information matching the captured biometric information from sets of biometric information belonging to a group indicated by the selected group information. In other words the biometric authentication server compares the captured biometric information with sets of biometric information that are stored in the biometric authentication information storing unit and belonging to a group indicated by the selected group information. The biometric authentication server calculates the matching rates or degrees of similarity of the sets of biometric information belonging to the group with the captured biometric information and identify biometric information whose matching rate is greater than or equal to 90 step S .

When no biometric information with a matching rate greater than or equal to 90 is found NO in step S the biometric authentication server sets failure as the authentication result. In other words when the matching rates of all sets of biometric information belonging to the group are less than 90 NO in step S the biometric authentication server sets failure as the authentication result.

When one or more sets of biometric information with matching rates greater than or equal to 90 are found YES in step S the biometric authentication server determines the number of the sets of biometric information found i.e. the number of users corresponding to the sets of biometric information with matching rates greater than or equal to 90 step S . When the number of users is greater than or equal to two in step S the biometric authentication server sets confirmation as the authentication result.

Meanwhile when the number of users is one in step S the biometric authentication server determines whether the matching rate of the corresponding biometric information is greater than or equal to 95 step S . When the matching rate is greater than or equal to 95 YES in step S the biometric authentication server sets the authentication result as success . Meanwhile when the matching rate is less than 95 i.e. greater than or equal to 90 and less than 95 NO in step S the biometric authentication server sets the authentication result as confirmation .

Here an exemplary method of calculating the matching rate of biometric information is described. For example when a fingerprint image is used as biometric information the fingerprint image is divided into plural areas. The areas of a fingerprint image received from the image forming apparatus are compared with the corresponding areas of a fingerprint image stored in the biometric authentication information storing unit . The matching rate can be obtained by calculating the percentage of matching areas of the fingerprint images.

The percentages 90 95 used as thresholds of matching rates in the above process are just examples and the thresholds may be set at any appropriate values. For example graded matching levels may be defined in advance. In this case the matching rates of sets of biometric information stored in the biometric authentication information storing unit with the captured biometric information may be classified into the graded matching levels and biometric information with matching rates in one of the graded matching levels may be output.

For example matching rate 95 in the above process may be replaced with highest matching level and matching rate 90 may be replaced with second highest matching level . Also in matching rate 90 in step S may be replaced with highest matching level or second highest matching level and matching rate 95 in step S may be replaced with highest matching level . Similarly in matching rate 95 in step S may be replaced with highest matching level and 90 matching rate

In the process of the biometric authentication server searches the biometric authentication information storing unit based on captured biometric information and selected group information received from the image forming apparatus to find biometric information matching the captured biometric information from sets of biometric information belonging to a group indicated by the selected group information. In other words the biometric authentication server compares the captured biometric information with sets of biometric information that are stored in the biometric authentication information storing unit and belonging to a group indicated by the selected group information. The biometric authentication server calculates the matching rates or degrees of similarity of the sets of biometric information belonging to the group with the captured biometric information. Then the biometric authentication server determines whether there is one or more sets of biometric information whose matching rate is greater than or equal to 95 step S .

When one or more sets of biometric information with matching rates greater than or equal to 95 are found YES in step S the biometric authentication server determines the number of the sets of biometric information found i.e. the number of users corresponding to the sets of biometric information with matching rates greater than or equal to 95 step S . When the number of users is one in step S the biometric authentication server sets success as the authentication result. Meanwhile when the number of users is greater than or equal to two in step S the biometric authentication server sets confirmation as the authentication result.

Meanwhile when there is no biometric information with a matching rate greater than or equal to 95 i.e. when the matching rates of all sets of biometric information belonging to the group are less than 95 NO in step S the biometric authentication server determines whether there is biometric information belonging to the group whose matching rate is greater than or equal to 90 and less than 95 step S . When there is biometric information with a matching rate greater than or equal to 90 and less than 95 YES in step S the biometric authentication server sets the authentication result as confirmation . Meanwhile there is no biometric information with a matching rate greater than or equal to 90 and less than 95 NO in step S the biometric authentication server sets the authentication result as failure .

Thus when one set of biometric information with a matching rate greater than or equal to 95 and two or more sets of biometric information with matching rates greater than or equal to 90 and less than 95 are found the authentication result is set as confirmation in but is set as success in . As described above the thresholds of matching rates used to determine the authentication result can be set freely.

In the process of when the number of users corresponding to biometric information with matching rates that satisfy conditions for confirmation or success is greater than one the authentication result is set as confirmation to request the user to enter user information even if biometric information of only one user satisfies the condition for success .

Meanwhile in the process of when the number of users corresponding to biometric information with matching rates that satisfy the condition for success is one the authentication result is set as success even if biometric information of more than one user satisfies the condition for confirmation .

In the above exemplary processes three types of authentication results success failure and confirmation are used. However the types or the number of authentication results are not limited to those described above. For example the authentication result may be set as success when the matching rate is greater than or equal to 95 and set as confirmation when the matching rate is less than 95 .

Also the second exemplary biometric authentication process P is not necessarily based on the first exemplary biometric authentication process P . For example the second exemplary biometric authentication process P may be performed based only on the captured biometric information received from the image forming apparatus . In other words instead of comparing captured biometric information with sets of biometric information belonging to a selected group the captured biometric information may be compared with all sets of biometric information stored in the biometric authentication information storing unit . In the second exemplary biometric authentication process P biometric authentication is combined with authentication based on input user information to improve the accuracy and efficiency of authentication.

In biometric authentication such as fingerprint authentication biometric information obtained from the same user may not always be the same. For example there may be a case where it becomes difficult to correctly capture a fingerprint of a user after the user performs a certain task. As a result the same user may be successfully authenticated at one occasion but not successfully authenticated at another occasion. Instead of determining success or failure based only on biometric authentication combining biometric authentication with another authentication method makes it possible to more flexibly and efficiently perform authentication.

Although biometric authentication and authentication based on input user information are combined in the second exemplary biometric authentication process P biometric authentication may be combined with any other authentication method such as authentication using a card. That is the above described approach may be applied to an authentication system where different authentication methods i.e. a first authentication method and a second authentication method are used in combination. In such an authentication system an authentication result of the first authentication method may be used when the authentication result is success and authentication based on the second authentication method may be performed when the authentication result is not success .

Also more than two authentication methods may be combined or an authentication method may be selected from plural authentication methods based on the authentication result of the first authentication method. In this case conditions corresponding to respective authentication methods may be defined. For example when the matching rate of biometric information in biometric authentication first authentication method is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 85 confirmation may be performed based on a second authentication method. When the matching rate of biometric information in the first authentication method is greater than or equal to 85 and less than 90 confirmation may be performed based on a third authentication method. When the matching rate of biometric information in the first authentication method is greater than or equal to 90 and less than 95 confirmation may be performed based on a fourth authentication method.

In the above embodiments the biometric authentication server performs authentication processes and stores authentication information. However the configuration of an authentication system is not limited to that described above. For example an authentication system may include a target apparatus such as an image forming apparatus whose user is to be authenticated and two or more servers information processing apparatuses that collaborate and communicate with each other to perform authentication processes and store authentication information.

A first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P is described below with reference to .

The functional configuration of is different from the functional configuration of in that the biometric authentication unit of the biometric authentication server is replaced with a condition matching user reporting unit and a biometric authentication unit is added to the image forming apparatus . Other components of the authentication system AS of are substantially the same as those of the authentication system AS of . The biometric authentication unit may be implemented by executing a program installed in the image forming apparatus by the processor .

The process of is different from the process of in steps SA and SB. Instead of step S of the condition matching user reporting unit of the biometric authentication server extracts users that match predetermined conditions step SA . Then the condition matching user reporting unit sends user information of the extracted users associated with the corresponding conditions to the image forming apparatus .

When receiving the user information the biometric authentication unit of the image forming apparatus performs authentication as described later step SB . Based on the result of authentication the biometric authentication unit allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S when the authentication result is success prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus step S when the authentication result is failure or displays a user information input screen step S when the authentication result is confirmation . Steps S through S are substantially the same as those of .

Other configurations and operations of the authentication system AS are substantially the same as those of the authentication system AS described with reference to and their descriptions are omitted here.

The predetermined conditions for extracting users are for example matching rate 95 and matching rate 90 . In this case users that match predetermined conditions are users with matching rates greater than or equal to 95 and users with matching rates greater than or equal to 90 . Also in this case the user information of the extracted users sent from the biometric authentication server to the image forming apparatus is for example matching rate 95 user A matching rate 90 users A and B .

When receiving the user information of the extracted users the biometric authentication unit of the image forming apparatus performs authentication according to the flowchart of or B and outputs an authentication result indicating success failure or confirmation .

For example when user information matching rate 95 user A matching rate 90 users A and B is received the result of step S of becomes YES and the result of step S becomes two or more i.e. users A and B . Therefore in this case the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result confirmation .

Meanwhile in the case of when user information matching rate 95 user A matching rate 90 users A and B is received the result of step S becomes YES and the result of step S becomes one i.e. user A . In this case the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result success .

Preferably the predetermined conditions for extracting users may be set freely at the image forming apparatus .

According to the first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to the image forming apparatus includes the biometric authentication unit that has a part of the functions of the biometric authentication unit of the biometric authentication server of . This configuration makes it possible to freely define at the image forming apparatus rules for determining an authentication result based on user information of the extracted users reported from the biometric authentication server . This in turn makes it possible to more flexibly define the rules for determining an authentication result.

A second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P is described below with reference to .

The authentication system AS of is different from the authentication system AS of in that an authentication server is additionally connected to the network NW. The authentication server can communicate via the network NW with the biometric authentication server the image forming apparatuses and the biometric information reading devices . Other configurations of the authentication system AS are substantially the same as those of the authentication system AS of .

The process of is different from the process of in steps SA through SE. Instead of step S of the biometric authentication server extracts users that match a predetermined condition step SA and sends user information of the extracted users to the authentication server . When receiving the user information the authentication server performs authentication step SB . Based on the result of authentication the authentication server sends permission information to the image forming apparatus to allow the user to use the image forming apparatus step SC when the authentication result is success sends non permission information to the image forming apparatus to prevent the user from using the image forming apparatus step SD when the authentication result is failure or requests the image forming apparatus to display a user information input screen step SE when the authentication result is confirmation . In step SE the authentication server sends a user information input request including user information of the extracted users which is sent from the biometric authentication server in step SA to the image forming apparatus .

When receiving the permission information SC the non permission information SD or the user information input request SE the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S when the permission information is received prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus step S when the non permission information is received or displays a user information input screen step S when the user information input request is received .

When the user information input screen is displayed in step S and the user inputs user information e.g. a user ID step S the image forming apparatus performs an additional authentication step. The image forming apparatus determines whether the entered user information is present in the user information of the extracted users received in step SE from the authentication server step S . When the entered user information is present in the user information of the extracted users the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S . Meanwhile when the entered user information is not present in the user information of the extracted users the image forming apparatus prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus .

Other configurations and operations of the authentication system AS are substantially the same as those of the authentication system AS described with reference to and their descriptions are omitted here.

The second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to is different from the first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to in that the functions of the biometric authentication unit of the image forming apparatus of are provided by the authentication server that is connected to the network NW and provided separately from the image forming apparatus . Except this difference the second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P is substantially the same as the first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P .

Preferably the predetermined conditions for extracting users may be set freely at the authentication server .

According to the second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to the authentication server is provided to perform a part of the functions of the biometric authentication unit of the biometric authentication server of . This configuration makes it possible to freely define at the authentication server rules for determining an authentication result based on user information of the extracted users reported from the biometric authentication server . This in turn makes it possible to more flexibly define the rules for determining an authentication result.

The service providing system is for example located in an organization e.g. company that provides a cloud service via the network NW.

The service providing system provides services via the network NW. The service providing system may include an access control apparatus and service providing apparatuses including a service providing apparatus and a service providing apparatus that are connected to each other via a network NW such as a local area network LAN . Although the service providing apparatuses and are used in the descriptions below the number of service providing apparatuses is not limited to two. The access control apparatus the service providing apparatus and the service providing apparatus may have a hardware configuration as illustrated in .

The office is for example an office of a company that uses the service provided by the service providing system . In the office the image forming apparatuses and a firewall are connected to each other via a network NW such as a local area network LAN .

The session management unit manages communication sessions between the service providing system and the image forming apparatuses . The apparatus communication unit controls communications via the networks NW and NW between the service providing system and the image forming apparatuses .

The data processing unit performs processes on data received from the image forming apparatuses and data stored in the data storage . For example the data processing unit converts application data into print data and removes stored data. The data processing unit may be provided in each of the access control apparatus and the service providing apparatuses and .

The company management information storing unit stores information on companies organizations groups and so on related to services provided by the service providing system . The user management information storing unit stores information on users of services provided by the service providing system . As described above the user management information storing unit stores biometric authentication information see including biometric information and user information associated with the biometric information.

The apparatus management information storing unit stores information e.g. company code described later related to apparatuses in a user system environment e.g. an office that use services provided by the service providing system . The data management information storing unit stores information on data stored in the data storage . The data storage stores for example data received from the image forming apparatuses data received from other external apparatuses and data processed based on the received data.

Referring to the image forming apparatus includes an input reception unit an output unit a setting information storing unit a login request unit a service requesting unit and a biometric information reading device control unit . The input reception unit the output unit the login request unit the service requesting unit and the biometric information reading device control unit are implemented by executing one or more programs installed in the image forming apparatus by a processor CPU . For example when the image forming apparatus has a hardware configuration as illustrated in the processor corresponds to the processor . Also when the image forming apparatus has a hardware configuration as illustrated in the setting information storing unit may be implemented by the memory or the secondary storage unit .

The input reception unit receives for example user operations e.g. touch operations and inputs via an operations panel and a keyboard not shown of the image forming apparatus . The login request unit sends a login request to the service providing system . The service requesting unit requests services of the service providing system . The output unit outputs e.g. prints and displays data. The setting information storing unit stores setting information e.g. user information login information for using services of the service providing system . For example login information may include a company code or a company ID for identifying a company to which the image forming apparatus belongs. The biometric information reading device control unit controls the biometric information reading device e.g. requests the biometric information reading device to capture biometric information .

Referring to the biometric information reading device includes an image forming apparatus connecting unit and a biometric information obtaining unit . The biometric information reading device may have a configuration similar to that of the biometric information reading device of . The image forming apparatus connecting unit communicates with the image forming apparatus to receive a request to capture biometric information from and send the captured biometric information to the image forming apparatus . The biometric information obtaining unit obtains or captures biometric information.

The biometric authentication information exemplified in has a configuration similar to that of the biometric authentication information illustrated in except that the group ID field is replaced with a company code field.

Next a first exemplary biometric authentication process P in an authentication system employing a cloud service is described with reference to . The first exemplary biometric authentication process P is similar to the first exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to except that a company code or company ID for identifying a company to which the image forming apparatus belongs is used instead of selected group information . Accordingly in the process of the step of selecting a group by the user is not necessary. The company code or company ID is another example of group information for identifying a group to which a user belongs .

Referring to the user holds for example a finger or a palm over the biometric information obtaining unit of the biometric information reading device step S . When detecting the finger or the palm the biometric information obtaining unit sends event information which indicates that the finger or the palm is held over the biometric information obtaining unit to the biometric information reading device control unit of the image forming apparatus via the image forming apparatus connecting unit step S .

When receiving the event information the biometric information reading device control unit requests the image forming apparatus connecting unit of the biometric information reading device to obtain biometric information step S .

When requested the image forming apparatus connecting unit requests the biometric information obtaining to capture biometric information step S . The image forming apparatus connecting unit receives the captured biometric information from the biometric information obtaining and sends the captured biometric information to the biometric information reading device control unit of the image forming apparatus .

The biometric information reading device control unit sends a biometric authentication request including the captured biometric information to the login request unit step S .

Then the login request unit sends a login and biometric authentication request to the authentication processing unit of the service providing system step S . For example the login and biometric authentication request includes the captured biometric information and login information indicating for example a company code or a company ID for identifying a company to which the image forming apparatus belongs. The login information is read by the login request unit from the setting information storing unit see .

The authentication processing unit of the service providing system performs authentication a login process to the service providing system based on the login information received in step S step S . When the login process is successful authentication result is success the authentication processing unit searches the biometric authentication information stored in the user management information storing unit based on the captured biometric information and the login information company code or ID received in step S. More specifically the authentication processing unit searches the user management information storing unit to find biometric information matching the captured biometric information from sets or records of biometric information belonging to the company indicated by the company code or company ID step S . When matching biometric information is found the authentication processing unit outputs an authentication result success and user information corresponding to the found biometric information. Meanwhile when matching biometric information is not found the authentication processing unit outputs an authentication result failure . In the example of it is assumed that matching biometric information is found. The authentication processing unit also outputs an authentication result failure when the authentication in step S fails.

Thus in step S only records of users belonging to a company indicated by the company code or company ID are searched to find matching biometric information.

The authentication processing unit sends the authentication result and the user information when the authentication result is failure only the authentication result to the login request unit of the image forming apparatus .

The login request unit of the image forming apparatus registers the user information in the setting information storing unit step S . When the authentication result is success the login request unit allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S .

In the process of described above a company code or a company ID of a company to which the image forming apparatus belongs is sent in step S to the authentication processing unit to log into the service providing system . The company code corresponds to selected group information used in the process of . Also in the process of selected group information may be obtained and used instead of the group code.

In this case the user management information storing unit of the service providing system may contain group information as illustrated in user information as illustrated in and biometric authentication information as illustrated in for respective companies or organizations . Also in this case the login request unit may be configured to search the user management information storing unit based on a group code to find sets of group information associated with a company indicated by the group code and to display a group selection screen as illustrated in on the image forming apparatus based on the found sets of group information.

When the user selects a group on the displayed group selection screen selected group information indicating the selected group is saved. In step S of a login and biometric authentication request including the selected group information and captured biometric information is sent to the authentication processing unit . In step S the authentication processing unit searches the user management information storing unit to find biometric information matching the captured biometric information from sets of biometric information that belong to the selected group of the corresponding company. Other steps are substantially the same as those described with reference to .

Next a second exemplary biometric authentication process P in an authentication system employing a cloud service is described with reference to . Steps S S S and S of are substantially the same as the corresponding steps of . Also for brevity steps of corresponding to steps S S and S of are omitted.

After step S the authentication processing unit of the service providing system performs authentication login process based on a company code or a company ID in the login and biometric authentication request received from the image forming apparatus step S . When the login process is successful authentication result is success the authentication processing unit performs biometric authentication based on the company code and captured biometric information in the login and biometric authentication request and the biometric authentication information stored in the user management information storing unit step S . Then the authentication processing unit sends an authentication result success failure or confirmation to the image forming apparatus . When the authentication result is other than failure the authentication processing unit sends user information together with the authentication result.

Step S is similar to step S described with reference to B A and B. In step S however a company code or company ID is used instead of selected group information. Accordingly in step S the authentication processing unit searches records biometric information of the biometric authentication information stored in the user management information storing unit that are associated with the company code. Similarly to the process of the authentication processing unit also sends an authentication result failure to the image forming apparatus when the login process in step S fails.

When the authentication result from the authentication processing unit is success the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S . When the authentication result is failure the image forming apparatus prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus step S . When the authentication result is confirmation the image forming apparatus displays a user information input screen step S .

When the user information input screen is displayed in step S and the user inputs user information e.g. a user ID step S the image forming apparatus performs an additional authentication step. The image forming apparatus determines whether the entered user information is present in the user information sent together with the authentication result from the authentication processing unit of the service providing system step S . When the entered user information is present in the user information sent from the authentication processing unit the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S . Meanwhile when the entered user information is not present in the user information sent from the authentication processing unit the image forming apparatus prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus .

In the above described processes three types of authentication results success failure and confirmation are used. However the types or the number of authentication results are not limited to those described above. For example the authentication result may be set as success when the matching rate is greater than or equal to 95 and set as confirmation when the matching rate is less than 95 .

Also the second exemplary biometric authentication process P is not necessarily based on the first exemplary biometric authentication process P . For example the second exemplary biometric authentication process P may be performed based only on the captured biometric information received from the image forming apparatus without using the company code. In other words instead of comparing captured biometric information with sets of biometric information belonging to a company indicated by the company code the captured biometric information may be compared with all sets of biometric information stored in the user management information storing unit . In the second exemplary biometric authentication process P biometric authentication is combined with authentication based on input user information to improve the accuracy and efficiency of authentication.

In biometric authentication such as fingerprint authentication biometric information obtained from the same user may not be always the same. For example there may be a case where it becomes difficult to correctly capture a fingerprint of a user after the user performs a certain task. As a result the same user may be successfully authenticated at one occasion but not successfully authenticated at another occasion. Instead of determining success or failure based only on biometric authentication combining biometric authentication with another authentication method makes it possible to more flexibly and efficiently perform authentication.

Although biometric authentication and authentication based on input user information are combined in the second exemplary biometric authentication process P biometric authentication may be combined with any other authentication method such as authentication using a card. That is the above described approach may be applied to an authentication system where different authentication methods i.e. a first authentication method and a second authentication method are used in combination. In such an authentication system an authentication result of the first authentication method may be used when the authentication result is success and authentication based on the second authentication method may be performed when the authentication result is not success .

Also more than two authentication methods may be combined or a second authentication method may be selected from plural authentication methods based on the authentication result of the first authentication method. In this case conditions corresponding to respective authentication methods may be defined. For example when the matching rate of biometric authentication according to the first authentication method is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 85 confirmation may be performed based on a second authentication method. When the matching rate of biometric authentication according to the first authentication method is greater than or equal to 85 and less than 90 confirmation may be performed based on a third authentication method. When the matching rate of biometric information in the first authentication method is greater than or equal to 90 and less than 95 confirmation may be performed based on a fourth authentication method.

Next a first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P in an authentication system employing a cloud service is described with reference to B and . The first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P is similar to the first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to .

The functional configurations illustrated in are different from the functional configurations illustrated in in that a biometric authentication unit is added to the image forming apparatus . Other functional units of are substantially the same as those of . The biometric authentication unit may be implemented by executing a program installed in the image forming apparatus by the processor when the image forming apparatus has the hardware configuration of .

The process of is different from the process of in steps SA and SB. In the process of the authentication processing unit of the service providing system extracts users matching predetermined conditions step SA instead of performing biometric authentication step S of . Then the authentication processing unit sends user information of the extracted users to the image forming apparatus .

When receiving the user information from the authentication processing unit the biometric authentication unit of the image forming apparatus performs authentication step SB . Based on the result of authentication the biometric authentication unit allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S when the authentication result is success prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus step S when the authentication result is failure or displays a user information input screen step S when the authentication result is confirmation . Steps S through S are substantially the same as those of .

Other configurations and operations of the authentication system are substantially the same as those described with reference to and their descriptions are omitted here.

The predetermined conditions for extracting users are for example matching rate 95 and matching rate 90 . In this case users that match predetermined conditions are users with matching rates greater than or equal to 95 and users with matching rates greater than or equal to 90 . Also in this case the user information of the extracted users sent from the authentication processing unit to the image forming apparatus is for example matching rate 95 user A matching rate 90 users A and B .

When receiving the user information of the extracted users the biometric authentication unit of the image forming apparatus performs authentication according to the flowchart of or B and outputs an authentication result indicating success failure or confirmation . For example when user information matching rate 95 user A matching rate 90 users A and B is received the result of step S of becomes YES and the result of step S becomes two or more . Therefore in this case the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result confirmation . Meanwhile in the case of the result of step S becomes YES and the result of step S becomes one . In this case the biometric authentication unit outputs an authentication result success .

Preferably the predetermined conditions for extracting users may be set freely at the image forming apparatus .

According to the first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described above with reference to B and the image forming apparatus includes the biometric authentication unit that has a part of the biometric authentication function provided by the authentication processing unit in the configuration illustrated in . This configuration makes it possible to freely define at the image forming apparatus rules for determining an authentication result based on user information of the extracted users reported from the authentication processing unit . This in turn makes it possible to more flexibly define the rules for determining an authentication result.

A second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P in an authentication system employing a cloud service is described below with reference to . The second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P is similar to the second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to .

The authentication system AS of is different from the authentication system AS of in that an authentication server is added to the service providing system . The authentication server can communicate via the network NW with the access control apparatus the service providing apparatus and the service providing apparatus of the service providing system . Also similarly to the service providing apparatuses and the authentication server can communicate with the image forming apparatuses and the biometric information reading device via the network NW the access control apparatus the network NW the firewall and the network NW. Other configurations of the authentication system AS are substantially the same as those of the authentication system AS of .

The service providing system of is different from the service providing system of in that the authentication processing unit includes a function to report users matching predetermined conditions instead of the function to perform biometric authentication. Also an authentication application is added to the service applications . The authentication application is installed in the authentication server i.e. the authentication server provides the function of the authentication application . Other configurations of the service providing system of are substantially the same as those of the service providing system of .

The process of is different from the process of in steps SA through SE. Similarly to the process of instead of performing authentication step S of the authentication processing unit of the service providing system extracts users that match predetermined conditions step SA . However instead of sending user information of the extracted users to the image forming apparatus the authentication processing unit sends the user information to the authentication application of the service providing system . When receiving the user information from the authentication processing unit the authentication application performs authentication step SB which is performed by the image forming apparatus in the process of .

Based on the result of authentication in step SB the authentication application sends permission information to the image forming apparatus to allow the user to use the image forming apparatus step SC when the authentication result is success sends non permission information to the image forming apparatus to prevent the user from using the image forming apparatus step SD when the authentication result is failure or requests the image forming apparatus to display a user information input screen step SE when the authentication result is confirmation . In step SE the authentication application sends a user information input request including user information of the extracted users which is sent from the authentication processing unit in step SA to the image forming apparatus .

When receiving the permission information SC the non permission information SD or the user information input request SE the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S when the permission information is received prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus step S when the non permission information is received or displays a user information input screen step S when the user information input request is received .

When the user information input screen is displayed in step S and the user inputs user information e.g. a user ID step S the image forming apparatus performs an additional authentication step. The image forming apparatus determines whether the entered user information is present in the user information of the extracted users received in step SE from the authentication processing unit step S . When the entered user information is present in the user information of the extracted users the image forming apparatus allows the user to use the image forming apparatus step S . Meanwhile when the entered user information is not present in the user information of the extracted users the image forming apparatus prevents the user from using the image forming apparatus .

Other configurations and operations of the authentication system AS are substantially the same as those of the authentication system AS described with reference to and their descriptions are omitted here.

The second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to is different from the first variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to B and in that the functions of the biometric authentication unit of the image forming apparatus of are provided by the authentication server the authentication application . In the configuration of the authentication system AS the authentication server the authentication application is provided in the service providing system that is managed by an organization or a company that is different from an organization or a company to which the office including the image forming apparatus belongs.

Preferably the predetermined conditions for extracting users may be set freely at the authentication server the authentication application .

According to the second variation of the second exemplary biometric authentication process P described with reference to the authentication application performs a part of the biometric authentication function that is provided by the authentication processing unit in the configuration of . This configuration makes it possible to freely define at the authentication application rules for determining an authentication result based on user information of the extracted users reported from the authentication processing unit . This in turn makes it possible to more flexibly define the rules for determining an authentication result.

In an authentication system according to an embodiment a biometric authentication process as describe below is performed to authenticate the user of the image forming apparatus . The image forming apparatus sends selected group information indicating a group selected by the user or retained in the image forming apparatus and captured biometric information of the user obtained by the biometric information reading device to the biometric authentication server to request authentication of the user. The biometric authentication server limits the range of biometric information or users to be searched based on the selected group information and searches for the captured biometric information within the limited range of biometric information. This configuration makes it possible to more efficiently and quickly perform an authentication process.

In an authentication system according to another embodiment a biometric authentication process as describe below is performed to authenticate the user of the image forming apparatus . The image forming apparatus sends a retained company code or a company ID and captured biometric information of the user obtained by the biometric information reading device to the service providing system to request authentication of the user. The service providing system limits the range of biometric information or users to be searched based on the company code information and searches for the captured biometric information within the limited range of biometric information. This configuration makes it possible to more efficiently and quickly perform an authentication process.

Also when the matching rate is not high enough for success and not low enough for failure and or the number of matching users is greater than one the authentication result is set as confirmation . When the authentication result is confirmation the image forming apparatus requests the user to enter additional user information e.g. a user ID and compares the entered user information with user information received from the biometric authentication server to determine whether to allow the user to use the image forming apparatus . This configuration makes it possible to improve the accuracy of authentication.
