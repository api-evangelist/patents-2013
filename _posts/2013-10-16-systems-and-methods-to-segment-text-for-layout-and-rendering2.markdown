title: Systems and methods to segment text for layout and rendering
abstract: A method for segmenting text for layout on a web browser includes receiving a block of text at a client computer and defining a plurality of regular expressions, where a first regular expression in the plurality of regular expressions is used to search for a word or a word boundary. The client computer segments the block of text into a plurality of text segments, where the segmenting includes searching the block of text starting at a defined location for a first text segment that matches any of the plurality of regular expressions, adding the first text segment to the plurality of text segments, and updating the defined location to be located at the end of the first text segment within the block of text. The client computer then constructs a layout of the block of text using the plurality of text segments.

Internet services provide a variety of content and functionality to users on client computers. Web browsers executing on the client computers receive render and display content provided by web servers running the services. An example of an Internet service is a cloud computing service that allows users to create edit store and share files online. The files are stored on the cloud computing service rather than the client computers. The cloud computing service provides a user interface to the user s web browser for the display and editing of files. Files that may be stored on cloud computing services include word processing documents spreadsheets presentations audiovisual files and pictures.

Web browsers display text from content provided by web servers such as text in files stored on a cloud computing service. The web browser receives text and renders it for display on the display screen of the client computer. The web browser determines the layout of text on the screen for example determining the locations in the text where line breaks should be inserted based on the font style and size of the text the space allocated for the text the size of the browser window and other such constraints. The web browser processes text character by character to determine if a line break or other spacing may be inserted after such character. For example the web browser may determine that a letter character that is followed by another letter character cannot have a line break inserted after the first letter character while a letter character followed by a space character may have a line break inserted after the letter character. However processing text character by character to check for line break possibilities is a time consuming process especially for large blocks of text. This produces latency in displaying text from a web server on a client computer.

The systems and methods described herein provide ways to segment text into larger segments than characters before determining the layout of the text for example into words and word boundaries. A line break may be inserted between each text segment. Identifying words and word boundaries rather than processing the text a character at a time reduces the time necessary for constructing the layout of the text. The text is segmented using regular expressions. A regular expression is a programming language object constructed using a specific syntax that defines a pattern of characters. Regular expressions are used in many programming languages to search text for specific patterns of characters as defined by the regular expressions. For example regular expressions may be constructed for identifying words in text and for identifying word boundaries such as spaces tabs and breaks. Regular expressions are used to break a block of text into word segments and word boundary segments such that line breaks may be inserted between any two consecutive segments. This is more efficient than checking whether a line break may be inserted after each individual character of the text. The web browser on a client computer receives a block of text from a server. Starting from the beginning of the text regular expressions are used to search for the first occurring word or a word boundary. The word or word boundary is saved as a segment of text and the next word or word boundary is determined. The entire block is segmented in this fashion and the web browser uses the text segments to determine the layout of text on the screen of the client computer inserting line breaks between text segments as needed to wrap text to new lines. The segmenting process also takes into consideration locations of plug in objects within the text changes in text direction or style and special rules for certain Asian or other languages.

One aspect described herein discloses a method for segmenting text for layout on a web browser where the method includes receiving a block of text at a client computer and defining a plurality of regular expressions where a first regular expression in the plurality of regular expressions is used to search for a word or a word boundary. The method further includes segmenting the block of text into a plurality of text segments where the segmenting includes searching the block of text starting at a defined location for a first text segment that matches any of the plurality of regular expressions adding the first text segment to the plurality of text segments and updating the defined location to be located at the end of the first text segment within the block of text. The method further includes constructing a layout of the block of text using the plurality of text segments.

Another aspect described herein discloses an apparatus for segmenting text for layout on a web browser. The apparatus includes a client computer configured to receive a block of text and define a plurality of regular expressions where a first regular expression in the plurality of regular expressions is used to search for a word or a word boundary. The client computer is further configured to segment the block of text into a plurality of text segments where the segmenting includes searching the block of text starting at a defined location for a first text segment that matches any of the plurality of regular expressions adding the first text segment to the plurality of text segments and updating the defined location to be located at the end of the first text segment within the block of text. The client computer is further configured to construct a layout of the block of text using the plurality of text segments.

Another aspect described herein discloses a system for segmenting text for layout on a web browser where the system includes a plurality of client computers and a server configured to provide each of the plurality of client computers with a layout engine. The layout engine allows each client computer to perform a method that includes receiving a block of text from the server and defining a plurality of regular expressions where each of the plurality of regular expressions is used to search for a word or a word boundary. The method further includes segmenting the block of text into a plurality of text segments where the segmenting includes searching the block of text starting at a defined location for a first text segment that matches any of the plurality of regular expressions adding the first text segment to the plurality of text segments and updating the defined location to be located at the end of the first text segment within the block of text. The method further includes constructing a layout of the block of text using the plurality of text segments.

To provide an overall understanding of the systems and methods described herein certain illustrative embodiments will now be described. However it will be understood that the systems and methods described herein may be adapted and modified as is appropriate for the application being addressed and that the systems and methods described herein may be employed in other suitable applications and that such other additions and modifications will not depart from the scope thereof. In particular a server service or system as used in this description may be a single computing device or multiple computing devices working collectively and in which the storage of data and the execution of functions are spread out among the various computing devices.

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein relate to providing a way to segment text for layout on a web browser using regular expressions. The text is segmented into words or word boundaries using regular expressions such that line breaks may be inserted between any two consecutive text segments. This process is faster than checking whether a line break may be inserted after each character. The web browser on a client computer receives a block of text from a server. Starting from the beginning of the text regular expressions are used to search for the first occurring word or a word boundary. The word or word boundary is saved as a segment of text and the next word or word boundary is determined. The entire block is segmented in this fashion and the web browser uses the text segments to determine the layout of text on the screen of the client computer. The segmenting process also takes into consideration locations of plug in objects within the text changes in text direction or style and special rules for certain Asian or other languages.

First a network system in which a number of client computers may connect to a server is described. shows a network system that includes server and a number of client computers through . Server may include one or more computing devices that collectively provide online content and services for a number of client computers. One example of a service that may be provided by server is a cloud computing service that stores a number of files accessible by client computers . The files may include word processing documents spreadsheets presentations images audio files video files or any other files of various open or proprietary file types. Users may create edit copy share and delete files stored on the cloud computing service. Client computers may include desktop computers laptop computers tablets smart phones mobile electronic devices or any other device that may connect to server . System may include many additional client computers not pictured in . The network connection between the client computers and server in network system may be facilitated through a local area network wide area network Ethernet fiber optic network or any other wired or wireless connection.

The components of a client computer and a server in communication with each other are now described in more detail. System in includes a server in communication with a client computer . Server includes a central processing unit CPU read only memory ROM random access memory RAM communications unit data store and bus . Server may have additional components that are not illustrated in . Bus allows the various components of server to communicate with each other. Communications unit allows server to communicate with other devices such as client computer and other client computers. Data store is used to store content accessible by a user on client computer .

Client computer includes a CPU ROM RAM input output interface and bus . Client computer may have additional components that are not illustrated in . Bus allows the various components of client computer to communicate with each other. Input output interface allows client computer to communicate with other devices such as server . Input output interface also includes devices for taking in user inputs and displaying outputs to a user such as a keyboard mouse and display screen. CPU executes various programs stored in memory on client computer such as a web browser. Web browsers are used among other things to display content and services provided by server . Web browsers receive web page documents encoded in HTML CSS or other web compatible languages and interpret the language to properly display the web page.

Data store for storing content on server a web browser executing on client computer and other data structures and software programs in system may be implemented using non transitory computer readable media. Examples of suitable non transitory computer readable media include all forms of non volatile memory media and memory devices including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and read only once writable or rewriteable optical disks such as e.g. CD ROM CD R CD R CD RW CD RW DVD ROM DVD R DVD R DVD RW and DVD RW .

Servers may store text that is provided to users on client computers. For example a web server may store web pages that are displayed on web browsers executing on client computers. In another example a cloud computing service may store files that include text and provide web browsers with a user interface for displaying the content of the file. The user interface includes a layout and rendering engine that determines how the content of the file is displayed on the screen of the client computer. Thus the web browser is responsible for the layout and rendering of content including text. The layout of the text and the locations where text is wrapped to new lines depends on the font size and style space allocated for the text the size of the browser window and other such factors. While text may contain line breaks paragraph breaks and other formatting commands that force new lines of text much of the layout of the text is determined by the web browser.

The systems and methods described herein allow web browsers to use regular expressions to segment text into units that may include multiple characters. For example text may be segmented into words and word boundaries. Once segmented the web browser may insert line break locations between any two consecutive text segments when arranging the layout of the text on a display screen. This allows the web browser to complete the layout process faster than if the web browser processed the text character by character to identify possible line break locations. For example a block of text may contain 80 characters forming 12 words with a space between each word. Rather than inspecting all 80 characters to determine whether a line break may be inserted after each one the web browser identifies the 12 words and 11 spaces between each word as text segments where line breaks may be inserted between any two consecutive text segments. This reduces the amount of time needed by the web browser to configure the layout of the text. A regular expression is a programming language object constructed using a specific syntax that defines a pattern of characters. Regular expressions are used in many programming languages to search text for specific patterns of characters as defined by the regular expressions. Regular expressions may be constructed to find certain words in text for example all words that end in ing or begin with thr . Moreover regular expressions may be constructed to find all words in text and may also be constructed to find non word components in text such as spaces tabs breaks and other word boundaries. Regular expressions may also be used to find plug in objects occurring within text. Regular expressions are implemented in a variety of programming languages such as Java and C . Regular expressions are constructed using a special syntax which is discussed below. A web browser may use regular expressions to segment text into discrete word and non word segments. For layout purposes a line break may occur between any two consecutive text segments.

A server provides web browsers with a layout engine that performs text segmentation and layout functions for the content provided by the server. The layout engine is loaded into the cache of the web browser and is used by the web browser to lay out text provided by the server. The layout engine first creates a spacer array to store the text. shows a spacer array for text in . Spacer array is a table or matrix where cells of array store each character or non word component in the text. For example each letter in text is placed in a separate cell. Non word components are also stored in cells such as spaces represented as sp in tabs represented as tab and forced line breaks represented as lb . Each Chinese character is stored in a separate cell. Plug in object in is represented in spacer array by a special character shown as . The client computer stores a plug in registry which associates special characters with plug in objects. The special characters are used in the text as a placeholder for the plug in objects during the layout and rendering process. When the text is actually rendered the plug in objects are inserted at the locations of their corresponding special characters.

After the layout engine stores the text in a spacer array the layout engine segments the text into words. The layout engine starts at the beginning of the spacer array and searches the array using regular expressions that capture all words and word boundaries. For example the regular expressions that the layout engine searches for may include the following three regular expressions 

where u000c represents a page break u000b represents a line break t represents a tab and n represents a paragraph break. Regular expressions have specific syntax the indicates that the layout engine should search for zero or one of the preceding element the is an OR symbol the indicates that the layout engine should search for one or more of the preceding element square brackets indicates that the layout engine should match a single character contained within the brackets and indicates that the layout engine should match a single character that is not contained in the brackets. Thus the first regular expression shown above matches at least one space followed by zero or one page breaks. The second regular expression matches a series of consecutive elements that don t include a page break line break tab or paragraph break i.e. any word . The third regular expression matches a page break line break tab or paragraph break. The three regular expressions taken together captures all words and all word boundaries that include spaces page breaks paragraph breaks line breaks and tabs.

The layout engine may search a block of text using other regular expressions in addition to the ones discussed above. For example line break boundaries for Chinese Japanese and Korean languages the CJK languages may be defined using regular expressions. The character set model of the CJK languages may include a set of character classes that define characters after which a line may break. A regular expression is formulated to search for this set of character classes. Two more regular expressions are used to match characters that cannot be before a line break and characters that cannot be after a line break. Using these three regular expressions a segmentable word in CJK languages may be defined as 

where is regular expression syntax for matching zero or more of the preceding element. Thus a segmentable CJK word begins with zero or more characters that cannot precede a break includes one or more characters after which a break may occur and may end with zero or more characters that cannot follow a break.

The layout engine may also use regular expressions to search for special characters that represent plug in objects. A plug in registry associates plug in objects with special character values that are inserted into the text. The plug in registry may be stored on the server and sent to the client computer along with the layout engine. The layout engine may use regular expressions formulated to search for the special character values associated with plug in objects. The plug in object becomes a segmentable object such that line breaks may occur before or after the plug in object. For example in spacer array the character is a special character value that represents a plug in object. The text may be segmented before and after the character.

The layout engine starts that the beginning of spacer array and find the first set of elements that matches any one of the regular expressions discussed above. The set of elements is stored as a text segment and then the next consecutive text segment is identified using the regular expressions. The layout engine continues searching the text using the regular expressions until the spacer array has been completely segmented. For example the layout engine may have a getNextWord function that is defined as 

The layout engine may also segment text based on changes in the text direction. The text direction is stored at the character level for example as part of the metadata for that character. Thus regular expressions cannot be used to find locations where text changes. However the layout engine may scan the spacer array to determine the location of text direction changes. The locations of text direction changes are stored and consulted by the layout engine during the text segmentation process. If the text direction changes in the middle of an identified text segment the segment should be split at the location of the text direction change.

The layout engine may also segment text based on changes in the text style such as changes in the text font or size or changes in underlining italics bolding or other text formatting styles. The style of text is stored at the character level similar to the text direction and thus regular expressions cannot be used to find locations of text style changes. The layout engine may scan the spacer array to determine the location of text style changes. The locations of text style changes are stored and consulted by the layout engine during the text segmentation process. If the text style changes in the middle of an identified text segment the segment should be split at the location of the text style change.

Additional post processing steps may occur after the layout engine segments the text using the getNextWord function. For example if the text includes any Thai language then a separate application programming interface API on the web browser may be used to segment Thai characters into text segments. The Thai sentence structure follows different rules than English or the CJK languages so a separate process is used to segment Thai characters. Other languages may similarly also require post processing to properly segment the text.

The layout engine processes the entirety of the text into text segments where a line break may occur before or after each text segment but not in the middle of a segment. shows a text segment array constructed from spacer array in . Each word and word boundary becomes a text segment as well as the special character value representing the plug in object and the Chinese word for story. If any text direction changes or text style changes occur within the text the text could additionally be segmented at those locations. Also special language APIs may be used to further segment the text if those languages appear within the text. Text segment array may store the actual text as segments or may store pointers to the spacer array that define the start and end of each text segment. Text segment array may also store other information such as the text styles for each text segment and the size allocated for the block of text. After the text is fully segmented the layout engine uses text segment array to generate a layout for the text which is then rendered and displayed on the web browser. Each text segment is considered a unit and so the layout engine may insert line breaks before or after each text segment but not in the middle of a text segment. Thus the layout engine processes text by word rather than by character.

Methods for segmenting text for layout on a web browser using regular expressions are now described. shows a method for segmenting text for layout on a web browser. The method includes receiving a block of text at a client computer and defining a plurality of regular expressions where a first regular expression in the plurality of regular expressions is used to search for a word or a word boundary. The method further includes segmenting the block of text into a plurality of text segments where the segmenting includes searching the block of text starting at a defined location for a first text segment that matches any of the plurality of regular expressions adding the first text segment to the plurality of text segments and updating the defined location to be located at the end of the first text segment within the block of text. The method further includes constructing a layout of the block of text using the plurality of text segments. Method may be performed by a client computer such as client computer illustrated in .

Method begins when a client computer receives a block of text shown at . The client computer is in communication with a server that provides the block of text. For example the server may be a cloud computing service that provides the client computer with access to files stored on the cloud computing service. The server provides a user interface to a web browser executing on the client computer to display the contents of the file to the user. The user interface includes a layout engine for generating a layout of the file including the block of text for rendering. After the client computer receives the block of text it defines a plurality of regular expressions shown at . The regular expressions are used to search for words or word boundaries such as spaces tabs line breaks paragraph breaks or page breaks. A regular expression for a word may be defined as a series of text elements that does not include any word boundary. Regular expressions may also be used to search for Chinese Japanese or Korean words. Multiple regular expressions may be constructed for CJK words including words that cannot precede a line break words that cannot follow a line break and words that can precede or follow a line break. Regular expressions may also be used to search for character values that represent plug in objects. The text may include special character values that are placeholders for plug in objects and a plug in registry associates plug in objects with character values. The regular expression searches for these character values. The regular expressions may be defined by the server and sent to the client computer as part of the layout engine.

After the regular expressions have been defined the client computer segments the block of text shown as . The layout engine uses the regular expressions to segment the block of text into a plurality of text segments such that for layout purposes a line break may be inserted before or after each text segment. The block of text is stored in an array such as spacer array in . Starting at the beginning of the array the layout engine searches the block of text for a series of consecutive text elements that match any of the regular expressions shown as . For example the block of text may begin with the word The followed by a space. The word The matches a regular expression that is intended to match any word and so the word The becomes a text segment. Once a match has been found the text segment is stored in a text segment array shown at . An index or pointer is used to keep track of the location that the layout engine has most recently searched. After the text segment is stored the index is updated to point directly after the recently stored text segment in the spacer array shown at . The layout engine then starts from that location and searches the block of text for the next text segment that matches any of the regular expressions. The layout engine continues this process until the entire block of text is segmented. An example of the segmenting process is the getNextWord function discussed above.

The layout engine may also scan the block of text to identify locations where the text direction or text style changes. These changes cannot be captured by regular expressions but the layout engine may store the locations separately. When the layout engine is segmenting the text it also checks the locations of text direction or style changes and may further segment the text at these locations. For example if a text direction or style change occurs in the middle of a segmented word the word is segmented into two sub segments and stored in the text segment array instead of the whole word. In addition certain additional rules may apply for certain languages. Post processing routines and APIs may be used to segment the text further for those languages. After the text has been segmented the client computer constructs a layout of the block of text using the plurality of text segments shown as . The layout engine arranges the plurality of text segments for rendering and can insert line breaks between any two consecutive text segments. This allows the layout engine to lay out the text given constraints such as screen size web browser window size the amount of space allocated for text margins or font size and style. In this manner method provides a way to use regular expressions to segment text for layout on a web browser.
