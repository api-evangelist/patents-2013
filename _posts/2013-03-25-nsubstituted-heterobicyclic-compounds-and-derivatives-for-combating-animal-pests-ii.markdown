The present invention relates to N substituted hetero bicyclic compounds to the enantiomers diastereomers derivatives and salts thereof and to compositions comprising such compounds. The invention also relates to the use of the N substituted hetero bicyclic compounds of their salts or of compositions comprising them for combating animal pests. Furthermore the invention relates also to methods of applying such compounds.

Animal pests destroy growing and harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures causing large economic loss to the food supply and to property. While a large number of pesticidal agents are known due to the ability of target pests to develop resistance to said agents there is an ongoing need for new agents for combating animal pests. In particular animal pests such as insects and acaridae are difficult to be effectively controlled.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds having a good pesticidal activity especially against difficult to control insects and acaridae.

Compound of formula I according to the present invention can be prepared e.g. according the preparation methods and preparation schemes as described below.

Compounds of formula I according to the present invention can be prepared by standard methods of organic chemistry e.g. by the preparation methods and preparation schemes as described below. The definitions of n Het A B X R R R R W W Wand Wof the molecular structures given in the schemes are as defined above. Room temperature means a temperature range between about 20 and 25 C.

Two examples of general methods for the preparation of compounds of formula I are shown below in Scheme A. Thus construction of the bicyclic structural element present in compounds of formula I can be achieved for example by intramolecular alkylation of the exocyclic amino group of precursors of formula 1. Examples of suitable leaving groups LG in formula 1 include but are not limited to halogen alkyl sulfonate or haloalkyl sulfonate. This transformation is preferably carried out in polar solvents such as acetonitrile tetrahydrofuran or N N dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as a carbonate or tertiary amine base at temperatures ranging between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent. A second synthetic route to compounds of formula I is the intramolecular cyclization of precursors of formula 2. Suitable leaving groups LG include but are not limited to halogen O alkyl or S alkyl. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent such as toluene or xylene at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 160 C.

Compounds of formula Ia containing an unsaturated element within the bicyclic structural motif can also be prepared from precursors of formula 5 by ring closing metathesis Scheme B . To this end dienes of formula 5 are incubated with a metathesis catalyst such as for example the Grubbs ruthenium or Schrock molybdenum complex catalysts following procedures well known in the art see for example A. Gradillas et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2006 45 37 6086 6101 and references cited therein . Intermediates of formula 5 are accessible by incubation of amines of formula 3 with building blocks of formula 4. Suitable leaving groups LG in formula 4 include S alkyl O alkyl or halogen. Amines of formula 3 can be prepared by methods known in the art see for example S. Patai The Chemistry of the Amino Group Interscience Publishers New York 1968. The reaction of compounds 3 and 4 to give intermediate 5 is preferably carried out in a polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran acetonitrile or N N dimethylformamide in the presence of a tertiary amine or carbonate base such as triethyl amine or sodium carbonate respectively at temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. A representative procedure for this transformation in given in S. Chen et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007 17 8 2134 2138.

A general method for the preparation of compounds of formula Ib is the alkylation of bicycles of formula 7 with an electrophile of formula 6 Scheme C . Examples of the leaving group LG in formula 6 include halogen alkyl sulfonates or fluoroalkyl sulfonates. Preferably this transformation is carried out in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile acetone dichloromethane or N N dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as a carbonate a tertiary amine base or an alkali metal hydride such as triethyl amine sodium carbonate or sodium hydride respectively at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent.

Compounds of formula Ic featuring a structural element representing a subset of bicycles of formulae II 1 II 2 II 3 or II 4 wherein W Wand Wrepresent CRor N can be prepared by the synthetic sequence outlined in Scheme D. Thus bicycles of formula 10 can be prepared by N acylation or analogous reaction of a diamino substituted heterocycle e.g. pyridine pyridazine pyrimidine pyrazine or triazine of formula 8 with a reagent of formula 9 followed by cyclo condensation. Alkylation of bicycles of formula 10 with an electrophile of formula 6 gives rise to compounds of formula Ic . Examples of the leaving group LG in formula 9 and 6 include halogen alkyl sulfonates or fluoroalkyl sulfonates. Preferably both transformation is carried out in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile acetone dichloromethane or N N dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as a carbonate a tertiary amine base or an alkali metal hydride such as triethyl amine sodium carbonate or sodium hydride respectively at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent. For a representative example for the N acylation cyclo condensation reaction see WO2010135568.

Intermediates of formula 12 can be converted to their S oxidized analogs sulfoxides sulfones of formula Ig . Suitable oxidants include for example meta chloroperbenzoic acid hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite. Depending on the nature of the sulfur substituent R intermediates of formula Id wherein X represents halogen alkoxy alkylthio NHor CN can be converted to products of formula Ic with a nucleophile HX. Preferably this transformation is carried out in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile dichloromethane tetrahydrofurane or N N dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as a carbonate a tertiary amine base or an alkali metal hydride such as triethyl amine sodium carbonate or sodium hydride respectively at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent.
