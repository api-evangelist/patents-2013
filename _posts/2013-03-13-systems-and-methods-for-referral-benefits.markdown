Referring now to a block diagram of a system according to some embodiments is shown. In some embodiments the system may comprise one or more original and or referring players e.g. player 101 e.g. a Sugar Daddy and or Parent one or more first tier referral players e.g. players 201 and 202 e.g. Sugar Buddies and or Children one or more second tier referral players e.g. players 301 302 and 303 e.g. Sugar Buddies and or Grandchildren and or one or more third tier referral players e.g. players 401 and 402 e.g. Sugar Buddies and or Great Grandchildren . In some embodiments any or all of the players may be associated with one or more game rooms e.g. game sessions game instances game types game rooms etc. .

According to some embodiments any or all of the components of the system may be similar in configuration and or functionality to any similarly named and or numbered components described herein. Fewer or more components and or portions thereof and or various configurations of the components may be included in the system without deviating from the scope of embodiments described herein. Any component depicted in the system may comprise a single object a combination of objects and or components and or a plurality of objects as is or becomes desirable and or practicable. Similarly in some embodiments one or more of the various components may not be needed and or desired in the system .

In some embodiments the various players may be related via player referrals. The original or Parent player for example may have invited and or referred each of the first tier players or Children to an online gaming system e.g. the system . Typical referral systems may provide a bonus and or other incentive to the Parent player for having referred the Children players e.g. upon the Children players establishing accounts with the system . In some embodiments the player 202 of the Children players may have similarly referred and or invited each of the second tier or Grandchildren players . In typical systems the player 202 of the Children players may be rewarded for having referred the Grandchildren players . According to some embodiments the player 302 of the Grandchildren players may have invited and or referred the Great Grandchildren players . The referral and or other such as a friend and or social networking relationships between the players depicted in are provided for non limiting exemplary purposes and for illustration and ease of description only. Fewer or more referral relationships may be possible and or desirable in accordance with some embodiments.

According to some embodiments the players may have access to login to register for enter join and or play an online game e.g. an online multiplayer game such as bingo via one or more of the game rooms . In some embodiments a first game room may host a first game e.g. Bingo Game 1 a second game room may host a second game e.g. Bingo Game 2 and or a third game room may host a third game e.g. Bingo Game 3 . As depicted in each game room may list the players currently logged in registered for joined and or playing in the respective game. As utilized herein the term game room may generally refer to any grouping segmentation categorization listing and or other virtual and or actual association between one or more players and a particular game game type and or game session. As is typical in many online games for example players may join a particular server hosting a particular game and or may enter and or join a particular room e.g. a virtual and or graphical representation of a particular grouping of players via which a game may be played. In many cases such rooms comprise lobbies or areas where players may virtually congregate between sessions of a game hosted by and or via the room and or otherwise when not playing e.g. prior to joining an actual session of the game play and or after having joined e.g. after elimination . According to some embodiments the game rooms may comprise online virtual game rooms in which different sessions of the respective games are hosted and or managed.

In some embodiments the referral relationships between the various players may be identified and or determined with respect to one or more of the game rooms . With respect to the first game room for example it may be determined that the Parent player player 201 of the Children players and player 302 of the Grandchildren players have each joined registered for entered and or are otherwise associated with the first game room . In some embodiments it may be determined that each of players 101 201 and 302 are playing have played and or are likely to imminently play in a game session hosted by and or via the first game room . According to some embodiments one or more of the players 101 201 and 302 in the first game room may be rewarded based on the referral and or other type of relationship between the players 101 201 and 302 and based on their joining and or playing in the first game room e.g. the same game room and or game session .

According to some embodiments for example any or all of the players 101 201 and 302 may be awarded monetary value e.g. credits currency virtual or real points miles and or may be awarded a feature characteristic power advantage bonus and or other benefit in the first game room in the respective Bingo Game 1 and or in a particular session of the game. In some embodiments the rewarding may be conducted upon a determination that i the players 101 201 and 302 are all in the first game room and or ii the players 101 201 and 302 are all actively playing or have completed playing in via the first game room . For example the Parent player may receive a bonus of a first magnitude for having managed to have successfully referred both of player 201 and player 302 and for having managed to join the same game room the first game room and or game session as the referred player 201 and player 302.

In some embodiments either or both of player 201 and player 302 may also or alternatively receive bonuses such as of a second magnitude different than the first magnitude e.g. lower for having managed to join the same game room the first game room and or game session as the Parent player . In some embodiments such referral bonuses may only be provided to one or more of the players 101 201 and 302 in the case that one or more of such players 101 201 and 302 achieves a winning condition in a game session conducted via the first game room . In the case of the example Bingo Game 1 for example in the case that the Parent player wins a bingo match conducted via the first game room the Parent player may be awarded not only the allotted prize for achieving the win but may also receive a bonus and or other benefit due to the presence of the player 201 and or player 302 in the same room and or session.

As another example it may be determined that each of player 202 of the Children players and player 301 and player 303 of the Grandchildren players are associated with the second game room . It may be determined for example that a particular game session is being conducted in and or via the second game room and that the players 202 301 and 303 are currently competing in the game session adversarially or cooperatively . In some embodiments a referral and or friend reward may be provided in response to such a determination upon completion of the determination and or upon one of the players 202 301 and 303 winning the game session in the second game room . In some embodiments the magnitude of the reward may be based upon the magnitude of related players in the same session room. In the example of the second game room for example player 202 may receive a larger benefit e.g. a double and or additive bonus due to two 2 Grandchildren players being in the same session room as the player 202 and having been referred invited and or friended by the player 202 .

In some embodiments rewards for playing with and or being in the same game room with related players e.g. related by referrals friend status and or otherwise may be based upon and or take into account other factors. In the example of the third game room for example the Great Grandchildren players may receive a special reward and or bonus for having managed to join the entire Great Grandchild generation i.e. all of the Great Grandchildren players in the same session room. Such a bonus may differ in magnitude from other related player bonuses such as those described with respect to the first game room and or the second game room such as by being larger . In some embodiments rewards may be based on player participation in the third game room and or one or more of the game sessions thereof outside of the relationships of the referral players . As indicated by the dotted arrow pointing to player 403 for example one or more of the players 401 402 and 403 may receive a reward for playing together even though player 403 is not a member of the same referral friend tree. Rewards may be based for example on playing with other players having certain pre defined characteristics and or other criteria known or unknown to the players . The system may reward players having consecutive player identifiers e.g. players 401 402 and 403 that play together for example and or may reward players of a certain geographic demographic and or other class type and or categorization.

According to some embodiments a relationship between the original player and one or more of the referral players may be associated e.g. cause and or trigger with an awarding of a benefit reward and or prize based on a magnitude of interaction of the one or more of the referral players with the system and or an associated entity . An online gaming wagering and or other entity and or company may for example allow and or provide login credentials and or player or other type accounts that may be utilized to play games place wagers make purchases win prizes e.g. jackpots etc. In some embodiments a first reward and or benefit may be provided to the original player in the case that a referral player i.e. someone that the original player has referred to the entity company website game and or system consummates a first action. In some embodiments one or more second rewards benefits may be provided in the case that the referral player consummates a second action. A first monetary amount or other award e.g. a game feature and or attribute may be provided to the original player in the case that the referral player visits a website for example and or a second monetary amount other award may be provided in the case that the referral player creates a player and or other type of account at with the website logs into such an account places a wager utilizing the account wins a game utilizing the account etc. In some embodiments such tiered benefits may be mutually exclusive e.g. a second and or subsequent reward replaces the first reward. According to some embodiments such benefits may be at least partially cumulative.

Turning to a block diagram of a system according to some embodiments is shown. In some embodiments the system may comprise a plurality of online games each gaming defining and or comprising various attributes. In the case of an online wagering and or multiplayer game such as bingo as depicted the games may define and or comprise wager amounts progressive win amounts group RAF bonuses and or win amounts 

According to some embodiments any or all of the components of the system may be similar in configuration and or functionality to any similarly named and or numbered components described herein. Fewer or more components and or portions thereof and or various configurations of the components may be included in the system without deviating from the scope of embodiments described herein. Any component depicted in the system may comprise a single object a combination of objects and or components and or a plurality of objects as is or becomes desirable and or practicable. Similarly in some embodiments one or more of the various components may not be needed and or desired in the system .

In some embodiments the system may illustrate how player and or group referrals and or other relationships affect implementation of online games . A first online game e.g. Bingo Game 1 as depicted and or game session or room may for example be configured to require and or accept a first wager amount of one hundred 100 units e.g. credits dollars points and or other indicators of monetary pseudo monetary and or non monetary value may provide a first progressive win amount of ten percent 10 of the first wager amount i.e. ten 10 units and or may provide a first win amount of sixty five 65 units. In the example of the first game may illustrate an example of a typical progressive online game configuration. The first game may as depicted for example not include and or offer any first group RAF bonuses

In some embodiments a second online game and or game session or room may also or alternatively illustrate an example of a typical standard and or non progressive online game configuration. The second game may for example be configured to require and or accept a second wager of one hundred 100 units e.g. credits dollars points and or other indicators of monetary pseudo monetary and or non monetary value may not provide any second progressive win amount and or may provide the second progressive win amount as zero percent 0 of the second wager amount i.e. zero 0 units and or may provide a second win amount of eighty 80 units. In the example of the second game may not include and or offer any second group RAF bonuses

According to some embodiments a third game and or game session or room may be configured to require and or accept a third wager amount of one hundred 100 units e.g. credits dollars points and or other indicators of monetary pseudo monetary and or non monetary value may not provide any third progressive win amount and or may provide the third progressive win amount as zero percent 0 of the third wager amount i.e. zero 0 units and or may provide a third win amount of seventy 70 units. In the example of the third game third group RAF bonuses are provided. As depicted for example a typical player of the third game e.g. a non buddy may be awarded a first bonus amount of a first magnitude e.g. zero percent 0 or zero 0 units a player having joined as a result of a referral and or otherwise having a pre defined relationship and or a relationship of a relatively lower hierarchical rank with respect to another related player a buddy may be awarded a second bonus amount of a second magnitude e.g. ten percent 10 or ten 10 units and or a player having referred others and or otherwise having a pre defined relationship and or a relationship of a relatively higher hierarchical rank with respect to another related player a daddy may be awarded various bonus amounts based on a number of buddies playing in the same session room game e.g. the third game as the daddy . The daddy may be awarded for example i a third bonus amount of a third magnitude e.g. one hundred percent 100 or one hundred 100 units in the case that three 3 buddies play with the daddy ii a fourth bonus amount of a fourth magnitude e.g. fifty percent 50 or fifty 50 units in the case that two 2 buddies play with the daddy iii a fifth bonus amount of a fifth magnitude e.g. twenty five percent 25 or twenty five 25 units in the case that one 1 buddy plays with the daddy and or iv a sixth bonus amount of a sixth magnitude e.g. zero percent 0 or zero 0 units in the case that zero 0 buddies play with the daddy .

The various magnitudes depicted for the bonus amounts are provided as non limiting examples. Other magnitudes hierarchical relationships schemes and or configurations of the bonus amounts may be provided in some embodiments. In some embodiments fewer or more bonus amounts may be provided. In some embodiments the bonus amounts may be awarded upon the occurrence of various triggering conditions and or the satisfaction of one or more pre stored rules and or criteria. The second bonus amount may awarded to a player having been referred to the third game for example upon the buddy logging into joining registering for and or initiating play of a game session of the third game and or the second bonus amount may be provided to the buddy in the case that the buddy earns and or obtains the third win amount . In some embodiments the bonus amounts may be based on the number of players of the third game the number of related referral players and or types thereof in the third game e.g. as depicted by the third fourth and fifth bonus amounts the third wager amount and or the third win amount e.g. a multiplier thereof .

According to some embodiments implementation of a referral bonus feature may cause an alteration and or setting of various game parameters. While a typical non progressive game such as the second game may be configured to provide the second win amount of eighty 80 units for example a group RAF version of the second game e.g. the third game may be altered and or configured to provide instead the third win amount of seventy 70 units. The ten 10 unit difference may for example be implemented to account for the possibility that group RAF players i.e. daddies and buddies may earn and or achieve one or more of the third group RAF bonuses . Similarly a typical progressive game such as the first game in some embodiments may be altered and or configured to provide the third win amount instead of the first win amount and or the first progressive win amount may be modified to become the third progressive win amount and or the first group RAF bonus amounts may be altered to becomes the third group RAF bonus amounts .

In some embodiments the first game and or the second game may be actively altered and or reconfigured to define the third game . The first game may be configured as depicted in for example but may be reconfigured as depicted by the path A upon an occurrence of one or more triggering events. In the case that the first game is populated by a plurality of group RAF players for example the third group RAF bonuses may be implemented e.g. to reward player referrals and or coordinated playing the third progressive win amount may be implemented e.g. effectively removing the progressive feature from the game and or the third win amount may be implemented e.g. actually increasing the standard win for a game session . In accordance with such an embodiment the first game may be transformed and or converted into the third game . This may occur in a variety of manners such as by switching players of the first game from a first game room not separately depicted to a third game room also not separately depicted or by modifying the game parameters within a single game room.

Similarly the second game may be configured as depicted in for example but may be reconfigured as depicted by the path B upon an occurrence of one or more triggering events. Upon a win by a group RAF player in the second game for example the game parameters may be altered to achieve the third game e.g. within the same game room server . In some embodiments reconfiguration may occur between game sessions. A first game session of the second game may be conducted for example in which a plurality of group RAF players have joined and or played. Based on their presence generally or specifically such as based on the number and or configuration of such players in the second game the second game may be converted to the third game for the next subsequent game session. In such a manner for example the makeup of players in a given game and or game room may affect the game parameters implemented in subsequent sessions of the same game and or games in the same room or on the same server. In some embodiments the presence of certain payers having per defined relationships e.g. referrals friends adversaries stat based groupings in a first game session may cause a subsequent game session to be reconfigured. In the example of for example the win amounts may be adjusted and or the group RAF bonuses may be implemented.

According to some embodiments the games may comprise multiplayer online games such as the depicted bingo poker sports simulation games strategy games first person shooter games role playing games etc. In some embodiments the games may comprise wagering games games of chance games of skill and or hybrids thereof. In some embodiments the win amounts may comprise and or define benefits conferred upon a limited set of players in a single session of the games . A single session of the second game may for example involve a plurality of players not shown in playing adversarially and or cooperatively to obtain the second win amount . In some embodiments the second win amount may be provided to a single winner in skill chance and or both of the session of the second game or may be provided to a subset of the top ranked players at the end of game play each such player may receive the second win amount for example or the second win amount may be split amongst such players evenly randomly and or in a pro rata or other distribution fashion .

Turning to a flow diagram of a method according to some embodiments is shown. In some embodiments the method may be performed and or implemented by and or otherwise associated with one or more specialized and or computerized processing devices e.g. the player and or user devices and or the servers and or controller devices of and or herein specialized computers computer terminals computer servers computer systems and or networks and or any combinations thereof e.g. by one or more online gaming company and or online gaming player processing devices . In some embodiments the method may be embodied in facilitated by and or otherwise associated with various input mechanisms and or interfaces such as the interfaces of and or herein.

The process and or flow diagrams described herein do not necessarily imply a fixed order to any depicted actions steps and or procedures and embodiments may generally be performed in any order that is practicable unless otherwise and specifically noted. Any of the processes and or methods described herein may be performed and or facilitated by hardware software including microcode firmware or any combination thereof. For example a storage medium e.g. a hard disk Universal Serial Bus USB mass storage device and or Digital Video Disk DVD may store thereon instructions that when executed by a machine such as a computerized processing device result in performance according to any one or more of the embodiments described herein.

In some embodiments the method may comprise determining a relationship between players at . An electronic and or computerized processing device and or controller device may for example identify lookup derive and or otherwise determine that two or more players are related. In some embodiments the players may be related by nature of a first one of the players having referred a second one of the players to an online gaming system. In some embodiments players may be related by nature of a stored indication that the players are friends e.g. within an online gaming system account system and or within and or via one or more social media systems and or accounts such as Facebook Twitter etc. In some embodiments the relationship may be determined by receiving one or more indications from one or more of the players. A first and or referring player may invite the other player s to the system and or to a specific game room and or session via an interface provided by the system for example such that the system is privy to an identifier of the invited player as well as an identifier of the inviting referring player . In the case that the invited player responds e.g. directly to the invite such as by clicking on a hyperlink and or indirectly the system may utilize identifying information of the responding player to determine that the invited player is related to the inviting player.

In some embodiments the inviting and or referred player may provide a code and or other identifier to the system e.g. upon registration and or otherwise. The system may utilize the code and or identifier to identify the referring inviting player and accordingly define and or establish a relationship there between. In some embodiments third party systems and or websites or devices may be queried and or accessed to determine a relationship between players. The system may for example search a third party account system e.g. Facebook to determine which registered online game players are related via such a third party system. In some embodiments players may then be contacted and or prompted to carry over such third party relationships into the gaming account system. In some embodiments such third party relationships may be determined by receiving a query and or prompt from and or via such a third party system. A player may utilize a third party account system to request and or notify the gaming system of a third party relationship between players for example.

According to some embodiments the method may comprise determining that the players are in the same game session at . With respect to a game such as an online game a multiplayer game a wagering game a skill game and or any combinations thereof for example it may be determined that the related players are logged into have joined are registered for and or are playing in a particular game session e.g. an instance of a game game room and or on a particular game server. Player identifiers for players in a particular game session and or room may be cross references and or checked for example to determine that two or more of the players are related. In some embodiments the nature of the relationship may be determined. It may be determined for example that the players are related as a referring player e.g. a Sugar Daddy and a referred player e.g. a Sugar Buddy as social networking friends and or family and or as players selected by the system as being related e.g. to incent such players to play together . According to some embodiments such as in the case that more than two 2 related players are determined to be in the same session room it may be determined how many related players and or related players of certain tiers and or classes are in the same session room e.g. it may be determined that a single Sugar Daddy and two 2 Sugar Buddies are playing the same game session .

In some embodiments the method may comprise determining a win by one of the players at . The gaming system may for example determine that one or more conditions required for achieving a win condition due to skill and or chance have been satisfied with respect to one or more players e.g. as part of an execution of a game program and or procedure . In some embodiments the win may comprise an ultimate and or concluding win for a game session. Such a win may be earned solely by a single winning player and or team or may be distributed in some fashion amongst a subset of the highest ranking and or top rated players having finished and or completed the game session. In some embodiments the win may comprise an intermediate non final and or non conclusory and or other win and or winning event and or outcome. The win may comprise for example an achievement earned and or obtained via game play in the game session such as a rate of play number of kills team cooperative play points and or other team based metrics etc. In some embodiments it may be determined that two 2 or more related players e.g. two or more referral related players have achieved a winning condition.

According to some embodiments the method may comprise rewarding the winning player based on the presence of the related player in the same game session at . In some embodiments the rewarding may be conducted in response to the determining of the win by the one of the players at . The winning player for example may be awarded a prize based on a successful completion of the game session and or may receive an additional prize and or consideration based on the presence of the related player s in the session that has been won. In some embodiments a single prize may be awarded but may be selected e.g. from a pool of available prizes and or defined e.g. in terms of magnitude and or type based on the presence of the related player s in the same game session as the winning player. In some embodiments such as in the case that the win comprises an intermediate win and or an in game achievement e.g. as opposed to a conclusory and or game session ending win an in game bonus feature capability and or item may be selected and or provided based on the achievement occurring in the presence of the related player s .

In some embodiments the rewarding may be conducted in response to the determining that the players are in the same game session at . One or more of the related players may be rewarded even in the absence of a win for example such as upon initiating play of the same game session entering the same game room and or performing some joint action in the game session. According to some embodiments the rewarding may be based on a number and or type of related players in the same game session and or room and or a number of related players that achieve one or more win conditions in the game session room . A winning player having played with zero 0 related players in the same session may receive a default and or standard prize for example while in the case that one 1 related player was present for the win and or during at least a portion of the game play of the session a higher magnitude and or different prize may be awarded and or in the case that three 3 related players were present to witness the win an even higher magnitude prize and or different prize and or prize type may be provided to the winning player. In some embodiments certain numbers and or combinations of relationship types may be promoted by enhancing awards for players playing in game sessions and or winning such game sessions where such combinations occur.

In some embodiments the rewarding may occur after an initial game session in which it is determined e.g. at that the related players are present. Player lists from a first game session may influence and or dictate or define game parameters e.g. win amounts bonus amounts and or progressive settings for subsequent game sessions for example. In some embodiments such game parameter changes may take place in a given game room server and or for a particular game type class and or tournament and be applied to subsequent tournaments. In some embodiments such changes may be effectuated regardless of whether the player list stays the same. The subsequent game session may for example have a different player composition e.g. may not include the related players and or the same related players yet may nevertheless be altered based on the player composition from the previous session.

Turning now to and example user interfaces according to some embodiments are shown. In some embodiments the user interfaces may comprise one or more web pages web forms web browser plug ins and or add ins database entry forms API tools spreadsheets tables and or applications or other GUI tools via which a user may participate in conduct and or manage one or more online games.
