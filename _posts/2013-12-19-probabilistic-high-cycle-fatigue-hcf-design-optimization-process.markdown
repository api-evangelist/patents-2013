The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to contract number FA8650 09 D 2923 DO 0011 between the United States Air Force and United Technologies Corporation.

The present disclosure relates generally to gas turbine engines and more particularly to systems and methods for assessing risk of high cycle fatigue in a gas turbine engine.

Gas turbine engines typically include a compressor a combustor and a turbine with an annular flow path extending axially through each. Initially air flows through the compressor where it is compressed or pressurized. The combustor then mixes and ignites the compressed air with fuel generating hot combustion gases. These hot combustion gases are then directed from the combustor to the turbine where power is extracted from the hot gases by causing blades of the turbine to rotate.

Various components of the gas turbine engine such as fan compressor and turbine airfoils are subject to high tensile and vibratory stress fields due to the high rotational speeds of the gas turbine engine rotors. Airfoil damage such as cracking or failure may result from high cycle fatigue HCF caused by the induced vibratory stress cycles. In addition modern engine design trends have incorporated higher rotor speeds higher stage pressure ratios and reduced axial spacing factors which all increase the strength of the disturbances exciting the engine components. Therefore it is necessary to address HCF risk during design and validation of the various engine components.

Currently design and validation practices to mitigate HCF risk are predominantly deterministic single point assessments that do not explicitly capture the inherent blade to blade and engine to engine variability in HCF behavior. Accordingly there exists a need for HCF design analysis and validation techniques that recognize the inherent variability in manufactured components and usage of gas turbine engines.

According to one embodiment of the present disclosure a method for analyzing high cycle fatigue HCF in a design of a gas turbine engine is disclosed. The method may comprise identifying a component of the gas turbine engine for high cycle fatigue analysis inputting parametric data of the component over a predetermined parameter space into at least one computer processor using the at least one computer processor to build a plurality of flexible models of the component based on the parametric data of the component over the predetermined parameter space using the at least one computer processor to build a plurality of emulators of the component based on the plurality of flexible models and using the at least one computer processor to predict a probability of HCF based at least in part on the parametric data of the component over the predetermined parameter space and the plurality of emulators.

In a refinement the method may further comprise using the at least one computer processor to assess a response due to mistuning and damping.

In a related refinement the method may further comprise using the at least one computer processor to combine the response due to mistuning and damping on the component with the plurality of emulators and to predict the probability of HCF based at least in part on the response due to mistuning and damping.

In another refinement the method may further comprise using the at least one computer processor to display the probability of HCF over the predetermined parameter space in a histogram.

In yet another refinement the method may further comprise analyzing which parametric data most contributes to the probability of HCF.

According to another embodiment of the present disclosure a method for assessing a risk of high cycle fatigue in a gas turbine engine having an array of airfoils is disclosed. The method may comprise determining parametric data for an airfoil generating at least one flexible model based on the parametric data for the airfoil generating at least one emulator based on the at least one flexible model determining a damped mistuned response of the airfoil in the gas turbine engine and generating a distribution of stresses on the airfoil based at least in part on the parametric data the at least one emulator and the damped mistuned response.

In a refinement the method may further comprise determining parametric data including internal and external airfoil geometry material properties crystallographic orientation fatigue capability loading properties axial gapping airfoil angles thermal characteristics heat transfer coefficients cooling hole diameters and film thicknesses.

In another refinement the method may further comprise using at least one of a computer aided design tool and a finite element mesh morphing tool to generate the at least one flexible model.

In another refinement the method may further comprise using at least one of principal component analysis proper orthogonal decomposition Gaussian stochastic processes response surface techniques computer software and Bayesian calibration methods to generate the at least one emulator.

In another refinement the method may further comprise using a frequency based mistuning assessment tool and a damping assessment tool to determine the damped mistuned response of the airfoil.

In another refinement the method may further comprise combining the damped mistuned response of the airfoil with the at least one emulator to generate the distribution of stresses on the airfoil.

In another refinement the method may further comprise analyzing the distribution of stresses on the airfoil in relation to the parametric data for the airfoil and identifying the parametric data that most contributes to the distribution of stresses.

In a related refinement the method may further comprise changing the parametric data to generate a narrow distribution of stresses.

According to yet another embodiment of the present disclosure a system for optimizing a design of an airfoil of a gas turbine engine is disclosed. The system may comprise a computer processor an input output device receiving parametric data related to the design of the airfoil a flexible model generated by the computer processor based on the parametric data and an emulator generated by the computer processor to simulate the flexible model wherein the computer processor determines a damped mistuned response of the airfoil during operation of the gas turbine engine and generates a distribution of frequencies mode shapes and vibratory stress levels of the airfoil using the emulator and the damped mistuned response of the airfoil.

In a refinement the parametric data may include at least one of internal and external airfoil geometry material properties crystallographic orientation fatigue capability loading properties axial gapping airfoil angles thermal characteristics heat transfer coefficients cooling hole diameters and film thicknesses.

In another refinement the computer processor may be operatively configured to receive changes to the set of parametric data.

In another refinement the flexible model may be configured to support structural and thermal sensitivity analysis.

In another refinement the emulator may be a surrogate model based on mathematical analysis techniques.

In another refinement the computer processor may be operatively configured to combine the damped mistuned response of the airfoil with the emulator to generate the distribution of frequencies mode shapes and vibratory stress levels on the airfoil.

In yet another refinement the computer processor may be operatively configured to utilize at least one of existing data laser holography strain gages non interference stress measurement system data experimental data and bench spin and engine test data to validate the distribution of frequencies mode shapes and vibratory stress levels on the airfoil.

These and other aspects and features of the disclosure will become more readily apparent upon reading the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Although various features are disclosed in relation to specific exemplary embodiments of the invention it is understood that the various features may be combined with each other or used alone with any of the various exemplary embodiments of the invention without departing from the scope of the invention.

While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions certain illustrative embodiments thereof will be shown and described below in detail. It should be understood however that there is no intention to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications alternative constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to the drawings and with specific reference to in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure an exemplary gas turbine engine is shown. The gas turbine engine may generally comprise a compressor section where air is pressurized a combustor downstream of the compressor section which mixes and ignites the compressed air with fuel and thereby generates hot combustion gases a turbine section downstream of the combustor for extracting power from the hot combustion gases and an annular flow path extending axially through each. Gas turbine engine may be used on an aircraft for generating thrust or power or in land based operations for generating power as well.

Turning now to a system and method respectively for assessing high cycle fatigue HCF risk in a design of the gas turbine engine is shown according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. The system may implement at least part of method and may comprise an input output device and any non transitory computer readable storage medium such as at least one computer processor as shown best in .

At a first step in the method of a component for HCF analysis is identified. The method may be applied to any component of the gas turbine engine . For example the method may be applied to an airfoil or array of airfoils shown in . The array of airfoils may comprise a stage of rotor blades or stator vanes in the compressor section or turbine section of the gas turbine engine . Of course the HCF method and system of the present disclosure can be used to analyze any number of other gas turbine engine components with the airfoil being but one example.

At a next step parametric data for the component is determined. Parametric data may include any data related to the variability of the component from manufacture. Distributions for each of the relevant input parameters may be collected. As shown in exemplary airfoil manufacturing data may include but not be limited to parameter variations related to geometry material properties and thermal parameters such as internal airfoil geometry external airfoil geometry modulus crystallographic orientation and average cooling mass flow . Other parametric data may also include but not be limited to unsteady forcing or loading characteristics axial gapping blade vane stagger angles fatigue capability heat transfer coefficients and cooling hole diameters. A white light airfoil scan computed tomography scan and or other means may be used to determine the parametric data.

After the parametric data is obtained at a next step at least one flexible model of the identified component may be generated from the data. Based on the parametric data multiple flexible models may be generated to support structural and thermal analysis. For example the parametric data may be input into a computer aided design tool and or a finite element mesh morphing tool in order to build the at least one flexible model. When the input data is changed the flexible modeling tools can change the model accordingly and the process may be iterated to create multiple models. Model validation of the at least one flexible model may also require individual airfoil frequency data information related to frequency and mode shape determined from the parametric data or other input data as shown in .

Next at a step at least one reduced order model or emulator may be generated from the at least one flexible model. The emulators may act as surrogates for the multiple flexible models in order to enable computationally efficient analysis across the design manufacturing and anticipated usage space. For example the emulators may be used to quickly run simulations identify patterns in the highly dimensional parametric data set capture geometric variation and characterize dynamic behavior of the manufactured airfoils and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the variations in frequency modeshape and modal work with other analyses being possible as well. Reduced order modeling approaches to create the emulators may include but not be limited to the use of mathematical analysis techniques principal component analysis proper orthogonal decomposition Gaussian stochastic processes response surface techniques and Bayesian calibration methods.

At a step a damped mistuned response of the identified component may be determined. For example underplatform dampers may be used in airfoils to mitigate HCF. In addition mistuning may occur in a stage of airfoils during engine operation due to the blade to blade manufacturing variability. Different tools and methods such as a frequency based mistuning assessment tool geometry based mistuning assessment tool damping response assessment tool response surface approach mistuning friction prediction tool or combinations thereof may be used to determine the response of mistuning and damping to the airfoils . It is to be understood that when applying method to other gas turbine engine components such as cases or combustor liners determining a response to mistuning may not be applicable.

At a next step the damped mistuned response from step may be combined with results from the emulators of step in order to achieve a comprehensive HCF analysis. As shown in the system of damping data and mistuning data along with tuned system vibratory stresses predicted from step in and results from mistuning analysis step may be used for model validation of the at least one emulator combined with the damped mistuned response. Moreover the damping data mistuning data tuned system vibratory stresses and mistuning analysis may also be used to generate mistuned vibratory stresses . In combining the emulators with the response from damping and mistuning a global dynamics of the entire array of airfoils such as a variation in airfoil response that results from the coupling between airfoils is accounted for in the HCF risk assessment.

Lastly at a final step of the method based on the parametric data flexible models emulators and response to damping and mistuning the distribution of vibratory stress levels may be predicted. The combined damped mistuned response with the emulators may be used to quantify HCF risk across the design manufacturing and anticipated or actual usage space. As shown in HCF material properties and mission data may also be input into the system to generate a material model and usage model of the component. Bringing together results from the mistuned vibratory stresses material model usage model and a damage accumulation model a probability of HCF risk may be predicted. For example the system may output a distribution of stress levels frequencies mode shapes vibratory stresses and HCF risk on the component.

The distribution of stresses and probability of HCF may be displayed over the parameter space in the form a histogram or the like. After analyzing the stress distribution in relation to the input parametric data parameters that most contribute to the probability of HCF risk may be identified. The HCF risk may be compared against risk criteria to determine whether the level of HCF risk is allowable. The input data for the identified parameters may then be changed and the component design may be targeted to generate a narrow distribution of stresses. By constraining the variability on the identified parameters the design of the component may be optimized to reduce the risk of HCF. In addition existing manufacturing data computational fluid dynamics results laser holography strain gages non interference stress measurement system data experimental data and bench spin and engine test data may be used to validate the output distribution of frequencies mode shapes and vibratory stresses on the component.

It is to be understood that the disclosed system and method may be applied to any component of the gas turbine engine in addition to airfoils. Furthermore the disclosed system and method may be modified to evaluate HCF risk in any component of the gas turbine engine. For example system modules and method steps may be modified without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the teachings of this disclosure can find industrial application in any number of different situations including but not limited to gas turbine engines. Such engines may be used for example on aircraft for generating thrust or in land marine or aircraft applications for generating power.

The present disclosure provides a system and method for assessing HCF risk in the design of gas turbine engines. The system and method disclosed herein utilizes a novel probabilistic approach that accounts for inherent variability in a manufactured part of the gas turbine engine. By leveraging computational tools flexible modeling techniques and emulation methods the disclosed system and method better quantifies HCF risk across the design manufacturing and anticipated usage space and provides for a more comprehensive analysis of the distribution of stress levels frequencies mode shapes and vibratory stresses in or on the part. Using the design analysis and validation techniques disclosed herein an optimal design of the part may be achieved to reduce the probability of HCF risk which thereby results in a longer part life extended engine life reduced maintenance costs and improved aircraft safety.

While the foregoing detailed description has been given and provided with respect to certain specific embodiments it is to be understood that the scope of the disclosure should not be limited to such embodiments but that the same are provided simply for enablement and best mode purposes. The breadth and spirit of the present disclosure is broader than the embodiments specifically disclosed and encompassed within the claims appended hereto.
