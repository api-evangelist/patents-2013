title: Transparent armor construction
abstract: A transparent armor construction having a laminate structure with at least two layers. The layers are constructed of two different materials selected from the group of glass, ceramic, resin, polymeric material, and plastic and in which the at least two layers include different coefficients of thermal expansion. The layers are bonded together and a planar frame having an open central section and an outer border is then bonded to the laminate structure. The material for the planar frame is selected so that it has a coefficient of thermal expansion less than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the laminate layer to which it is bonded.

Transparent armor has long been used for armored vehicles in both military and nonmilitary applications. Such transparent armor is typically used for the windows of such vehicles and thus must be transparent or at least substantially transparent.

Oftentimes the previously known transparent armor is a laminate structure of ceramics glasses resins and polymers in an asymmetric design that is sufficient to meet ballistics requirements i.e. the ability to protect personnel from such ballistics. While these previously known laminate structures for transparent armor have functioned adequately to protect personnel from ballistics there have been a number of previously known issues and problems associated with such transparent armor.

Perhaps of most importance is that the previously known transparent armor suffers both degradation and failure due in large part to the residual thermal stresses that are present in such asymmetric designs when subjected to extreme temperatures. Such degradation and failure includes fractures loss of dimensional tolerances due to bending of the transparent armor delamination fogging and debonding. When this occurs the windows must be replaced at significant cost.

A primary source of degradation and failure of the transparent armor arises from the different materials of the layers that form the laminate which have different coefficients of thermal expansion. These laminates of dissimilar materials having different coefficients of thermal expansion have effectively limited the temperature range for the transparent armor or windows before a failure may occur. For example typically such failure occurs at temperatures of about 30 Centigrade or warmer for both lightweight transparent armor as well as transparent armor for heavy duty vehicles. However many vehicles for example military vehicles must be able to operate at temperatures below 30 Centigrade without failure.

In addition bonding of two dissimilar materials having a high differential coefficient of thermal expansion i.e. bonding glass to polymer itself induces a thermal stress in the resulting laminate. These stresses can cause the premature failure from fracture debonding or deformation of the laminate.

In order to limit the stress caused by a high differential of the coefficient of thermal expansion between adjacent laminate layers it has been previously known to mitigate the stresses by using compliant bonding agents as well as lower temperature processing methods to produce the laminate. However in many circumstances these mitigation techniques are only marginally successful. Indeed where the laminate includes layers of both glass and ceramic plastic the differential coefficient of thermal expansion is still high and the processing temperatures also high that failure of the resulting laminate transparent armor is common.

The present invention provides transparent armor which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known transparent armor.

In brief the transparent armor typically a window of the present invention includes a laminate having at least two and more frequently many layers of planar material. These layers are constructed from different materials selected from the group of glass ceramic resin polymeric material and plastics which are all transparent or at least substantially transparent. Such materials often have different coefficients of thermal expansion.

A first bonding material such as polyurethane or polyvinyl butyral bonds the two layers together. Conventional bonding techniques e.g. heating the laminate structure to a predetermined elevated temperature typically in excess of 200 Fahrenheit are employed to bond the laminate layers together.

Unlike the previously known transparent armor in the present invention a planar frame having an open central portion and a continuous outer border is bonded to the laminate by conventional bonding material so that the outer edge of the border of the frame is positioned closely adjacent the outer edge of the laminate. Furthermore the frame is preferably bonded to the laminate layer for the material having the greatest differential coefficient of thermal expansion relative to the frame.

Wide varieties of different materials may be used to form the frame. However preferably a metal or metal alloy constructed from steel iron aluminum titanium magnesium and or alloys thereof is used for the material of the frame. Other types of nonmetallic material such as fiber polymer composite material may alternatively be used.

In operation the metal has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the laminate layer to which it is bonded. Consequently the frame effectively limits the thermal expansion of the layer to which it is bonded and in doing so minimizes bending and cracking of the laminate around its edges.

With reference first to a preferred embodiment of the transparent armor according to the present invention is illustrated. The transparent armor illustrated in the drawing is shown as a rectangular window but the transparent armor may be of any shape without deviation from the spirit or scope of the invention.

The transparent armor includes a laminate structure and as such includes a plurality of different layers of material which together form the laminate structure . These layers of material are all transparent or at least semi transparent and each layer may be constructed of any of a wide range of different transparent materials. These materials include for example glass ceramic resin thermosetting resins such as polycarbonate polymeric materials plastic and others. However at least two of the layers are constructed from different materials and each has a coefficient of thermal expansion that differs from the other.

Conventional processing is performed to bond the layers together. For example any bonding material such as polyurethane or polyvinyl butyral may be disposed between adjacent layers and the entire resulting laminate structure heated to bond the layers of the laminate together.

Each ply or layer of the laminate structure is not only planar but also preferably continuous across the entire transparent armor. However as shown in one or more of the layers may be constructed from individual tiles if desired.

Unlike the previously known transparent armor the transparent armor of the present invention includes a frame having an open central portion and a border is bonded to either the front or back or inside of the laminate structure . As best shown in the outer periphery of the border is positioned closely adjacent the outermost edge of the laminate structure .

With reference to the frame may alternatively be recessed into one or more layers of the laminate structure so that the frame is substantially flush with one end of the laminate structure . Similarly the frame may be positioned within the laminate as shown in .

Any conventional processing techniques may be utilized to attach the frame to the side of the laminate structure . However the same bonding materials such as polyurethane or polyvinyl butyral preferably are utilized to bond the frame to the laminate structure . Furthermore the frame may be bonded to the laminate structure at the same time that the individual layers of the laminate structure are bonded together so that the bonding of both the layers to each other as well as bonding the frame to the laminate structure occur during the same procedure.

The frame itself is constructed of a stiff material such as steel iron aluminum titanium magnesium other metals and or alloys thereof. Alternatively the frame may be constructed of S glass E glass polymers carbon fibers graphite and Z stitched composites.

The material for the frame is selected so that the coefficient of thermal expansion of the frame is substantially the same as one or more layers in the laminate structure but lower than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the layer to which the frame is bonded. Consequently the material selection for the frame will vary as a function of the materials used for the layers of the laminate structure .

In operation due to the differential coefficient of thermal expansion between the frame and the layer to which it is bonded the frame restrains the thermal expansion of the laminate structure as well as minimizes any bending of the laminate structure around its edges. In practice it has been found that the transparent armor of the present invention can effectively operate in temperatures as low as 70 Centigrade without serious degradation of the structure of the transparent armor .

Having described our invention many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
