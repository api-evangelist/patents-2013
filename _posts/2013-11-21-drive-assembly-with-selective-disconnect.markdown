This invention was made at least in part with U.S. Government support under the Boeing contract number 475120 awarded by the United States Air Force. The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to drives used with electro mechanical actuators and in particular to a system and method for disengaging a drive and electro mechanical actuator used in aircraft.

Aircraft typically include electro mechanical actuators and other flight control systems that control flight control surfaces on aircraft wing and tail structures. These flight control surfaces are moved and positioned to alter the lift characteristics of the wing and tail structures. For safety aircraft usually have redundancies in the electro mechanical actuators and flight control systems that control the flight control surfaces to allow for controlled maneuverability of the aircraft in the event that the primary system malfunctions or fails. When the primary system malfunctions the backup system takes over and controls the movable flight control surface. The primary system may have become stuck or jammed in one position making it difficult for the backup system to overcome the primary system and control the flight control surface.

A drive assembly with selective disconnect includes a motor with a motor drive shaft a harmonic drive coupled to the motor drive shaft an output shaft coupled to the harmonic drive and a retracting mechanism that selectively retracts the motor drive shaft and the wave generator of the harmonic drive axially to decouple the motor drive shaft and wave generator from the harmonic drive.

A method includes driving an output shaft with a motor drive shaft through a harmonic drive located between the output shaft and the motor drive shaft and disconnecting the output shaft from the motor drive shaft by selectively decoupling the motor drive shaft and the wave generator from the harmonic drive.

Motor drive shaft is at least partially within motor and receives energy from motor . The energy received by motor drive shaft from motor causes motor drive shaft to rotate. One end of motor drive shaft when in an engaged position as will be discussed below is engaged coupled to harmonic drive which in turn is connected coupled to output shaft . Output shaft is connected to and drives actuator which can be used for a variety of purposes including in an aircraft to control a movable flight control surface such as an aileron or an elevator. The other end of motor drive shaft is adjacent to retracting mechanism . Connected to output shaft motor and retracting mechanism is controller . Controller receives feedback signals from motor output shaft and actuator and provide instruction or command signals to motor and retracting mechanism .

Motor may be an electric motor hydraulic motor pneumatic motor or fuel combustion motor or other type of motor that is able to receive energy from another source and convert it to mechanical work in the form of rotating motor drive shaft . Motor drive shaft may be made from any suitable material such as steel or another alloy and is most commonly cylindrical in shape. Motor drive shaft may have a solid core or may be hollow depending on design considerations and if there is a need to reduce weight. The core of motor drive shaft may also be a different material than the shell. Motor should be configured such that motor drive shaft is accessible from either end so as to allow for one end to be engaged coupled to harmonic drive while the other end is adjacent to retracting mechanism . Motor may contain sensors that monitor motor to detect any malfunctions or failures. The sensors are configured to communicate with controller and inform controller of any malfunctions or failures in motor . Motor is configured to rotate motor drive shaft thereby enabling motor drive shaft to perform work.

At one end of motor drive shaft is harmonic drive which is a gear reduction that includes of a wave generator flex gear or flex spline and a ring gear or ring spline which will be discussed below in conjunction with . The configuration and functionality of a harmonic drive is known in the art but will be described in greater detail below. Harmonic drive is coupled to motor drive shaft and output shaft and transfers energy between motor drive shaft and output shaft .

Output shaft is a drive shaft that receives energy from motor drive shaft through harmonic drive . Output shaft may be made from any suitable material such as steel or another alloy and is most commonly cylindrical. Output shaft may have a solid core or may be hollow depending on design considerations and if there is a need to reduce weight. The core of output shaft may also be a different material than the shell.

Output shaft is attached to actuator . Actuator may be any electro mechanical actuator hinged line actuator or any other device equipped to receive rotational energy from output shaft and convert it to a useful end such as moving a flight control surface on an aircraft. Additionally actuator may be configured to convert rotational motion into linear motion. Actuator as used in an aircraft wing or tail may be a hinged line actuator that works to control a movable control surface such as an aileron or elevator for a flight control system.

Retracting mechanism is located opposite harmonic drive at the other end of motor drive shaft . shows Retracting mechanism attached to motor drive shaft but retracting mechanism may have other configurations as will be discussed with regards to . Retracting mechanism is configured to retract motor drive shaft when provided instruction or command signal B from controller . When motor drive shaft is retracted motor drive shaft disengages and decouples from harmonic drive . Once disengaged energy from motor drive shaft is no longer transferred to output shaft . Conversely output shaft can no longer transfer energy to motor drive shaft . Retracting mechanism may also be configured to move motor drive shaft back into its original position so as to engage couple motor drive shaft to harmonic drive and allow energy to be transferred between motor drive shaft and output shaft .

Controller may be electrically connected to every other component in drive assembly with selective disconnect to determine the functionality of the system as a whole and or each component within drive assembly with selective disconnect . In controller is connected to motor output shaft and actuator to receive feedback signals C B and A respectively and motor and retracting mechanism to provide instruction or command signals A and B respectively. If in an aircraft controller may also be connected to other components of the aircraft so as to give and receive information regarding aircraft functionality. After receiving feedback signals A C and determining that drive assembly with selective disconnect is not properly functioning to control actuator or other components controller will provide instruction or command signal A to power off motor as well as instruction or command signal B to retracting mechanism to retract motor drive shaft which disengages decouples motor drive shaft from harmonic drive and prevents energy from being transferred between motor drive shaft and output shaft . Feedback signals A C provided to controller may result in controller instructing motor to power off and retracting mechanism to disengage decouple motor drive shaft . Such a result may be caused by any number of issues such as a notification that output shaft is not moving or receiving energy from harmonic drive or that actuator is malfunctioning or that motor is not producing the proper amount of rotational energy based on the energy drawn of motor or that motor drive shaft has failed or malfunctioned.

Upon feedback signals A C or other inputs into controller that show drive assembly with selective disconnect will function properly once in use again controller will provide the following instructions or command signals instruction or command signal A to motor to power on and rotate motor drive shaft and instruction or command signal B to retracting mechanism to move motor drive shaft into its original position to engaged couple motor drive shaft to harmonic drive . Thereby configuring drive assembly with selective disconnect to use energy from motor to drive output shaft and actuator .

Drive assembly with selective disconnect is advantageous because of the ability to disengage decouple motor drive shaft from harmonic drive output shaft and actuator . It is advantageous to disengage decouple motor drive shaft from harmonic drive because many machines such as movable flight control systems in aircrafts contain redundant systems that take over the duties of actuator in the event of failure to motor motor drive shaft and or output shaft . When failure of the primary system occurs a backup system takes over and can more easily function to move the control systems and perform the duties of actuator if the backup system does not have to overcome the resistance on output shaft caused by output shaft being coupled to motor drive shaft and motor through harmonic drive . Thus disengaging motor drive shaft from harmonic drive and output shaft prevents wasted energy from transferring from the backup system through output shaft to motor drive shaft and the other components of drive assembly with selective disconnect . If motor drive shaft did not decouple from harmonic drive in the event of failure and when the backup system is functioning the backup system would have to overcome the resistance of actuator output shaft harmonic drive motor drive shaft and motor to function. Drive assembly with selective disconnect because it disengages decouples motor drive shaft from harmonic drive allows the backup system to be more efficient and reliable. Additionally disengaging decoupling motor drive shaft from harmonic drive prevents the system output shaft and actuator from becoming jammed in place upon failure or malfunction. Such a jam could result in an inability to control an aircraft in flight if the actuator is used to control a movable flight control surface.

Drive assembly with selective disconnect of includes motor motor drive shaft harmonic drive output shaft and retracting mechanism . Harmonic drive includes wave generator flex gear and ring gear . Retracting mechanism includes solenoid locking mechanism lock ball retainer lock ball bearings spring and reconnect sleeve . In motor drive shaft near retracting mechanism are engaged groove and disengaged groove . Drive assembly with selective disconnect also includes stroke spline and guide ball bearings .

Motor is at least partially radially outward from motor drive shaft which forms the centerline about which motor drive shaft harmonic drive and many other components of drive assembly with selective disconnect are centered. Motor is radially outward from an area near the middle of motor drive shaft and allows motor drive shaft to extend out from both sides of motor . Motor may be any motor that provides mechanical energy in the form of rotating motor drive shaft such as an electric motor a fuel motor or another type of motor.

Motor drive shaft may be cylindrical and constructed from any suitable material such as a metal an alloy or other material that is able to handle the stresses caused by rotation of motor drive shaft at high speeds. Motor drive shaft should be strong enough in the axial direction to transfer energy from motor to harmonic drive without substantial deformation. Motor drive shaft should also be strong enough to be able to be pulled from one end to move axially without deformation. Additionally the diameter of motor drive shaft may decrease in a stair step manner along the axial direction of motor drive shaft the closer motor drive shaft is to harmonic drive which is adjacent to one end of motor drive shaft .

Radially between motor and motor drive shaft is stroke spline and guide ball bearings which keep motor drive shaft from radial movement. Stroke spline is annular with a flange extending radially outward at the end furthest from harmonic drive and may be made from a variety of materials including a metal or alloy. Stroke spline has a plurality of holes aligned axially around the circumference to provide a space for guide ball bearings which sit in the holes and contact motor drive shaft so as to provide a support surface that has a low coefficient of friction. Guide ball bearings are spherical ball bearings that may be made from any material that is sufficiently hard to adequately provide support to motor drive shaft while also having a low coefficient of friction with motor drive shaft and stroke spline to reduce wear and increase efficiency. While show two rows of guide ball bearings in stroke spline other embodiments may include a different configuration or may not even include stroke spline or guide ball bearings if such components are not needed to keep motor drive shaft from moving radially.

Harmonic drive is adjacent to one end and radially outward from motor drive shaft . Harmonic drive is a harmonic drive or strain wave gearing that is known to one of skill in the art and includes going from radially inward to radially outward wave generator flex gear and ring gear . Motor drive shaft is connected to wave generator such that if motor drive shaft moves axially wave generator also moves axially. Wave generator has a cross section that is rectangular with semi circles on each end. On the radially inner side of wave generator is motor drive shaft and on the radially outer side is flex gear . Between wave generator and motor drive shaft may be a lubricant to reduce friction and wear between wave generator and flex gear so as to improve durability and efficiency.

Flex gear has wave generator on the radially inner side and ring gear on the radially outer side. Flex gear may be or have another cross section but in has a cross section that is substantially oval or elliptical when wave generator is radially within flex gear . Flex gear is smooth on the radially inner surface to allow for wave generator to easily slide as wave generator rotates and has teeth on the radially outer surface that when rotated fit into teeth on the inner surface of ring gear . Flex gear is made from a flexible material such as spring steel or another suitable material to allow for flex gear to take a shape similar to an oval when wave generator is radially within flex gear . When wave generator is radially within flex gear only the smooth inner surface of flex gear near the semi circular ends of wave generator contact wave generator . As a result only the teeth of flex gear radially outward from the surface that is in contact with wave generator are in contact with ring gear at any one time for flex gear takes on a cross section that is substantially oval while ring gear has a cross section that is circular. As wave generator rotates wave generator slides within flex gear so that flex gear does not rotate at the same angular velocity as wave generator thus there is a gear reduction . Generally while wave generator rotates flex gear rotates at a slower angular velocity

Ring gear is annular and has flex gear on the radially inner side. Because ring gear is annular and flex gear has a substantially oval cross section when wave generator is within flex gear not all of the teeth on the radially inner surface of ring gear contact the teeth on flex gear simultaneously. While show flex gear connected to output shaft while ring gear is anchored either flex gear or ring gear may be connected to output shaft while the other flex gear or ring gear is anchored in place.

The use of harmonic drive as a gear reduction is advantageous because it may be desired to disengage decouple motor drive shaft from harmonic drive and output shaft and later reengage couple motor drive shaft to harmonic drive and output shaft . As will be discussed in greater detail below to disengage motor drive shaft motor drive shaft and wave generator are removed from harmonic drive as shown in so that wave generator is no longer radially within flex gear and ring gear . This prevents the transfer of energy between motor drive shaft and output shaft through harmonic drive . Conversely to reengage motor drive shaft motor drive shaft and wave generator are moved back into harmonic drive so as to position wave generator radially within flex gear and ring gear . Because the outer surface of wave generator and the inner surface of flex gear are smooth and without teeth wave generator and flex gear do not have to be specifically aligned making the insertion of wave generator into harmonic drive substantially easier than with a conventional gear reduction that has teeth on these two surfaces and requires the teeth to be perfectly aligned. One system used to disengage and reengage motor drive shaft and wave generator with harmonic drive is described below.

As mentioned above output shaft may be attached at one end to either flex gear or ring gear and extends as a cylinder or another configuration away from harmonic gear in an opposite direction from motor drive shaft . The other end of output shaft may be attached to any drive or other device that is equipped to receive energy from output shaft and convert it to a useful end such as actuator in . Output shaft may be hollow or solid and made from various materials with sufficient properties to be able to receive rotational energy from harmonic drive and convey it to an actuator or another device. The diameter of output shaft is likely larger than that of motor drive shaft due to output shaft being connected to either flex gear or ring gear .

Adjacent to the other end of motor drive shaft is retracting mechanism . Retracting mechanism include spring which is be radially outward from motor drive shaft and adjacent to stroke spline . One end of spring should be attached to motor drive shaft so as to cause motor drive shaft to move axially when possible. The other end of spring should be anchored. Spring may be one helical spring that coils around motor drive shaft a number of helical springs that are arranged circumferentially around motor drive shaft or another device mechanical or otherwise that is able to push motor drive shaft away from harmonic drive when allowed or prompted. Spring should be sufficiently strong to move motor drive shaft and wave generator out from harmonic drive and overcome the resistance caused by friction between wave generator and flex gear .

Retracting mechanism also includes solenoid which is be located the furthest from motor drive shaft of all the components of retracting mechanism . Solenoid is centered axially along the same centerline that motor drive shaft is centered and extends away from the end of motor drive shaft that is opposite harmonic drive . Solenoid may be pneumatic electro mechanical or another configuration able to retract and pull on locking mechanism to move locking mechanism away from motor drive shaft . While show solenoid configured to pull locking mechanism to unlock motor drive shaft and allow spring to remove motor drive shaft and wave generator from harmonic drive as will be discussed below solenoid may also be configured to directly retract and remove motor drive shaft and wave generator from harmonic drive and conversely to extend and push motor drive shaft and wave generator back into harmonic drive .

Between solenoid and motor drive shaft is locking mechanism which is annular with an open end that is radially outward from motor drive shaft and a closed end that is attached to solenoid . Locking mechanism may have at least one flange on the outer surface to provide structural support. The inner surface of locking mechanism has a tapered portion where the diameter of locking mechanism increases as it gets closer to the end of locking mechanism that is adjacent to motor drive shaft . The inner surface of locking mechanism also has a non tapered portion with a consistent diameter near the closed end of locking mechanism . When solenoid retracts it pulls on locking mechanism moving locking mechanism away from motor drive shaft and unlocking motor drive shaft allowing for axial movement of motor drive shaft and wave generator . In this embodiment spring is used to remove motor drive shaft and wave generator from harmonic drive and reconnect sleeve is used to move motor drive shaft and wave generator back into harmonic drive but both of these tasks could be completed by a solenoid or other device.

Radially outward from solenoid locking mechanism and other components of retracting mechanism is reconnect sleeve which may be one or a number of jack screws or another device able to move motor drive shaft and wave generator towards harmonic drive to engage couple motor drive shaft and wave generator with harmonic drive . Other embodiments may not include reconnect sleeve and may include a solenoid either solenoid or another solenoid capable of pushing motor drive shaft towards harmonic drive .

Radially within locking mechanism at least partially between the annular part of locking mechanism as opposed to the closed end of locking mechanism and motor drive shaft is lock ball retainer . Lock ball retainer is be annular with one end abutting the inner surface of the closed end of locking mechanism and the other end adjacent to motor drive shaft . Lock ball retainer is anchored so as to not move when motor drive shaft or locking mechanism move. The end of lock ball retainer closest to motor drive shaft may not be radially within locking mechanism and may have at least one flange that extends radially outward to provide structural support and other functions. The diameter and thickness of lock ball retainer is substantially consistent throughout the length of lock ball retainer and is not tapered like locking mechanism . Lock ball retainer includes a plurality of holes aligned circumferentially around lock ball retainer at a point near the middle of lock ball retainer when measured along the length of lock ball retainer .

Within the plurality of holes in lock ball retainer are lock ball bearings which are spherical and have a diameter that is greater than the thickness of lock ball retainer so that lock ball bearings protrude from either the inner surface or outer surface of lock ball retainer depending on whether locking mechanism is in the locked position or the unlocked position . When lock ball bearings are radially within the non tapered portion of locking mechanism and when motor drive shaft is in the engaged position as will be discussed below lock ball bearings are at least partially within engaged groove as is shown in .

Engaged groove is an indentation aligned circumferentially around motor drive shaft and along with lock ball bearings prevents axial movement of motor drive shaft . Engaged groove is near the end of motor drive shaft such that when lock ball bearings are within engaged groove motor drive shaft and wave generator are within harmonic drive . When lock ball bearings are radially within the non tapered portion of locking mechanism the inner surface of locking mechanism is pushing on lock ball bearings and when motor drive shaft is in the disengaged position as will be discussed below lock ball bearings are at least partially within disengaged groove as is shown in . Disengaged groove is similar to engaged groove but is closer to harmonic drive such that when lock ball bearings are within disengaged groove motor drive shaft and wave generator are not within harmonic drive .

When lock ball bearings are not being pushed into engaged groove or disengaged groove by the non tapered portion of locking mechanism when lock ball bearings are radially within the tapered portion of locking mechanism lock ball retainer is configured to push through the use of springs or other device lock ball bearings radially outward so that lock ball bearings are not within engaged groove or disengaged groove . In this situation motor drive shaft and wave generator are not prevented from moving axially by lock ball bearings and are able to be removed from or inserted into harmonic drive . The various stages of drive assembly with selective disconnect as motor drive shaft is disengaged from harmonic drive and output shaft are described below.

Drive assembly with selective disconnect is in the engaged locked position during normal working conditions allowing output to drive an actuator or other device. When in this position solenoid has not retracted locking mechanism pushing lock ball bearings into engaged groove . Motor drive shaft is in a forward engaged position and spring is compressed and prevented from pushing motor drive shaft away from harmonic drive by lock ball bearings in engaged groove .

Drive assembly with selective disconnect is in the engaged unlocked position for only a short period of time until spring extends and pushes motor drive shaft away from harmonic drive . Solenoid will be instructed to retract locking mechanism by a control system such as controller that is monitoring drive assembly with selective disconnect . When it is determined that output shaft is malfunctioning so that the actuator or other device driven by output shaft is not functioning properly solenoid will be instructed to retract locking mechanism and begin the process of disengaging decoupling motor drive shaft and wave generator from harmonic drive by removing wave generator from being in contact with flex gear .

When drive assembly with selective disconnect is in a disengaged unlocked position solenoid and locking mechanism are in a retracted position as they were in . Because locking mechanism is retracted by solenoid the tapered portion of locking mechanism is radially outward from lock ball bearings . In this situation the inner surface of the tapered portion of locking mechanism is not pushing on lock ball bearings allowing lock ball bearings to be radially outward from motor drive shaft and not be at least partially within engaged groove or disengaged groove which would prevent motor drive shaft from moving axially . While lock ball bearings are not within disengaged groove in lock ball bearings are aligned in a position radially outward from disengaged groove . Lock ball bearings are in this position because spring has moved motor drive shaft and caused disengaged groove to move axially into alignment with lock ball bearings .

Drive assembly with selective disconnect is in the disengaged unlocked position for only a short period of time until solenoid extends and moves locking mechanism towards harmonic drive which again locks motor drive shaft in place as is shown in . As mentioned above when motor drive shaft is in the disengaged position energy is not transferred between motor drive shaft and output shaft through harmonic drive and output shaft is not restrained or locked in place by motor drive shaft but rather is free to rotate.

Drive assembly with selective disconnect is in the disengaged locked position when it is determined that output shaft is malfunctioning so that the actuator or other device driven by output shaft is not functioning properly. Output shaft and or the actuator or other device connected to output shaft may not be functioning properly because it or another component has failed. As mentioned before once drive assembly with selective disconnect is in the disengaged locked position it will remain there until the system is fixed or has been determined to be working properly. When the system is determined to be working properly reconnect sleeve may then be activated to move motor drive shaft and wave generator back into harmonic drive and reengage motor drive shaft after solenoid has retracted locking mechanism to unlock motor drive shaft and allow for axial movement .

Reengaging inserting motor drive shaft and wave generator into harmonic drive so that wave generator is radially within flex gear requires wave generator to come into contact with the smooth inner surface of flex gear . Because the location of axial movement within harmonic drive is between the smooth outer surface of wave generator and the smooth inner surface of flex gear wave generator does not have to be substantially aligned with flex gear making reengagement easier than it would be with a conventional gear reduction that has teeth on these two surfaces and requires the teeth to be perfectly aligned.

Additionally drive assembly with selective disconnect is advantageous because it allows motor drive shaft to be disengaged decoupled from harmonic drive and output shaft so any backup system does not have to overcome the resistance that motor drive shaft provides by being coupled to output shaft . Because motor drive shaft is decoupled from output shaft output shaft does not become stuck or jammed in place providing a safer and more easily fixed system.

A drive assembly with selective disconnect may include a motor with a motor drive shaft a harmonic drive coupled to one end of the motor drive shaft an output shaft coupled to the harmonic drive and a retracting mechanism that selectively retracts the motor drive shaft axially to decouple the motor drive shaft from the harmonic drive.

The drive assembly with selective disconnect of the preceding paragraph can optionally include additionally and or alternatively any one or more of the following features configurations and or additional components.

The wave generator is retracted out of the harmonic drive when the retracting mechanism selectively retracts the motor drive shaft.

The retracting mechanism selectively retracts the motor drive shaft axially in response to feedback from the output shaft or the electric motor.

The retracting mechanism may further include a locking mechanism located at another end of the motor drive shaft the locking mechanism having a first end and a second end the first end located radially outside the motor drive shaft a solenoid connected to the second end of the locking mechanism the solenoid selectively retracts the locking mechanism axially to move the locking mechanism from a locked position to an unlocked position and a spring attached to the motor drive shaft the spring retracts the motor drive shaft when the solenoid moves the locking mechanism into an unlocked position.

The solenoid selectively moves the locking mechanism axially from the unlocked position to the locked position

The radially inner surface of the locking mechanism is partially tapered to allow a plurality of ball bearings to move radially outward as the locking mechanism is retracted into the unlocked position and radially inward as the locking mechanism is moved into the locked position

The locking mechanism is in the locked position when the plurality of ball bearings are located in a groove radially around the motor drive shaft.

A method may include driving an output shaft with a motor drive shaft through a harmonic drive located between the output shaft and the motor drive shaft and disconnecting the output shaft from the motor drive shaft by selectively decoupling the motor drive shaft from the harmonic drive.

The method of the preceding paragraph can optionally include additionally and or alternatively any one or more of the following features configurations and or additional components.

The motor drive shaft is attached to a wave generator within the harmonic drive and the wave generator is retracted from the harmonic drive when the motor drive shaft is disconnected from the harmonic drive.

A solenoid selectively retracts a locking mechanism to unlock the motor drive shaft and allow the spring to retract the motor drive shaft and the wave generator.

The motor drive shaft and wave generator selectively retract in response to feedback from the electric motor motor drive shaft or output shaft.
