title: Content storage mapping
abstract: A data storage method and system. The method includes defining, by a computing system, a meta-object, a schema based structured definition for the meta-object, and a taxonomy with configuration data. The computing system creates content associated with the taxonomy and associates topics of the content with a logical storage room representations. Reference coordinates associated with the logical storage room representations are associated with the taxonomy. The computing system generates updated configuration data that includes the reference coordinates and a uniform resource identifier associated with the content is generated. The computing system generates an account associated with the meta-object for a user. Metering charges for usage of the account and a report associated with the account and usage are generated.

As an example address space 001.Field i.e. on the X axis or pointer address space 001.Record i.e. on the Y axis or pointer and address space 001.File i.e. on the Z axis or pointer may be simultaneously viewed and accessed.

Logical diagram represents three dimensional planes i.e. Y plane of a room an X plane of a room and a Z plane of a room of a logical storage room representation. A room is defined herein as a logical reference to a specific topic that a user would have access to use within system of . X Y and Z coordinates in logical diagram represent each dimensional plane of a three dimensional POV i.e. Y plane of a room an X plane of a room and a Z plane of a room . Collectively a combination of X Y and Z coordinates represent a specified POV within a viewing space. Enumerated subject areas 001 008 are defined differently for each dimensional plane X Y and Z of a user accessible topic i.e. room . For example if a Topic of a Room is Smart Devices subject areas 005 represent a multi dimensional hierarchical relationship of content relevant to the topic Smart Devices . For Example Z 005 subject area comprises a referenced component within a smart device Y 005 comprises a sensor within the component and X 005 comprises defined attributes of the sensors. In this example i.e. in reference to this room as the user moves along the Z axis he she moves between various components. As the user moves along the Y axis his her references to specific a sensor changes. As the user moves along the X axis his her references to sensor attributes changes. Therefore in this example the point of view POV would represent a specific attribute within a specific sensor within a certain component being referenced with the topic of smart devices.

As an example address space 009.Record i.e. on the X axis or pointer address space 009.File i.e. on the Y axis or pointer and address space 009.Directory i.e. on the Z axis or pointer may be simultaneously viewed and accessed.

Logical diagram represents three dimensions i.e. Y plane of a room an X plane of a room and a Z plane of a room of a logical storage room representation. For example if a Topic of a Room is Smart Grid subject areas 005 represent a multi dimensional hierarchical relationship of content relevant to the topic Smart Grid . In this example Z 005 subject area comprises a referenced smart device within the Smart Grid Y 005 comprises a component within the smart device and X 005 comprises a sensor with the component. Logical diagram of represents a next level within a hierarchical taxonomy of related content between rooms. Taxonomies exist within room and between rooms and as the user moves between rooms they traverse through adjoining taxonomies. Within rooms configuration data provides cross reference mapping of the X Y and Z coordinates to multi dimensional subject areas as defined with room taxonomies. The DOORS system manages this level of complexity and simultaneous multi dimensional navigational access through its unique data access layer.

As a first example physical disk drives have tracks and cylinders. In a DOORS system a disk may represent a Z axis a cylinder may represent a Y axis and tracks may represent an X axis.

As a second example an aggregation of storage devices into a storage access network SAN may include a SAN representing a Z axis reference a list of storage devices within the SAN representing a Y axis reference and a disk within the storage device representing an X axis reference. A SAN comprises an architecture to attach remote computer storage devices such as disk arrays tape libraries and optical jukeboxes to servers in such a way that the devices appear as locally attached to the operating system. A SAN as described in the second example enables multiple translation of a same reference point depending on a perspective of point of view POV . A multi perspective 3D Point of view design may be translated to a logical multiple layer storage translation at a shared address space and increase storage capacity with the use of more sophisticated translation pointers.

DOORS access bus component H1 The DOORS access bus component H1 comprises an addressable service interface that exposes interesting aspects of a data set through a reference to its resources. Each resource i.e. a meta object has its own unique URI. The URI is a logical link reference to an underlying accessed resource and enables an application using the DOORS data access layer a URI interface via a DOORS application programming interface API . The API translates a URI interface passed parameter to DOOR data access layer logical component H2 i.e. a next layer of the DOORS data access layer . 12. DOORS data access logic components H2 DOORS data access logic components H2 allow applications and services access to a data store. DOORS data access layer logic components H2 are intelligently aware after a translation of a request from H1 of what is being requested what the user has access to where the information is located additional relevant information pertinent to the request and through what perspective viewpoint it should retrieve and or store the information to or from a plurality of storage media sources and or physical storage locations. For example a retail application must retrieve product data from a database to display product details to a user and insert order details into a database when a user places an order. DOORS data access logic components H2 abstracts logic necessary to access data in a separate layer of data access logic components thereby centralizing data access functionality through unique intelligent capabilities. 13. DOORS service agent component H3 DOORS service agent component H3 manages the semantics of coordinating communication between the DOORS data access layer logic components H2 and a particular remote service e.g. when a business component must use functionality provided in an external service . For example business components of a retail application may use a service agent to manage communication with a credit card authorization service and use a second service agent to handle conversations with a courier service. DOORS service agent component H3 isolates idiosyncrasies of calling diverse services from an remote application and provides additional services helper service such as inter alia pre processing a basic mapping between a format of data exposed by a service and a format that an application using the DOORS Data Access Layer requires. 14.
