The present invention relates generally to bio fuel systems and more specifically in one embodiment to a bio oil extraction system for extracting oil found within the cells of algae while simultaneously separating the oil water and algae husk in one step for efficient processing into bio oil by means of variable shock on shock interaction.

Bio fuels are fuels that are derived from biological feedstock sources such as trees corn miscanthus and algae. These bio fuels have been sought out as an alternative to fossil fuels to decrease dependence on fossil fuels stabilize the price of oil and reduce the carbon footprint from the use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are primarily produced from hydrocarbons extracted from below the earth s surface. Much of this crude comes from foreign sources which represents a security and price risk to the United States economy in general. Furthermore military operations require a stable source of power when conducting overseas operations particularly in remote or hostile areas.

Of the various types of feedstock algae shows the greatest promise because it is sustainable in a majority of growing regions and can produce a nearly 100 fold yield per acre compared with other feedstock sources. However this increased yield is costly in that only expensive filtering and thermal cracking means have been employed to extract the oil from the algae.

United States patent application 20110095225 published Apr. 28 2011 to Eckelberry et al. discloses methods systems and apparatuses for extracting non polar lipids from microalgae using a lipid extraction device having an anode and a cathode that forms a channel and defines a fluid flow path through which an aqueous slurry is passed. An electromotive force is applied across the channel at a gap distance in a range from 0.5 mm to 200 mm to cause the non polar lipids to be released from the algae cells. The non polar lipids can be extracted at a high throughput rate and with low concentrations of polar lipids such as phospholipids and chlorophyll.

One problem with this prior art is it requires a large amount of power to force an electrical current through the aqueous slurry which is highly resistant due to the water present in the slurry.

Hielscher GmBh a company out of Teltow Germany proposes using ultrasound to fracture various crops and extract the oil by means of bubble cavitation techniques.

However the present invention simplifies oil extraction using lower power demand and flow through processing thereby reducing the cost of facility construction and operation. Accordingly those of skill in the art will appreciate the present invention which addresses the above discussed and other problems.

It is one possible object of the present invention to provide an improved bio oil extraction system generating a greater yield of biofuel from feedstock.

Another possible object of the present invention is to provide a more efficient bio oil extraction system having a lower power demand compared with currently used techniques.

Another possible object of the invention is to provide a bio oil extraction system requiring only one step for separating oil water and husk from algae cells and or other feedstock.

Another possible object of the invention is to provide a bio oil extraction system which utilizes colliding shock waves to extract biofuel from feedstock.

Another possible object of the invention is to provide a bio oil extraction system which utilizes sonic waves produced by opposing transducer arrays to extract biofuel from feedstock.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein by way of illustration and example an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there is shown a schematic view of one possible bio oil extraction system that may include shock wave bio oil extraction housing extraction tank gravity clarifier tanks and pulse controller in accord with one possible embodiment of the invention.

It will be noted that shock wave housing is not limited to the configuration of any particular extraction system such as that of bio extraction system . In one possible embodiment bio oil extraction system or possibly other configurations thereof implement the feed shock wave housing the capture and the continued refinement of separation of oil from the feedstock for ease of reference and explanation.

In this embodiment algae tank houses a quantity of mature algae to be used in bio oil extraction system . In one embodiment algae tank may be augmented with CO2 nourishing system to increase the volume of mature algae present in algae tank . Algae tank is provided with outlet pipe and corresponding valves and or controls that allow mature algae to flow via gravity or pump into shock wave bio oil extraction housing .

Turning now to there is shown a schematic view in cross section of shock wave bio oil extraction housing in accord with one possible embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment shock wave bio oil extraction housing comprises walls that support opposing high powered transducer arrays. The cross sectional view of shows one possible set of opposing arrays A B but numerous arrays may be built into the walls of shock wave housing without departing from the scope of the invention. Pulse controller may utilize various power lines to connect to the transducer arrays. Pulse controller modulates the frequency and pulse rate of opposing transducer arrays such as opposing transducer arrays A B to break down the algae cell releasing water biomass and most importantly bio oil. Opposing transducer arrays A B may comprise high powered transducer arrays such as those found in lithotripsy medical equipment and naval sonar systems.

In operation mature algae flow out of algae tank to shock wave bio oil extraction housing . The water algae slurry enters the housing as pulse controller excites transducers A B. Transducers A B induce sonic waves of selectable frequencies to impinge upon mature algae cells. Sonic waves including hyper sonic and ultra sonic from opposing transducer arrays A B and equal harmonics travel through the water column and collide. Opposing transducer arrays A B each have axis which in this embodiment is perpendicular with respect to the flow path of feedstock. In one possible embodiment depending on construction of the transducers axis can define the path or main direction along which the power of the sonic waves will travel from opposing transducer arrays A B. As used herein the axis of the transducer is representative of the direction of travel of the power of the sonic waves utilized as described herein. At the collision line of the sonic waves shearing plane is induced which causes the cell walls of mature algae to collapse together while the shock interaction creates a perpendicular shearing plane both of which combine to separate the oil and water from the algae cell.

Using pulse controller to vary the firing sequences frequencies and waveforms of opposing transducer arrays A B shearing plane can be rapidly induced throughout the entire water column to effectively and efficiently separate oil or lipids from water and husk by products of mature algae .

Referring back to shock wave bio oil extraction housing is connected downstream via tubular plumbing to extraction tank . Extraction tank has top plumbing exit and bottom plumbing exit near the bottom. Top plumbing exit feeds the processed algae to clarifier tank while bottom plumbing exit returns any mature algae remaining in extraction tank back to be processed again through shock wave bio oil extraction housing .

Given enough time in extraction tank separate layers of oil water and biomass would form over time due to gravity separation. However since a continuous process is desirable the processed culture is sent to one or more clarifier tanks to provide for gravity separation allowing extraction tank to continue processing mature algae . The processed culture flows downstream into clarifier tanks whereby the partially settled mix is allowed to fully separate via gravity. After sufficient time oil is extracted from the top layer into line or holding tank . Water may be piped back via line or water holding tank for recycling. Any biomass remaining in clarifier tanks is directed into hopper . The remaining biomass collected in hopper can be used for many other agricultural purposes or cellulose feedstock for refining cellulose into bio fuel.

In another embodiment the induction of air bubbles not shown in extraction tank can be utilized to further speed up the separation of oil from the water slurry.

In the embodiment depicted an octagonal profile is used for transducer arrays A B A B A B A and B. However other profiles are possible such as but not limited to hexagonal square and even circular profiles. Furthermore the number of opposing transducer arrays is not limited to a particular number and multiple arrays could be used consistent with the teachings of the present invention.

Referring to a side view of possible moveable shock stem zones or shearing regions created by the shock waves is shown in accord with one possible embodiment of the present invention. Similar to shearing plane as described in stem shock zones or shearing regions A B C D are additional shearing planes generated by the system. The location and angles of the shearing planes will change depending upon the shape of housing as well as the arrangement of transducer arrays A B and the timing.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
