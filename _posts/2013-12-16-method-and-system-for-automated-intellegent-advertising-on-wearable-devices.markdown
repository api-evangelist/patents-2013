This application relates to automatic processing of electronic information. More specifically it relates to a method and system for automated intelligent advertising.

The Internet and World Wide Web have changed the way organizations conduct business. Virtually every organization has a web site that provides information about the organization and a description of the goods and or services an organization may offer. As is known in the art a web site is group of related mark up language documents and associated graphics and multi media files scripts and databases etc. that are served up by a server on the World Wide Web via the Internet. Business organizations also provide an electronic commerce e commerce interface that allows users to purchase goods and or services from such organizations.

There are many different type of web sites on a spectrum ranging from very simple to very complex. Designing implementing and deploying a web site requires knowledge of markup languages such as Hyper Text Markup Language HTML eXtensible Markup Language XML programming languages such as JAVA C C computer graphics functionality multi media functionality etc. A knowledge of communications protocols such as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP Transmission Control Protocol TCP Internet Protocol IP e mail protocols such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP e commerce protocols encryption and other security protocols and many other types of protocols for various kinds of web functionalities.

With the proliferation of cell phones and other technology the payphone and traditional telephone industry has seen a rapid decline in revenue including advertising revenues.

Wearable devices are becoming more popular. The calculator watch introduced in the 1980s was one of the original wearable devices. A few other examples includes a Bluetooth headset in a pair of earrings with a hidden microphone a Spy Tie with a color video camera a Pocket Tweet with a Java application applying a TWITTER text bubble to a person s shirt with Tweets ZED phones stitched headphones into beanies and headbands allowing riders snowboarders drivers and runners to stay connected hands free etc.

Wearable technology has applications in monitoring and real time feedback for athletes as well. Transitioning to night life and entertainment industries electroluminescent shirts have appeared in concerts SONY developed a smart wig This Smartwig includes a Global Positioning System GPS a camera and a laser pointer system and connects to other devices.

The digital glasses such as GOOGLE Glass include prototypes for digital eyewear with heads up display HUD are being developed. The US military also employs headgear with displays for soldiers using a technology called holographic optics.

Smart watches by SONY NIKE SAMSUNG and others are additional examples. ABI Research forecasts about 1.2 million smart watches will be shipped in 2013 due to high penetration of smart phones in many world markets the wide availability and low cost of MicroElectroMechanical Systems MEMS sensors energy efficient connectivity technologies such as Bluetooth 4.0 and a flourishing app ecosystem.

According to ABI Research due to the relative ease of compatibility with smart phones and other electronic devices the wearable technologies market will likely spike to about 485 million annual device shipments by 2018.

Commercial web sites offer many different types of electronic advertisements. The advertisements typically include electronic links to advertiser s web sites. There are many problems associated with designing implementing and deploying advertising on a web site.

Another problem is that many types of online advertising are considered spam. Another problem is that pop up advertising is being block by operating systems such as Windows XP and add on software. This pop up blocking is becoming a standard feature in many operating systems. Another problem is that banner ads and pay per click ads are no longer an effective means of advertising online.

Electronic mail e mail is one of the most common types of electronic information sent and received. E mail is sent and received over public networks such as the Internet and many private networks such as intranets local area networks LAN etc.

Advertisers and other information providers are always looking for new ways to use existing technologies such as e mail for advertising. There are many free e mail services that routinely add advertising to user s e mail as a condition of providing free e mail. However there is no easy way to add advertising to e mail. In addition general e mail advertising is often considered spam.

One attempt to solve these problems is Gmail provided by Google. Gmail includes a web interface that displays e mail. Electronic advertising is displayed on the web interface that corresponds in part to content of the e mail.

Another problem is that users change e mail addresses frequently since there are many free and paid e mail services available. There is huge number of e mails sent to invalid or unavailable e mail addresses.

Another problem is that wearable devices such as smart watches and wearable glasses are becoming popular. Such devices require network connections.

There have been attempts to solve some of the problems associated with electronic advertising. U.S. Published Application No. 20020107730 entitled Method and apparatus for identifying customers for delivery of promotional materials that was published by Bernstein discloses a method and apparatus are provided for identifying potential customers for delivery of promotional materials. The method includes the steps of forming a customer profile by a vendor for targeting delivery of the promotional materials to potential customers identifying customers which match the customer profile within a database of a third party and forwarding promotional materials to the identified customers.

For example U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20030231754 entitled Telephone call redirection system that was published by Stein et al. discloses telephone call redirection system for misdialed telephone numbers is provided. When a caller physically and unintentionally dials one of a set of first numbers subscribed to by the system the system recognizes the number intended by the caller and provides the caller with the option of being redirected. If interested the caller dials another number offered by the system to hear of the desired intended number. 

U.S. Published Application No. 20030177063 entitled Custom data ADS that was published by Currrans et al. discloses aspects of the present invention provide methods a computer system a computer medium and an article of manufacture for generating personalized advertising to accompany information to be sent to a user. In one embodiment the method includes the steps of maintaining in memory a plurality of user profiles and a plurality of images associated with each user profile and selecting an image associated with the user. Next the image is inserted into advertising to provide personalized advertising. 

U.S. Pat. No. 5 642 407 that issued to He et al. entitled System and method for selected audio response in a telecommunications network teaches a system and method for selected audio response to a telephone call that results in an unsuccessful connection. If a condition within the set of conditions is satisfied based on attributes associated with the caller or the telephone call an action list associated with the satisfied condition is executed. The action list can comprise a selected audio response that is transmitted to the caller of the unsuccessful connection. 

However none of these attempts solve all of the problems associated with electronic advertising. Thus it is desirable to provide a method and system for improved advertising from network devices via cloud computing networks.

In accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention some of the problems associated with electronic advertising are overcome. A method and system for automated intelligent advertising on wearable devices is presented.

The wearable devices includes digital eyewear clothing jewelry watches etc. Messages sent to an invalid alphanumeric identifier e.g. WiFi addresses e mail address text message address social networking identifier etc. for a desired network service are returned including a notification that an attempt to connect to the desired network service has failed and also includes electronic advertising information that allows a network device to view and display a retrieved pre determined advertisement or the dynamically generated advertisement and make a selection input to automatically connect to another network device associated with the retrieved pre determined or dynamically advertisement to obtain additional electronic advertising information.

The communications network may include one or more gateways routers bridges switches. As is known in the art a gateway connects computer networks using different network protocols and or operating at different transmission capacities. A router receives transmitted messages and forwards them to their correct destinations over the most efficient available route. A bridge is a device that connects networks using the same communications protocols so that information can be passed from one network device to another. A switch is a device that filters and forwards packets between network segments. Switches typically operate at the data link layer and sometimes the network layer and therefore support virtually any packet protocol.

In one embodiment the target network devices and the source network devices include an advertising application with plural software modules. The advertising application further includes a cloud application . The plural target network devices may also include a plug in for a browser with plural software modules which communicates with applications and .

In one embodiment the target network devices may include a plug in for a browser with plural software modules.

The one or more target network devices and one or more server network devices may communicate with each other and other network devices with near field communications NFC and or machine to machine M2M communications.

 Near field communication NFC is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity usually no more than a few centimeters. Present and anticipated applications include contactless transactions data exchange and simplified setup of more complex communications such as Wi Fi. Communication is also possible between an NFC device and an unpowered NFC chip called a tag including radio frequency identifier RFID tags.

NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats and are based on existing radio frequency identification RFID standards including ISO IEC 14443 and FeliCa. These standards include ISO IEC 1809 and those defined by the NFC Forum all of which are incorporated by reference.

 Machine to machine M2M refers to technologies that allow both wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same ability. M2M uses a device to capture an event such as option purchase etc. which is relayed through a network wireless wired cloud etc. to an application software program that translates the captured event into meaningful information. Such communication was originally accomplished by having a remote network of machines relay information back to a central hub for analysis which would then be rerouted into a system like a personal computer.

However modern M2M communication has expanded beyond a one to one connection and changed into a system of networks that transmits data many to one and many to many to plural different types of devices and appliances. The expansion of IP networks across the world has made it far easier for M2M communication to take place and has lessened the amount of power and time necessary for information to be communicated between machines.

An IM is typically a short textual message. Examples of IM messages include America Online s Instant AIM messaging service Microsoft Network MSN Messenger Yahoo Messenger and Lycos ICQ Instant Messenger IM services provided by telecom providers such as T Mobile Verizon Sprint and others that provide IM services via the Internet and other wired and wireless communications networks. In one embodiment of the present invention the IM protocols used meet the requirements of Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Request For Comments RFC 2779 entitled Instant Messaging Presence Protocol Requirements. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other IM protocols not compliant with IETF RFC 2779 may also be used.

Devices and interfaces of the present invention include plural security and or encryption methods for secure communications via the computer network . Wireless Encryption Protocol WEP also called Wired Equivalent Privacy is a security protocol for WiLANs defined in the IEEE 802.11b standard. WEP is cryptographic privacy algorithm based on the Rivest Cipher 4 RC4 encryption engine used to provide confidentiality for 802.11b wireless data.

As is known in the art RC4 is cipher designed by RSA Data Security Inc. of Bedford Mass. which can accept encryption keys of arbitrary length and is essentially a pseudo random number generator with an output of the generator being XORed with a data stream to produce encrypted data.

One problem with WEP is that it is used at the two lowest layers of the OSI model the physical layer and the data link layer therefore it does not offer end to end security. One another problem with WEP is that its encryption keys are static rather than dynamic. To update WEP encryption keys an individual has to manually update a WEP key. WEP also typically uses 40 bit static keys for encryption and thus provides weak encryption making a WEP device a target of hackers.

The IEEE 802.11 Working Group is working on a security upgrade for the 802.11 standard called 802.11i. This supplemental draft standard is intended to improve WiLAN security. It describes the encrypted transmission of data between systems 802.11X WiLANs. It also defines new encryption key protocols including the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol TKIP . The IEEE 802.11i draft standard version 4 completed Jun. 6 2003 is incorporated herein by reference.

The 802.11i is based on 802.1x port based authentication for user and device authentication. The 802.11i standard includes two main developments Wireless or Wi Fi Protected Access WPA and Robust Security Network RSN .

WPA uses the same RC4 underlying encryption algorithm as WEP. However WPA uses TKIP to improve security of keys used with WEP. WPA keys are derived and rotated more often than WEP keys and thus provide additional security. WPA also adds a message integrity check function to prevent packet forgeries.

RSN uses dynamic negotiation of authentication and selectable encryption algorithms between wireless access points and wireless devices. The authentication schemes proposed in the draft standard include Extensible Authentication Protocol EAP . One proposed encryption algorithm is an Advanced Encryption Standard AES encryption algorithm.

Dynamic negotiation of authentication and encryption algorithms lets RSN evolve with the state of the art in security adding algorithms to address new threats and continuing to provide the security necessary to protect information that WiLANs carry.

The NIST developed a new encryption standard the Advanced Encryption Standard AES to keep government information secure. AES is intended to be a stronger more efficient successor to Triple Data Encryption Standard 3DES .

DES is a popular symmetric key encryption method developed in 1975 and standardized by ANSI in 1981 as ANSI X.3.92 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. As is known in the art 3DES is the encrypt decrypt encrypt EDE mode of the DES cipher algorithm. 3DES is defined in the ANSI standard ANSI X9.52 1998 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. DES modes of operation are used in conjunction with the NIST Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS for data encryption FIPS 46 3 October 1999 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The NIST approved a FIPS for the AES FIPS 197. This standard specified Rijndael encryption as a FIPS approved symmetric encryption algorithm that may be used by U.S. Government organizations and others to protect sensitive information. The NIST FIPS 197 standard AES FIPS PUB 197 November 2001 is incorporated herein by reference.

The NIST approved a FIPS for U.S. Federal Government requirements for information technology products for sensitive but unclassified SBU communications. The NIST FIPS Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules FIPS PUB 140 2 May 2001 is incorporated herein by reference.

RSA is a public key encryption system which can be used both for encrypting messages and making digital signatures. The letters RSA stand for the names of the inventors Rivest Shamir and Adleman. For more information on RSA see U.S. Pat. No. 4 405 829 now expired incorporated herein by reference.

 Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed length value or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms.

Secure Hash Algorithm SHA is used for computing a secure condensed representation of a data message or a data file. When a message of any length

Message Digest 5 MD 5 takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128 bit message digest of the input. The MD5 algorithm is intended for digital signature applications where a large file must be compressed in a secure manner before being encrypted with a private secret key under a public key cryptosystem such as RSA. The IETF RFC 1321 entitled The MD5 Message Digest Algorithm is incorporated here by reference.

Providing a way to check the integrity of information transmitted over or stored in an unreliable medium such as a wireless network is a prime necessity in the world of open computing and communications. Mechanisms that provide such integrity check based on a secret key are called message authentication codes MACS . Typically message authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret key in order to validate information transmitted between these parties.

Keyed Hashing for Message Authentication Codes HMAC is a mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions. HMAC is used with any iterative cryptographic hash function e.g. MD5 SHA 1 SHA 512 etc. in combination with a secret shared key. The cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the properties of the underlying hash function. The IETF RFC 2101 entitled HMAC Keyed Hashing for Message Authentication is incorporated here by reference.

Electronic Code Book ECB is a mode of operation for a block cipher with the characteristic that each possible block of plaintext has a defined corresponding cipher text value and vice versa. In other words the same plaintext value will always result in the same cipher text value. Electronic Code Book is used when a volume of plaintext is separated into several blocks of data each of which is then encrypted independently of other blocks. The Electronic Code Book has the ability to support a separate encryption key for each block type.

Diffie and Hellman DH describe several different group methods for two parties to agree upon a shared secret in such a way that the secret will be unavailable to eavesdroppers. This secret is then converted into various types of cryptographic keys. A large number of the variants of the DH method exist including ANSI X9.42. The IETF RFC 2631 entitled Diffie Hellman Key Agreement Method is incorporated here by reference.

However the present invention is not limited to the security or encryption techniques described and other security or encryption techniques can also be used.

The HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP Secure HTTPs is a standard for encrypted communications on the World Wide Web. HTTPs is actually just HTTP over a Secure Sockets Layer SSL . For more information on HTTP see IETF RFC 2616 incorporated herein by reference.

The SSL protocol is a protocol layer which may be placed between a reliable connection oriented network layer protocol e.g. TCP IP and the application protocol layer e.g. HTTP . SSL provides for secure communication between a source and destination by allowing mutual authentication the use of digital signatures for integrity and encryption for privacy.

The SSL protocol is designed to support a range of choices for specific security methods used for cryptography message digests and digistal signatures. The security method are negotiated between the source and destingation at the start of establishing a protocol session. The SSL 2.0 protocol specification by Kipp E.B. Hickman 1995 is incorporated herein by reference.

As is known in the art Transport Layer Security TLS provides communications privacy over the Internet. The protocol allows client server applications to communicate over a transport layer e.g. TCP in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping tampering or message forgery. For more information on TLS see IETF RFC 2246 incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment a first advertisement e.g. electronic text etc. may be sent to a first type of target network device e.g. non smart phone and a second type of advertisement e.g. multi media etc. may be sent to a second type of target network device e.g. smart phone tablet computer etc. etc. with different and or advanced capabilities.

For example a target network device and or wearable network device may request advertising at lunch time and an advertisement may be generated dynamically that includes a lunch special. The dynamic advertisement may only be generated for a certain time e.g. for lunch time hours between 11 am and 2 pm etc. a certain day e.g. Tuesdays only because Tuesdays are the slowest days for lunch time purchases etc. a certain location e.g. when the target device is physically within 1 mile of the restaurant because the restaurant does not deliver etc. and or payment by an advertiser e.g. Joe s Pizza pays for advertising and receives a top spot so its advertising is always sent first to any target network device requesting advertisements for any type of food and or restaurants.

The dynamic advertisements generated include but are not limited to dynamically generated voice advertisements voice and other audio advertisements video advertisements electronic text advertisements banner advertisements etc.

In one embodiment the dynamic advertisements are dynamically generated from a set of advertising parameters stored in one or more cloud storage objects each time the dynamic advertising is requested. For example a request for dynamically generated pizza advertising may include an audio message that is generated with the voice synthesizer using advertising parameters for a current advertisers who paid for a top spot for pizza restaurants. The top spot is dynamic based on time date amount of advertising fees paid etc.

In another embodiment selected components of the dynamic advertisements are stored in one ore cloud storage objects and retrieved to create the dynamic advertisements when the dynamic advertising is requested. For example a first cloud storage object may include a generic graphical image of a pizza a second may include specific advertisement information for a top pizza advertiser etc. The two are combined to dynamically great the pizza advertisement etc.

However the present invention is not limited to the pre determined and dynamically created advertisements discussed and more different and other types of advertisements can also be used to practice the invention.

In at Step the cloud advertising application on the source network device stores the categorized plural alphanumeric identifiers in a cloud storage object . The cloud storage object comprises a plural separate storage locations distributed across the cloud communications network but functions as a single storage object. A target cloud application on a target network device cannot determine which cloud source network devices on the one or more public private community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network may have stored the cloud storage object or a portion thereof thereby providing security and privacy for recording requests made by the target cloud application on the target network device .

In at Step the cloud advertising application on the source network device associates plural pre determined advertisements and plural dynamically generated advertisements stored in the cloud storage object with the plural categorized alphanumeric identifiers stored in the cloud storage object .

The pre determined advertisements and or the dynamically generated advertisements include a recorded audio video graphical e.g. banner etc. or electronic text advertisements. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and more fewer or other types of pre determined advertisements can be used to practice the invention.

At Step a target alphanumeric identifier is received on the cloud advertising application on the source network device from a target cloud application on a target network device with one or more processors via the cloud communications network . The target network device can contact the source network device from anywhere on the cloud computing network . The target alphanumeric identifier is used to connect the target network device to a desired network device and or anywhere on the cloud communications network .

The target alphanumeric identifiers include but are not limited to telephone numbers voice over Internet Protocol VoIP identifiers including but not limited to SKYPE identifiers Internet Protocol IP identifiers an instant message IM identifier a text message identifier an e mail address identifier a social network identifier a social networking hash code e.g. TWITTER hash code etc. etc. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and more fewer or other types of target alphanumeric identifiers can be used to practice the invention.

At Step the source cloud application on the source network device retrieves a pre determined advertisement and or dynamically generates an advertisement using the plural categorized alphanumeric identifiers stored in the cloud storage object based on the received target alphanumeric identifier.

For example an advertising category being queried by the target alphanumeric identifier is determined using a cloud storage object associated with the source network device . For example if a user of a target network device sent a target alphanumeric identifier by dialing 555 555 5555 on a mobile phone sent the text pizza via text message IM e mail etc. sent the social network TWITTER hash code pizza etc. and the subscriber to the alphanumeric identifier was Pizza Hut the source network device on the cloud network would categorize that number as a restaurant or more specifically a pizza restaurant or pizza delivery service and select an appropriate pre determined pizza advertisement.

As another example an advertising category being queried by the target alphanumeric identifier is determined using a cloud storage object associated with the source network device . For example if a user of a target network device sent during a designated lunch time period e.g. 11 am until 2 pm etc. a target alphanumeric identifier by dialing 555 555 5555 on a mobile phone sent the text pizza via text message IM e mail etc. sent the social network TWITTER hash code pizza etc. and the subscriber to the alphanumeric identifier was Pizza Hut the source network device on the cloud network would categorize that number as a restaurant or more specifically a pizza restaurant or pizza delivery service and select an appropriate pizza advertisement for dynamic generation. For example a voice or electronic text application is automatically generated stating You can purchase a large pizza today during lunch time until 2 00 pm for 9.95 instead of the regular price of 11.95 etc.

In at Step a secure message is sent from the cloud advertising application on the source network device to the target network device via the cloud communications network . The secure message includes electronic information that allows the target network device to make a selection input to connect to the desired network device and or or to receive and display the retrieved pre determined and or dynamically generated advertisements.

For example the secure message sent to the target device including the pre determined advertisement would be immediately displayed on the target device . The pre determined advertisement might include a recorded voice announcement text message IM message or e mail message including Looking to order a pizza tonight Domino s Pizza is offering a large pepperoni pizza delivered hot and fresh to your door for 9.99. Press text IM enter one to be connected to Domino s to take advantage of this great money saving offer or press text IM e mail enter two to complete your call as dialed to Pizza Hut. 

The secure message sent to the target device including the pre determined advertisement may also allow a user to initiate to elect to display the advertisement rather than immediately displaying the pre determined advertisement. For example in the above example the message includes Press text IM enter one to hear or read about special money saving offers on pizza. Press two to connect your original request. 

At Step the cloud advertising application on the source network device stores in the cloud storage object a record of any pre determined advertisements or dynamically generated advertisements retrieved or displayed by the target network device thereby providing a synchronization of retrieved and or dynamically generated displayed advertisements across all network devices and across all logins for the owner of the target network device so the retrieved and or dynamically displayed advertisements are or are not re displayed on any other network devices or any other logins anywhere on any such other network devices or logins are used anywhere on the cloud computing network.

For example if a user of a first target network device retrieved and displayed a pizza advertisement and at pizza for lunch the user may desire not to see the advertisement again and the pizza advertisement would not be displayed on any other network devices and or owned by the user.

However if a user of the first target network device retrieved and display an advertisement for an upcoming concert and wanted to see the advertisement again the advertisement would be synchronized across all the user s network devices and or across all of the user s logins.

In one embodiment a user of a target network device is able to statically e.g. with a profile digital cookie etc. set static synchronizations preferences for allowing or not allowing re display of viewed advertising that will be followed when the advertising is retrieved and or dynamically generated.

In another embodiment a user of a target network device is able to dynamically select with dynamic synchronization preferences whether viewed advertising is re displayed or not on other network devices and or other logins and synchronized on cloud computing network. For example the advertising may include a selection input to request synchronization across all network devices and or logins across the cloud computing network etc. and or the cloud advertising application may display a selection input in addition to the displayed and or dynamically generated advertising to request synchronization etc.

The synchronization of all advertising across network devices and or logins used on anywhere on the cloud computing network is dynamically configurable via the cloud advertising application on a server network device and or a corresponding cloud advertising application on a target network device .

In addition synchronization of only selected ones of advertising across network devices and or logins used on anywhere on the cloud computing network is dynamically configuration via the cloud advertising application on a server network device and or a corresponding cloud advertising application on a target network device .

However the present invention is not limited to the embodiments discussed and more different and other types of embodiments can also be used to practice the invention.

With the method and system described herein a cloud computing service is provided to process alphanumeric identifiers e.g. telephone number voice over Internet Protocol VoIP identifier Internet Protocol IP identifier an instant message IM identifier a text message identifier an e mail address identifier a social networking identifier a social networking hash code login identifiers etc. and used to categorize and associate pre determined advertising and dynamically generated advertising with the alphanumeric identifiers. When the alphanumeric identifier is received anywhere on a cloud computing network the pre determined advertising associated with the alphanumeric identifier is sent to a target device. The cloud computing service keeps display or non display of advertising in sync across all devices and all alphanumeric identifiers owned by a user of the target device.

Huge numbers of requests for desired network services such as e mail text messaging social networking fail each minute of each day. The providers of the desired network services must and do handle such routine failures. It is desirable to provide method for the providers or such desired network services to attempt collect additional revenues from advertisers during the course of handling such routine failures.

Method is illustrated with one exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can also be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment at Step a message with a target alphanumeric identifier for a desired network service is received on a cloud advertising application on a cloud server network device with one or more processors from a target cloud application on a target network device with one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising one or more public communication networks one or more private networks one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks .

For example the target alphanumeric identifier is an e mail text social networking identifier for an e mail service text messaging service social networking service etc.

At Step the cloud advertising application on the cloud server network device determines whether the received target alphanumeric identifier is valid and allows a connection to the desired network service. For example the received message may be an electronic mail message and the received target alphanumeric identifier may be an e mail address that is no longer valid or for an e mail account that is inactive deleted etc.

If the received target alphanumeric identifier is not valid at Step the cloud advertising application on the cloud server network device retrieves a pre determined advertisement or dynamically generates an advertisement stored in a cloud storage object based on the received target alphanumeric identifier.

In one embodiment the received message is parsed to identify one or more keywords e.g. keywords in an e mail message text message etc. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 720 828 by the same inventor previously incorporated by reference .

In one embodiment the keywords are parsed using a list of keywords stored in database . However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other embodiments can also be used to practice the invention

The identified one or more keywords are submitted as a query to a database . The database includes one or more electronic links for electronic information suppliers who have pre determined agreement to provide electronic links. For example the database includes electronic links to x different travel ticket booking web sites. The travel ticket booking web sites have paid a fee to allow their electronic links to be provided and inserted into e mail message that flow through an e mail server any time an e mail message includes the keyword travel and is sent to an invalid e mail address

In one embodiment the electronic links are provided in a pre determined priority order. An identified keyword of hotel is used. For example a first hotel room booking web site pays a largest fee to have its electronic link provided first for every database query for a pre determined time period. Second and subsequent hotel room booking web sites pay smaller fees to have their electronic links provided after the first hotel room booking web site.

In another embodiment a first hotel room booking web site s electronic link may be added to every instance of the identified keyword hotel by paying a largest advertising fee. In another embodiment the first hotel room booking web site s electronic link may be added to a first instance of the identified keyword hotel a second hotel room booking web site may be added to a second occurrence of the identified keyword hotel etc. since the second hotel room booking web site paid a smaller advertising fee. In another embodiment the first hotel room booking web site may pay for a pre determined number of identified keyword occurrences e.g. the first five occurrences in every e mail the first occurrence in every other e mail etc. .

In another embodiment the electronic links are provided in a random order. In another embodiment the electronic links are provided in a pre determined order e.g. a round robin order a pre determined pattern repeating order etc. for a fixed advertising ee.

In another embodiment the database queries may also further include one or more queries to one or more search engines. In such an embodiment the database query results may include a combination of electronic links from both the database and the search engine query results. In such an embodiment the search engine queries may be used to update out of date or broken electronic link stored in the database .

In another embodiment an identified keyword may be mapped into plural related keywords e.g. car rental Hertz Avis Alamo Dollar etc. . Plural identified keywords may be mapped back into one keyword e.g. Hertz Avis Alamo etc. car rental .

In another embodiment database or search engine query results are integrated into a return message as a search electronic link i.e. an electronic link that triggers a new search that is viewed by a user to allow the user to be able to do searches right from the return messages by selecting an electronic link with the search terms embedded in the electronic link. In another embodiment the return message may include an electronic link to audio video and or other multi media or text advertising purchased by one or more advertisers.

In another embodiment an electronic link for Hotels may include a static search engine query e.g. google.com search biw 968 h1 en q hotels . Such an electronic link will provide a search engine query e.g. on Google when the electronic link is selected in the electronic information message.

The cloud storage object comprises plural separate storage locations distributed across the cloud communications network but functions as a single storage object. The target cloud application on the target network device cannot determine which cloud server network devices on the one or more public private community or hybrid networks on the cloud communications network may have stored the cloud storage object or a portion thereof.

At Step a return message is sent from the cloud advertisement application on the cloud server network device to the target cloud application on target network device via the cloud communications network . The return message includes a notification that an attempt to connect to the desired network services has failed and also includes electronic advertising information that allows the target cloud application on the target network device to view display the retrieved pre determined advertisement or the dynamically generated advertisement and or make a selection input to automatically connect to another network device associated with the retrieved pre determined or dynamically advertisement to obtain additional electronic advertising information.

Method allows providers of desired network services such as e mail text messaging social networking etc. to attempt to gain advertising revenue from messages sent to invalid alphanumeric identifiers for such desired network services.

Messages sent to an invalid alphanumeric identifier e.g. e mail address text message address social networking identifier etc. for a desired network service e.g. e mail text messaging social networking etc. are returned including a notification that an attempt to connect to the desired network service has failed and also includes electronic advertising information that allows a network device to view and display a retrieved pre determined advertisement or the dynamically generated advertisement and make a selection input to automatically connect to another network device associated with the retrieved pre determined or dynamically advertisement to obtain additional electronic advertising information.

 Wearable technology and or wearable devices are clothing and accessories incorporating computer and advanced electronic technologies. Wearable devices provide several advantages including but not limited to 1 Quicker access to notifications. Important and or summary notifications are sent to alert a user to view the whole message. 2 Heads up information. Digital eye wear allows users to display relevant information like directions without having to constantly glance down 3 Always on Searches. Wearable devices provide always on hands free searches and 4 Recorded data and feedback. Wearable devices take telemetric data recordings and providing useful feedback for users for exercise health fitness etc. activities.

In one embodiment the wearable devices also include an advertising application with plural software modules. The advertising application further includes a cloud application . The plural wearable devices may also include a plug in for a browser with plural software modules which communicates with applications and . The multiple software modules may be implemented in firmware hardware or any combination thereof. In one embodiment the plural wearable devices may include a plug in for a browser with plural software modules. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiments and more fewer and other types of wearable devices can also be used to practice the invention.

Method is illustrated with one exemplary embodiment. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other embodiments can also be used to practice the invention.

In such an exemplary embodiment in at Step a message is received for a target alphanumeric identifier on a cloud advertising application on a cloud server network device with one or more processors from a wearable application on a wearable network device with one or more processors via a cloud communications network comprising one or more public communication networks one or more private networks one or more community networks and one or more hybrid networks .

The wearable network device is wearable on a person or an animal wherein the wearable network device can contact the cloud server network device from anywhere on the cloud computing network . Target alphanumeric identifier is used to connect the wearable network device to a desired network device anywhere on the cloud communications network .

At Step a test is conducted to on the cloud advertising application on the cloud server network device whether the received target alphanumeric identifier is valid and allows a connection to the desired network service.

As was discussed earlier valid alphanumeric identifiers includes those alphanumeric identifiers that are currently valid and connectable. Invalid alphanumeric identifiers include those that are not valid and not connectable due to discontinuation of a network device and or a service to a network device and or a disabling or an old or obsolete network device etc.

Connectable alphanumeric identifiers include those to which a device can be immediately connected to. Un connectable alphanumeric identifiers include those to which a device cannot be immediately connected to e.g. the device is off its battery has expired it is out range to communicate with a communication network etc. .

In one embodiment valid connectable alphanumeric identifiers include but are not limited to telephone numbers voice over Internet Protocol VoIP identifiers including but not limited to SKYPE identifiers Internet Protocol IP identifiers an instant message IM identifier a WiFi network identifier a text message identifier an e mail address identifier a social network identifier a social networking hash code e.g. TWITTER hash code etc. etc. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and more fewer or other types of alphanumeric identifiers can be used to practice the invention.

If the received target alphanumeric identifier is not valid then at Step the cloud advertising application on the cloud server network device retrieves a pre determined advertisement or dynamically generating an advertisement stored in a cloud storage object based on the received target alphanumeric identifier.

For example if the received target network identifier was for a WiFi network identifier for a coffee shop but the coffee shop s WiFi network was offline the target alphanumeric identifier would be marked as not valid.

At Step a return message is sent from the cloud advertisement application on the cloud server network device to the wearable application on wearable network device via the cloud communications network . The return message includes a notification that an attempt to connect to the desired network services has failed and also includes electronic advertising information that allows the wearable application on the wearable network device to view display the retrieved pre determined advertisement or the dynamically generated advertisement and make a selection input to automatically connect to another network device associated with the retrieved pre determined or dynamically advertisement to obtain additional electronic advertising information.

For example if the user of the wearable network device was trying to connect to a WiFi network at STARBUCKS at Step the retrieved or generated advertising may include locations of other STARBUCKS and or other coffee shops e.g. DUCAN DONUTS MCDONALDS etc. in close geographical proximity to a current physical location of the wearable network device .

If the received target alphanumeric identifier is valid then in at Step the cloud advertising application on the cloud server network device retrieves a pre determined advertisement or dynamically generating an advertisement stored in a cloud storage object based on the received target alphanumeric identifier.

At Step the retrieved pre determined advertisement or dynamically generated advertisement is sent from the cloud advertisement application on the cloud server network device to the wearable application on wearable network device via the cloud communications network .

The methods and system described herein provide advertising to wearable devices with cloud computing. However the present invention is not limited to cloud computing environments and the invention can also be practiced in a non cloud computing environment. For example the cloud storage objects can be replaced with non transitory computer readable mediums and the cloud computing network can be replaced with a non cloud network e.g. LAN WLAN Internet intranet PSTN etc. etc.

The methods and system described herein provide advertising to wearable devices with cloud computing. Messages sent to an invalid alphanumeric identifier e.g. WiFi addresses e mail address text message address social networking identifier etc. for a desired network service are returned including a notification that an attempt to connect to the desired network service has failed and or succeeded and also includes electronic advertising information that allows a network device to view and display a retrieved pre determined advertisement or the dynamically generated advertisement and make a selection input to automatically connect to another network device associated with the retrieved pre determined or dynamically advertisement to obtain additional electronic advertising information.
