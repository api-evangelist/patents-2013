The present invention relates to a user authenticating technique and more particularly to a user authenticating method which is simple and capable of strengthening security and a user authenticating server and a mobile terminal performing the same.

When a user accesses a network service user authentication is performed to verify that the user is a corresponding service subscriber to be entitled to the use of the network service and here user authentication may be performed as the user inputs an ID or a password or logs in through a certificate.

In this case however any one although he is not a service subscriber may access a network service by simply inputting personal information. So when personal information of a user is leaked due to hacking or the like damage to the user may not be prevented if someone else intentionally accesses the network service with the user s personal information. Prior art patent documents mentioned above provide various techniques for preventing such damage.

Korean Patent Laid Open Publication No. 10 2011 0049196 relates to a technique for preventing hacking by allowing a user to input personal information through an action guard flash.

Korean Patent Laid Open Publication No. 10 2009 0036813 relates to a technique for preventing hacking of input data of a virtual keyboard by using mouse input coordinate values.
