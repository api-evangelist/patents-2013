title: Systems and methods for automatically providing whois service to top level domains
abstract: Methods and systems are disclosed for quickly providing Whois services to a new top level domain after it is provisioned in a registry. In one embodiment, domain data is received at a first system regarding a top level domain (TLD). The domain data is assigned an authoritative port of a Whois server and is provisioned in a registry database. In certain embodiments, the Whois server provides information relating to domain name registrations of the TLD in the database, according to the authoritative port. The Whois server determines that a Whois query is received at the authoritative port for the queried TLD and responds with the queried information. To the requester, the responses appear as if they are sent from a unique Whois server for each TLD, but the Whois server is actually shared among the TLDs.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 539 111 filed Jun. 29 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to the field of domain name registrations and more particularly to systems and methods for automatically providing a Whois service for newly created generic top level domains TLDs .

The Domain Name System DNS allows people using the Internet to refer to domain names rather than Internet Protocol IP addresses when accessing websites and other online services. Domain names which employ text characters such as letters numbers and hyphens e.g. www.example.com will often be easier to remember than IP addresses which are numerical and do not contain letters or hyphens e.g. 128.1.0.0 . The DNS is the Internet s hierarchical lookup service for mapping character based domain names meaningful to humans into numerical IP addresses.

Domains exist at various different levels within the DNS hierarchy. For example a generic top level domain gTLD such as .COM or .NET is a domain at the highest level in the DNS hierarchy. Another type of TLD is a country code top level domain ccTLD such as for example .UK. A second level domain SLD is a subdomain of a TLD including gTLD and ccTLD which is directly below the TLD in the DNS hierarchy. For example .COM is the TLD and EXAMPLE is the SLD for the domain name www.example.com. 

Registries manage the domain names of each TLD. For example Verisign is a well known registry and it manages the .COM and .NET TLDs. To maintain a domain name in accordance with current regulations mandated by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN the registry responsible for a TLD is required to maintain a certain minimum amount of information associated with the domain name to ensure proper identification security features and operability associated with the domain name. For example all domain registrants are required to make available to the registry or the registrar their current administrative contact information. Also in order for a domain name to work correctly the registry must have nameserver information for the domain name to load into the registry s TLD DNS system to refer outside DNS requests to the proper authoritative DNS servers. Other information could include the registrar through which the domain name s registration took place the registration date the expiration date and the status of the domain name.

Domain name registration is the process by which a registrant typically an individual user or an organization can reserve or lease the use of a domain name for a specified period of time from the date of registration. The registrant may reserve the domain name for at least one year but may reserve the domain name for up to ten years. Domain names are reserved through domain registrars. Registrars are entities having business relationships with domain registries which control the domain names and maintain a domain name database for a particular TLD. Thus a registrar provides the interface by which a registrant can reserve or lease a domain name from a registry. The registry manages the reserved names and available names for a particular TLD and makes available certain information to the registrar through the Extensible Provisioning Protocol EPP . Registrars that are authorized by the registry have the ability to make reservations and check the status of domain names through the EPP. The registry provides the EPP as a communications gateway to Registrars for such purposes.

In a typical domain name registration example a registrant may want to reserve the domain name example.com. The registrant would contact a registrar that has a business relationship with the registry that operates the .COM TLD. For example the company GoDaddy is a known registrar and the company Verisign is a known registry. The registrant would query the registrar as to the availability of the domain name example in the .COM namespace. The registrar in turn would query the proper Registry for the .COM TLD through the EPP and then return the results to the registrant. The Registrant may then obtain a registration of the domain name by paying a registration fee and providing information required by the registry and registrar. The registry charges the registrar for the domain name registration and the registrar collects the registration fee from the registrant.

In addition to the traditional TLDs e.g. .COM and .NET the domain name system and domain name registration system have also evolved to allow the use of new generic TLDs gTLDs which may be applied for from the regulatory body pertaining to registries and registrars the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN . Some of these gTLDs are often referred to as vanity or brand domains such as .MICROSOFT or .COCACOLA. ICANN also allows for community based TLDs such as .BANK or .HOTEL and geographic TLDs such as .AFRICA. Other TLDs may be contemplated by ICANN.

The creation and administration of a new TLD requires several changes to be made at a registry at one or more registrars and at a variety of other services such as Whois. The Whois server typically stores and provides domain registration information such as registration date expiration date status and owner of the registered domain names. The Whois server provides a service that can be queried by users via for example a website on the Internet provided by a registrar or registry or via standard Telnet like clients. With ICANN s new gTLD program for new gTLDs hundreds of new gTLDS are expected to be created over the next few years. Registries for the new gTLDs must provide Whois services for all of them. However creating a separate Whois service for each new gTLD is cost prohibitive and does not scale.

Thus there exists a need in the art to automatically provide a Whois service upon the creation and provisioning of a new TLD with minimal manual intervention from registry administrative users.

In accordance with an embodiment a method for establishing a top level domain may be provided. The method may comprise receiving domain data related to a top level domain TLD at a first computer system. The domain data may be assigned a network address of a second computer system. The domain data may be transmitted to the second computer system. The domain data may be stored in a database of the second computer system. In another embodiment a system for establishing a top level domain may be provided.

In another embodiment a method for processing a Whois query may be provided. The method may comprise receiving a query at a first network address of a server. The query may include a request for an object relating to a domain name in a TLD. The method may also comprise determining a preassigned network address that corresponds to the TLD. The preassigned network address may be compared to the first network address of the server. The object may be searched for in a database.

In other embodiments the method may include verifying that the first network address corresponds to the preassigned network address. The method may also comprise returning a response to the query containing the object.

Additional aspects related to the embodiments will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to the disclosed embodiments certain examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed embodiments can be modified in various respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure. Accordingly the drawings and descriptions are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive. Wherever convenient the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

Registry may be an entity that manages a new TLD. Registry may include infrastructure to define and provision new TLDs including for example computer components e.g. servers processors memory devices storing software instructions that when executed by processor s execute provisioning related processes communication components and the like . Registry may include one or more processors and memory devices memory storing software instructions that when executed by processors perform one or more operations consistent with the disclosed embodiments. Registry may include an interface module such as a graphical user interface to allow registry to manage TLDs.

Whois server may provide a service accessible by registry for responding to Whois queries. Whois server may be one or more computers configured to receive requests for information over a network e.g. Internet and provide information to components over the network. For example in one embodiment Whois server may include one or more computer or data processing devices that have hardware e.g. processors storage memory data buses network interface etc. and or software e.g. application programs operating systems other executable program code written in any known programming languages . Whois server may include one or more processors and memory devices memory storing software instructions that when executed by processors perform one or more operations consistent with the disclosed embodiments. Whois server may include an interface module such as a web interface to allow registry user or third party to query for information relating to the TLDs that Whois server serves. Interface module may also include a password protected web interface that would restrict querying Whois server to individuals or entities with valid identification information as discussed below for . Whois server may also store a list of pre authorized sources for restricting queries to the Whois service as discussed below for . Whois server may also include one or more databases for storing information relating to TLDs.

In one embodiment Whois server may be associated with registry . For example Whois server may be associated with a Whois service provider that provides the service for registry . In another embodiment Whois service may be part of registry . In other embodiments Whois server may provide Whois services for multiple entities that manage TLDs including registry and third party . For example third party may be a corporation partnership company or other business entity that manages a new gTLD such as .MICROSOFT.

User may be an individual accessing Whois server via for example a website on the Internet or via Whois server s interface . Alternatively user may be a registrar or other corporation partnership company government agency municipality or other forms of business or government entities that accesses Whois server .

System or one or more components of system may be configured to execute processes that provide Whois services relating to TLDs defined and provisioned by registry .

The table further illustrates that each TLD may be associated with a network address. In one embodiment the network address may include IP addresses 10.175.151.114 for .IBM and .MICROSOFT and 10.175.151.115 for .AFRICA. Other network address protocols may be used such as HTTP.

Thus in the example of if Whois server receives a query for example.africa it may not provide to user a response that includes contact information regarding the registrant. If Whois server however receives a query for example.ibm or example.microsoft it may provide the registrant s contact information to user because .IBM and .MICROSOFT may allow Whois server to publically share personal contact information. In other embodiments Whois server may act as a premium Whois service and may provide contact information if user has valid identification information using a password protected web interface or is a preauthorized source as discussed below as to .

In step registry may provision the TLD in one or more registry databases . In one embodiment provisioning may include at least setting up a DNS service and the Whois service for the TLD. Setting up the Whois service may include assigning a default port of Whois server to the TLD such as port . Thus a TLD may be provisioned without being assigned an authoritative port. In other embodiments provisioning may include at least adding the TLD to one or more registry databases and allowing registrars to transact with registry for that TLD. For example registry may have multiple databases supporting multiple TLDs. In one embodiment registry may have three databases one supporting gTLDs one supporting ccTLDs and one supporting vanity TLDs. Each database may support more than one TLD. In other embodiments third party may provision the TLD in one or more databases .

In step Whois server may acquire data regarding the TLD from registry database or third party database and store it in database of Whois server . For example Whois server may extract the TLD its authoritative port and its network address and use that information to populate database . In one embodiment Whois server may replicate the data in registry database in database . For example Whois server may copy the data stored in the table in from registry database to database . In other embodiments registry or third party may push data to database of Whois server .

In step Whois server may begin to serve the new gTLD with the Whois service. For example in step Whois server processes queries received for domain name registrations of the new gTLD according to the methods described below .

In step Whois server may compare the port receiving the query e.g. to the authoritative port e.g. . Whois server may determine whether the two ports match in step . If they do not match Whois server may reject the query in step . Rejecting the query may include sending a response to user indicating that the query is rejected. For example the response may include a message such as No Match Found even though the queried information may exist in database .

If the ports do match Whois server may search database for the queried information step . For example if user queried for example.microsoft at port in step Whois server may search for the queried information in database . For example user may request and Whois server may search for objects relating to the queried TLD such as the domain name the nameserver the registrar the registration date the expiration date and the status of the domain name. Whois server may also search for other objects such as registrant s personal contact information.

In step Whois server may return the objects of the query to user . In one embodiment Whois server may return objects associated only with the authoritative TLD. For example if user queries for the registration date of example.microsoft at port Whois server may return information relating only to the .MICROSOFT TLD. In contrast if user queries for the registration date of example.microsoft at port Whois server may not return any information regarding the .MICROSOFT TLD step .

In other embodiments the objects returned in the response may depend on whether Whois server is allowed to disclose personal contact information for the queried TLD. For example as illustrated in Whois server may be allowed to publically disclose personal contact information of registrants of the .MICROSOFT TLD. As a result in if user queried Whois server for the name and address of the registrant of example.microsoft Whois server may provide step a response to user with the requested objects i.e. the registrant s name and address . If however user queried Whois server for the name and address of the registrant of example.africa Whois server may not provide the requested objects in a response to user . Whois server may however return other objects in response to user s query regarding example.africa such as the nameserver the registrar the registration date the expiration date and the status of the domain name.

If the information is current in step Whois server may end the process. If the information is not current in step Whois server may determine that the data in database needs to be updated. In one embodiment Whois server may update database with the current information. For example Whois server may update the port mapping of a particular TLD if the authoritative port has changed. In other embodiments Whois server may update database with information stored in other databases such as registry database . For example Whois server may determine that registry has assigned a new authoritative port port to the .MICROSOFT TLD instead of port . In this example Whois server may update its port mappings in database to reflect that .MICROSOFT is now served by port . Whois server may then end the accuracy check process in step .

In step Whois server may receive a Whois query from user whose user credentials have been authenticated. In step Whois server may return to user the requested sensitive information.

It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.
