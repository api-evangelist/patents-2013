This application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 610 972 filed on Sep. 12 2012 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 474 450 filed on May 29 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 346 577. The contents of each of the foregoing are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The present invention relates generally to computer based methods and apparatuses including computer program products for automation of auditing claims.

Insurance claim estimates can be written by a number of different appraisal types e.g. independent appraisers repair shop appraisers insurance staff appraisers . The appraiser can select the tools and or materials used to generate the estimates e.g. how to write estimates what software to use to write the estimates what forms to use etc. . The completed estimates are sent to the appropriate insurance company for review approval and payment.

Completed estimates are reviewed to determine accuracy prior to approval and settlement of costs. The review includes in part determining liability for the claim costs. Liability either rests with the reviewing insurance company a different insurance company or a third party. When the liability rests with an insurance company other than the reviewing insurance company or with a third party all estimate repair documents are imaged and mailed or emailed to the liable party.

The review and settlement process for claim estimates is fundamentally consistent regardless of the claim type e.g. a claim for a vehicle repair a subrogation claim a glass claim a medical claim a property claim or other claim type . As such the documents used in the processes for review and settlement of a claim are also materially similar. Some claim documents can be received electronically while most documents used in a review are imaged making it technically impossible today to automate the review approval and or payment process for claims.

It is estimated that on average claim costs for insurers are inflated by over 20 on each claim or approximately 2.0 billion per year. To exert some control over the quality of repair operations and the accuracy of repair expenditures and claim costs insurance companies perform audits on the repair documents and repair work associated with an insurance claim. Similarly other businesses such as glass companies salvage pool businesses rental car companies and others perform the same or similar auditing of documents to control quality of work performed and costs expended.

For claims undergoing an audit process auditors manually analyze parts selected manually analyze repair operations suggested performed and manually perform other proprietary business procedures and guidelines that are designed by the insurer to provide the best end result for the vehicle owner and the business. Only limited capabilities exist in electronic auditing of estimate line items which are limited to single line Yes No outputs that are completely reliant upon an underlying code being associated with a data element on a specific line item of an estimate. There may not be a code for each line item. For example if an appraisal source modifies an estimate line manually from the pre defined input of the estimating software those codes no longer exist. Because this occurs on almost all claim estimates the current electronic auditing tools can be more appropriately characterized as tools that flag possible issues for auditors. The audit itself must still be completed manually. The cost and inefficiencies around this type of process enable only a minority of all claims to be reviewed for quality and accurateness.

The primary factors that affect claims cost are 1 the parts being utilized on the repair estimate and 2 the repair operation being listed as necessary. From these two key estimate elements other costs are either incurred or avoided. Insurance companies can reduce repair costs by having appraisers substitute higher priced original equipment parts from original equipment manufacturers OEM s with less expensive equivalent aftermarket recycled or reconditioned parts alternative parts . Advantageously by using alternative parts appraisers and repair shops save actual repair time improve the quality of parts used in the repair and accelerate the time taken to repair a vehicle. The end result is advantageous for all parties involved in the process.

For example a claims appraiser to save time and simplify the writing of a repair estimate often selects higher priced OEM parts on a repair estimate claiming no availability of approved alternative parts. Similarly a repair shop can receive payment for an OEM part from an insurance company and actually use a lower quality less expensive non approved part without the insurance company having an accurate and reliable process to verify proper part utilization. Similarly a repairer or appraiser may add repair operations onto an estimate that are not needed based on the type of part selected. Without a manual review of the claim documents these costs and lower quality parts can go undetected and contribute to higher repair costs and insurance rate costs as well as poorer quality repairs for policyholders. Insurance claims and general repairs cannot be processed in an automatic process today because there is no system to accept claim documents and convert them into a usable electronic form. There is no system capable of deciphering or translating line items on the claim and repair documents to review accuracy and best practices. There is no system capable of reviewing and comparing various data across the documents to ensure adherence to the insurers best practices and guidelines for repairs.

For example the subrogation of insurance claims is an extremely manual and paper based process. Assume driver A is insured by company A and driver B is insured by company B . Driver A is involved in an accident with driver B where A is responsible for the accident. However B can go to his insurance company B to repair his automobile insurance company B pays for the repairs and then insurance company B subrogates against driver A s insurance carrier for reimbursement. Insurance company A however will respond to insurance company B by evaluating how the vehicle was repaired and then pay only what A feels is the proper amount.

This process cannot be performed on every claim filed per year and often leads to the parties going through an arbitration process with any settlement occurring on average over five 5 months after the initial subrogation. When sizing the automotive claims repair claims and subrogation claims marketplace there are approximately 30 000 000 claims that must be reviewed approved and paid each year. Of this volume none of the claims that can be electronically and automatically reviewed or audited in a manner that constitutes an audited review. This can be problematic because the insurance company must either elect to pay the claim as received at a 100 value or to apply people to the review process which is both time consuming and expensive. The cumulative claim cost for the repair estimate only excluding rental towing people etc. is estimated at over 100 billion U.S. dollars.

The end result is a very time consuming he said she said process. As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 928 570 U.S. Pub. No. 2008 0243556 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety subrogation specialists and self insured s can gain access to real time data that supports availability of parts on historical dates enabling parties involved in the claims process to better identify when an appraiser did not accurately utilize parts on an estimate and or accurately document the cost of parts on the estimate. However subrogation specialists must still manually analyze each operational entry in the repair documents to generate a proper settlement amount.

The techniques described herein can provide one or more of the following advantages. Claims can be automatically converted from an imaged form to a digital or electronic form reducing both the time and cost required to prepare a claim for review. Electronic claims can be automatically translated and verified against rules associated with parts appropriate or approved for a specific vehicle operations allowable or needed for a specific vehicle repair and other insurance company specific guidelines implemented as part of an insurance policy or the Company s best practices. Together and separately each of these advantages reduce the time and cost required to audit the claims and collectively and or separately improve the quality of the claim settlement and repair.

Better auditing can lead to not only better cost control but also better auditing quality which in turn positively impacts vehicle values for the owners quality of repairs for the owners and insurance rates that are tied in part to expense ratios. The personnel required to review the claims are reduced the quality is improved and all claims are now able to be automatically reviewed which benefits both the consumer as well as the parties involved in the claims process. Sets of rules used to translate and verify the claims can be easily updated and modified allowing the system and apparatus to grow to meet future demands. In addition to enabling auditing across many verticals of business the automation of claims processing and auditing enabled through these techniques enables automated settlement between parties reducing the cost time and personnel burden of cash settlement between these parties.

Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings illustrating the principles of the invention by way of example only.

It should be understood that the principles described herein are not limited in application to the details of construction or the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The principles can be embodied in other embodiments and can be practiced or carried out in various ways. Also it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.

Exemplary embodiments are illustrated in the drawings. Although this specification refers primarily to auditing replacement parts used in automobile insurance claims it should be understood that the subject matter described herein is applicable to any type of insurance claim such as for example property insurance or medical insurance. It should be noted that a plurality of hardware and software based devices as well as a plurality of different structural components can be utilized to implement the invention. Furthermore and as described in subsequent paragraphs the specific configurations illustrated in the drawings are intended to exemplify embodiments of the principles described here in and that other alternative configurations are possible.

While some terms e.g. matching terms and terms in the figures and associated descriptions are described in the specification in all uppercase letters this is for exemplary purposes only and it should be understood that the terms can be represented in any combination of lowercase and uppercase letters. Similarly if terms are described in lowercase and or uppercase letters or any combination thereof the terms can be represented in any combination of lowercase and uppercase letters. Further while some embodiments are described using tables this is for exemplary purposes only and is not intended to be limiting. The number of columns and or rows depicted in tables are for exemplary purposes only. Any additional number of rows and or columns can be added to implement the principles presented below. Data can be stored in any data structure such as a table a linked list single or multi dimensional data array circular array and or any other type of data structure.

In general overview auditable items of a data file are translated into a translated item description. Each translated item description is compared to a plurality of predetermined terms to generate matching information and using the matching information each translated item description is associated with an item identifier. Each auditable item is accepted or rejected based on the item identifier and one or more rules associated with the data file.

The auditing system may be any known computing system but is preferably a programmable processor based system. For example the computer may include a microprocessor a hard drive random access memory RAM read only memory ROM input output I O circuitry and any other well known computer component. The computer is preferably adapted for use with various types of storage devices persistent and removable such as for example a portable drive magnetic storage e.g. a floppy disk solid state storage e.g. a flash memory card optical storage e.g. a compact disc or CD and or network Internet storage. The computer may comprise one or more computers including for example a personal computer e.g. an IBM PC compatible computer or a workstation e.g. a SUN or Silicon Graphics workstation operating under a Windows MS DOS UNIX or other suitable operating system and preferably includes a graphical user interface GUI .

Output unit can include applications that use identifiers e.g. generated by the make model translator the insurance company name translator the parts translator and or the operational audit rules engine to generate various types of reports. Output unit includes a parts auditing application A an operational ops auditing application B and a multi point auditing application C collectively report applications . The output unit can include need not include all of the auditing applications . In some examples the multi point auditing application C uses the output from the parts auditing application A and the ops auditing application B to generate a multi point audit report. The operation of these applications is described with reference to the figures below.

The control input unit is in communication with the auditing system . The control input unit is used to transmit rules guidelines standards responses actions and or other control information to the auditing system . While the parts audit rules engine is shown to include the make model translator the insurance company name translator and the parts translator the components of the parts audit rules engine can be implemented in one or more modules e.g. software programs hardware components . In some embodiments the control input unit performs an inventory parts update. For example once every pre determined time period e.g. every 24 hours the control input unit updates the inventory of parts stored in database by adding any new parts and or modifying existing parts.

The client computers transmit the data file to auditing system using for example fax mail email a web service or any other type of communication tool. The data file is entered for example manually transmitted as an electronic data file and or transmitted as an image file. If the data file is transmitted as an image file the text recognition unit can translate the image into machine editable text fields e.g. translate data file into machine editable auditable fields where the auditable fields include an associated word string for translation by translator . For example text recognition unit can perform an optical character recognition OCR of images of handwritten typewritten or printed data files e.g. captured by a scanner as a PDF file into machine editable text fields. The parts translator receives the output of the machine editable text fields from the text recognition unit . In some embodiments the auditing system receives a machine editable data file and the text recognition unit can be omitted.

The auditing system automatically generates a parts audit report based on the one or more groups of identifiers the parts audit report comprising data indicative of whether one or more parts of the one or more auditable items is accepted based on one or more rules associated with the insurance company identifier. The auditing system automatically generates an operational audit report based on the one or more groups of identifiers. The operational audit report includes data indicative of whether one or more operations of the one or more auditable items is accepted based on one or more rules associated with the insurance company identifier. The auditing system automatically generates a multi point estimate based on the parts audit report data and the operational audit report data.

With respect to step the make model translator translates the make model information into the vehicle identifier. This process is described in further detail with reference to . With respect to step the insurance company name translator translates the insurance company information into the insurance company identifier. This process is described in further detail with . With respect to step the part translator e.g. the first parts translator A the second parts translator B and or both translates one or more of the auditable items into one part item identifiers. This process is described in further detail with . The operational audit rules engine translates one or more of the auditable items into operational item identifiers e.g. repair estimate operations . This process is described in further detail with FIGS. and A C.

In an exemplary embodiment the translators e.g. the translators of the part audit rules engine and the operational audit rules engine take unstructured data e.g. from the text recognition unit and or from the data file directly and translate the outputs into identifiers recognized by the auditing system . These identifiers are processed through one 1 or a combination of three 3 audit processes e.g. the parts auditing application A the ops auditing application B and or the multi point auditing application C . Advantageously by developing multiple audit processes the processes can work independently of each other allowing an insurance company or other business to use them for specific needs. For example an insurance company may desire to have an internal claims review team use the parts auditing services of the auditing system e.g. provided through the parts auditing application A to confirm parts utilization on estimates. Or the same insurance company may want to have repair estimates reviewed for accuracy of repair operations for vehicles being repaired e.g. via the ops auditing application B . In another example an insurance company may want to have repair estimates reviewed in a completely automated process e.g. via the multi point auditing process C .

With respect to step the auditing system applies the part identifiers to a database and application e.g. the database and the parts auditing application A of to audit for best practices and compliance to insurance policy guidelines generating the parts audit report parts auditing or parts auditing services . Of single repair components parts can have a large impact on overall claim severity. The parts auditing component e.g. the parts auditing application A when used in conjunction with the other required components of the auditing system of the auditing system ensures accuracy in parts utilization on repair estimates. Parts auditing services deliver accurate parts inventory to appraisers confirm parts availability for insurance company review teams automatically approve part selections on behalf of insurers and document historical availability for subrogation reviewers.

Existing services that are known in the art can help an insurance company locate parts for use in an estimate. These services can be found online e.g. CarPart.com or can be found inside the estimating software solutions used by appraisers. The online services are manual and require an appraiser to manually enter a website and search for specific parts. The services inside an estimating software system are more automated but they only work for specific parts and also require the part to be associated with an accurate OEM number from the manufacturer. This OEM number is not always available e.g. only approximately 35 of the time and the services are further restricted by the limited number of parts that are supported.

The parts auditing component of the auditing system utilizes parts translators e.g. the first parts translator and the second parts translator B designed and developed as a means to 1 take inventory provided by part suppliers each day e.g. over 140 000 000 pieces of inventory daily and translate them so that a part identifier can be tagged on to each piece of inventory received and 2 to take estimate line item descriptions from repair estimates e.g. data file and to translate and associate those line item descriptions with a part identifier.

Once the translators translate estimated line item details for parts into a unique part identifier the auditing system can provide part alternatives by searching the database e.g. database for matching identifiers filter out inventory not approved by an insurer and or audit for compliance to specific part use guidelines of the insurer. Advantageously because the auditing system does not rely on OEM numbers or a user to manually do the search the parts auditing component can be performed on all parts listed on an estimate because the process is automatic and complete.

With respect to step the auditing system applies operational item identifiers to a database and application e.g. the database and the ops auditing application of to audit for best practices and compliance to insurance policy guidelines generating the operational audit report operational auditing or repair operation auditing . Operational auditing refers to the auditing of line items on a repair estimate e.g. data file that do not involve a physical removal of a vehicle part i.e. a hood with the replacement of a replacement part in place of the removed part. For example operational auditing includes auditing labor hours auditing repair operations e.g. recharging an AC compressor auditing labor rates for a repair operation and auditing the number of hours it takes to remove and replace a physical part but not the audit of the part itself just the operation . Once an estimate file e.g. data file is converted e.g. via text recognition unit if necessary it can be input into the automated auditing systems and in this example the operational auditing system e.g. the ops auditing application B of .

Currently operational auditing system providers are limited with capabilities. Each requires that the data is received in an electronic format the data received is associated on the same line of the estimate and the data being audited is of a pre defined value e.g. not any free text semi structured or un structured data . These limitations make operational auditing inefficient and impractical in attempting to audit all claim estimates. Less than 50 of the industry s claim estimates are available in an electronic form so insurance companies cannot rely on an automated auditing solution. Additionally because the only result from current operational auditing providers is a YES NO result for an isolated line of an estimate data the user encounters incomplete feedback from the auditing system and is required to review the materials manually to confirm.

For example assume a repair estimate is received electronically not as an image . Each line on the repair estimate identifies a repair operation that must take place during the repair of the vehicle. Assume line number fourteen 14 includes an operation code of REPAIR a line item description inserted by the appraiser of FULL FRAME a part type part number of Existing and labor units of 9.0. Current operational auditing systems can identify and understand an electronic code for REPAIR and the labor units of 9.0 but cannot interpret or understand FULL FRAME because it is a written typed description. As such current operational auditing systems can only make decisions with an electronically received formatted repair estimate and the result of such systems can only take place with respect to a single line item e.g. information from other lines can not be considered . Such operational auditing systems cannot consider parts information as it relates to an operation.

Therefore a rule that says do not allow FRAME labor to exceed 6 units would be run and line fourteen 14 would not fail because the operational auditing system would not identify the line was associated with a FRAME repair. This would cause the insurance company to incorrectly allow a repair appraiser to have increased hours on line fourteen and ultimately this gap in capability of the auditing system providers places a burden on the insurance company to manually check each estimate even after running the rules against the audit to know if the audit rule fired correctly. Advantageously by translating FULL FRAME into a corresponding operational identifier the operational auditing application B of the auditing system can properly apply operational rules eliminating the need for manual review and improper rule firing. If a repair estimate is not received electronically e.g. is received as an image without the translators e.g. the make model translator the insurance company name translator and the parts translator of the repair estimate file would need to be processed manually. As such the auditing system can automatically translate both electronic and non electronic files.

With respect to step the auditing system combines identifiers and or reports e.g. the part identifiers and the operational item identifiers and or the parts audit report and operational audit report into an auditing application that would simulate a review of an estimate as if performed by an actual person generating a multi point estimate multi point auditing . Multi point auditing enables real time fully automated review audit and approval of a claim repair estimate without human review.

Multi point auditing can be achieved because the auditing system can through it s various components identify a data set and then understand what that data set means for every field of every estimate detail regardless of whether it is a part or operational line item e.g. the translators can translate the required data into meaningful identifiers for use by the auditing system . This capability enables not only the electronic auditing of claims or other data files but it opens the road for complete automation of approval procurement and payment activities between insurers repairers and suppliers into the claims repair process.

Multi point auditing allows multiple data points across a repair estimate to be considered in whole so that a decision can be made about any specific line s accuracy or appropriateness. For example assume a data file includes multiple line items two of which are 1 line item six 6 operation CHECK ADJUST line item description HEADLAMPS and labor units 0.4 and 2 line item seven 7 operation REMOVE REPLACE line item description L FRT COMBINATION LAMP ASSEMBLY and labor units INC. Conventional auditing systems known in the art can not properly audit this line item combination for inappropriate labor operations such as aiming headlamps . In the multi point auditing process of the auditing system the translators e.g. the part translator would have associated a part identifier to the description in line seven to mark it as a headlamp being replaced. The auditing system would have kept track of such a detail from line seven e.g. via storage in database and scanned the remaining lines of the estimate to find that line six includes a labor operation that would also be translated for a headlamp. The auditing system would store that information and use rules to deduce that estimating software e.g. Mitchell Ultra Mate Estimating Software adds enough labor for replacing a headlamp line seven to include the aiming operation. The multi point auditing would therefore alert the appraiser and the insurer that line six should be deleted as the operation was included in the cost of line seven.

Advantageously repair estimates can be received processed reviewed audited and required changes if they exist can be communicated back to the appraisal source and the insurer without human intervention. Multi point auditing can be performed on all claims regardless of what format they are received electronic or imaged . Additionally the process for translating outputs of the conversion process can be applied to all types of forms. For example medical claims can be audited where billions of claims are dealt with annually and all of them are rubber stamped and paid or audited with less than trustworthy tools that require human review of the audit results after the fact. Advantageously if all claims data can be converted to digital form the ability to enable procurement real time automated settlement and many other features exists.

Below is an example of a translation process e.g. carried out by the make model translator with reference to the steps of method of . In a preferred embodiment the sequence of the steps is preserved for the make model translation. However in other examples the steps can be executed in any order and in any combination without detracting from the make model translation. For example translation steps can be added and removed as additional patterns are identified within insurance company names.

With respect to step four primary pieces of information can be used the claim block make field the claim block model field the estimate block make field and the estimate block model field. The make model translator can prepare the characters of the word strings in each of the four fields for the translation process. The preparation can include for example separating all dissimilar types of characters for processing in the claim block make and model fields and the estimate block make and model fields. In some examples all alphanumeric words and the special character may be split into two or more words by separating the alpha and numeric and special characters from each other by inserting a space between them. In some examples if both the claim block model field and the estimate block model field have numerics and if the smaller numeric is a truncated version of the larger numeric e.g. divided by 10 or 100 then the make model translator can set both numerics equal to the larger numeric e.g. if one model field has 3500 and the other model field has 35 or 350 then the make model translator sets both model fields to equal 3500 . In some examples if the claim block model field is empty and there are multiple words in the claim block make field then the make model translator can copy all but the first word from the claim block make field word string into the claim block model field.

With respect to step of the make model translator prepares the one or more model fields for translation by applying one or more rules from a plurality of rules. As illustrative examples the rules are configured to identify models in the claim block model field e.g. motorcycles that may not need to be processed find words that have been incorrectly separated and should be combined into a single word find words that have been incorrectly combined that should be separated into two words standardize spelling of descriptive classification words e.g. coupe or wagon through conversion of aliases or abbreviations and identify a passenger car model.

In some examples to identify models in the claim block model field e.g. motorcycles that may not need to be processed the make model translator is configured to search for matches of the individual words of the claim block model field word in a list or table such as an Invalid Model Table An exemplary list of the invalid terms includes for example MOTORCYCLE MOTORCYCL MOTORCYC MOTORCY MOTORC CYCLE CYCL CYC MOTOR CYCLE MOTOR CYCL MOTOR CYC MOTOR CY RG HARLEY and KAWASAKI. If a match occurs with an invalid term the make model translator can be configured to discontinue all testing of the claim and estimate block data and stop processing the claim.

The make model translator can use rules to help identify a passenger car model. One exemplary rule is if the word Somerset is in the model word string then models Regal or Regal Coupe or Regal Sedan cannot be match. Another exemplary rule is if DEL is found in a model field and Honda is the make then add SOL to the model field if it does not already exist in the field and delete all other words in that field except for DEL SOL e.g. DEL SOL is two words . Vehicle makes can be coded in this manner. For example Honda and all of its aliases can be coded into such a rule. The rule can be updated as additional aliases are uncovered.

Another exemplary rule is if Fleetwood or one of its aliases is matched as a model word and Chevrolet or one of its aliases is the make then replace the make of Chevrolet and the model field with invalid. Another exemplary rule is if BMW is the Make and the Model field begins with Z and contains the letter M remove the letter M. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field contains the word Civic and the associated model field contains the word Hybrid change the model field to Civic Hybrid and the associated make field to Honda. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field contains the word Accord and the associated model field contains the word Hybrid change the Model field to Accord Hybrid and the associated Make field to Honda. 

Another exemplary rule is a if the claim or estimate block model field contains Blazer change model field to BLAZER S 10 for following conditions model year 1995 and above or model year 1994 and below and FULLSIZE not in model field. If b the claim or estimate block model field contains Jimmy change model field to JIMMY S 15 for following conditions model year 1995 and above or model year 1994 and below and FULLSIZE not in model field. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block model field contains SL or SW and 1 or 2 and claim and estimate block model field and style field doesn t contain COUPE and style field doesn t contain SEDAN add SEDAN to style. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block model field contains the words Lesabre and Limited remove the word Limited from the associated model fields.

Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block model field contains the words Deville and Concours then remove the word Deville from the associated model fields. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block model field contains the words RANCHERO and GT the remove the word GT from the associated model fields. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field has the word Merc and the associated claim or estimate field model field contain any word that starts with any of the following letter sets BOB CAP COM COU GRA LYN MAR MET MON MOU MYS SAB TOP TRA VIL ZEP then change the associated make field to Mercury. Otherwise if there is not a match change the associated make field to Mercedes Benz .

Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field contains the word Dodge and the associated model field contains any of the following number sets 1500 2500 3500 but does not contain the word RAM in either the claim or estimate block model fields then add the word Pickup to the associated model field. Another exemplary rule is if the word DODGE and RAM found in claim or estimate block make field remove RAM from claim or estimate block make field and add RAM PICKUP to claim and estimate block model field. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block model field contains the words Mustang and GT the remove the word GT from the associated model fields. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field has the words Dodge and the associated model field has the word INTR change the associated model field to Intrepid . Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field has the words Oldsmobile and the associated model field has the word INTR change the associated model field to Intrigue .

Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field has the words Eagle and the associated model field has the words Eagle and Talon remove the word Eagle from the associated model field. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field has the words MINI and the associated model field has the word COOPER add the word MINI to the associated model field and remove the word MINI form the make field and add the word BMW to the make field. Another exemplary rule is if claim or estimate block make field contains Chevrolet or alias and claim or estimate block model field contains Prizm or alias then set the make to GEO and model to PRIZM. Another exemplary rule is if the estimate or claim block make field has the word Subaru and the associated model field has the two words GL and XT then remove the word GL from the model field.

Another exemplary rule is if the estimate or claim block make field has the word Toyota or alias and the associated model field has the word Seinna or alias change the make field to Toyota and model field to Seinna . If the estimate or claim block make field has the word Nissan or alias and the associated model field has the word Armada or alias change the make field to Nissan and the model field to Armada . Another exemplary rule is if the estimate or claim block make field has the word Infiniti or alias and the associated model field has the word QX 56 change the make field to Infiniti and model field to QX 56 . Another exemplary rule is if the estimate or claim block make field has the word BUICK or alias and the associated model field has the word Century or alias then change the make field to Buick and the model field to Century . Another exemplary rule is if the estimate or claim block model field has the word METRO or alias Change the make field to GEO and the model field to METRO .

Another exemplary rule is if the estimate or claim block make field has the word FORD or alias and the associated model field has the word PROBE or alias then change the make field to FORD and model field to PROBE . Another exemplary rule is if the estimate or claim block make field has the word MERCEDES BENZ or alias and the associated model field has the word 430 and the letter E then change the make field to MERCEDES BENZ and the model field to E CLASS .

With respect to step the make model translator can for example identify and flag vehicle makes for different reports determine if the model is a truck and use rules to determine what the truck is. is an exemplary table for use when identifying recreational vehicles. Column is labeled Invalid Make Table and contains various listings of recreational vehicles. The make model translator can identify and flag makes that are recreational vehicles RVs for special reports but standard processing. The special report can be at the end of the processing to send an email. The make model translator runs all claim and estimate block make fields through column . If a match is found e.g. either the first word or one of its aliases which are listed as subsequent words in rows that contain more than one word and it is the only word in the make field then the make model translator can flag the claim as RV and place the make name in the RV make field delete the matched word in the claim or estimate block make field and continue to process on the other claim or estimate block field information. The RV field and RV Make fields are new fields that can be added to the table in the audit record.

Second if there is a numeric in either the claim block model field or the estimate block model field but not both then the make model translator adds the numeric to the field that does not have a numeric. Third if there are no numerics in the claim and estimate block model fields but a truck name was identified in one of the model fields then the make model translator can add the truck name matched to the claim or estimate block model field that did not have the match. Lastly the make model translator deletes all other words in the claim and estimate block model fields word strings besides the truck name matched and the numeric. These steps are for exemplary purposes and are not intended to be limiting.

The make model translator can use one or more rules to clarify what particular truck the claim data file involves. One exemplary rule is if PICKUP or one of its aliases is in a model field and is the only word in the model field delete the word PICKUP unless the make is ISUZU JEEP MAZDA MERCEDES BENZ MITSUBISHI NISSAN or TOYOTA or an alias of one of the vehicle makes . is a diagram of an exemplary table for use when determining an alias. Table includes two columns column labeled Make Alias Word and column labeled Make Alias Word each of which includes aliases for which the first term in the list of terms for a row represents the base word e.g. ISUZU for the first data row is the base word and Isuz ISU ISZU and ISZ are alias words .

Another exemplary rule is if E precedes any numbers and Ford is the make or manufacturer add the word Van to the claim and estimate block model names unless it causes duplication. Another exemplary rule is if the make is Dodge and the letters BR directly precede the numbers 1500 or 2500 or 3500 change the BR to the word pickup . Another exemplary rule is if the make is Mazda and the letters B directly precede the numbers 1600 1800 2000 2200 2300 2500 2600 3000 or 4000 in the model field then add the word pickup . Another exemplary rule is if the claim block and estimate block for models match except for the fact that one has the words SUPERDUTY then add the words SUPERDUTY to the block that does not have it. Another exemplary rule is if SUBURBAN is matched in a model field then change the make to CHEVROLET.

Another exemplary rule is if a match is on a row with S10 but S is not matched in the superset columns then S10 cannot be the match and skip the S10 row. Another exemplary rule is if S and 10 have been matched in a model field then the Model ID for 10 Series Truck cannot be a match. Another exemplary rule is if S and 10 are found in either the estimate block model field or the claim block model field then add S and 10 to both the claim block model field and the estimate block model field remove any other single letters or numbers or words with the exception of Blazer and if Blazer is found in either the claim block model field or the estimate block model field add Blazer to both the claim block and estimate block fields and remove any other text unless it is S10 .

Another exemplary rule is if CIERA or one of its aliases is found in a model field and Cutlass or one of Cutlass aliases is also found delete the word CUTLASS or its alias and continue in sequence. Another exemplary rule is if CALAIS or one of its aliases is found in a model field and Cutlass or one of Cutlass aliases is also found delete the word CUTLASS or its alias and continue in sequence. Another exemplary rule is if OLDSMOBILE or one of its aliases is matched as a make and Ninety or one of its aliases is matched then the row in table of including Oldsmobile with EIGHTY EIGHT in the MODEL column not shown as an entry in cannot be a match e.g. skip this row . Another exemplary rule is if Solara or one of its aliases is matched in a model filed then delete all words in the model field except SOLARA or it alias.

Another exemplary rule is if Voyager or one of its aliases is in the estimate block model field then delete all other words except Voyager in both claim block model field and estimate block model field. If Voyager or one of its aliases is in the claim block model field then delete all other words except Voyager in the claim block model. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block Model field is empty and the associated manufacturing field has a text string plus one of the following numbers preceding or following a term from the list 10 20 100 200 250 300 350 400 450 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 or 3500 then add the number to the associated model field and remove it from the manufacturing field.

Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field has the two words Dodge and RAM then remove the word RAM from the make field and add the words RAM and Pickup to the associated model field. Another exemplary rule is if the claim or estimate block make field has the words Dodge and the associated model field has the words Dakota and Pickup remove the word Pickup from the associated model field.

With respect to step the make model translator prepares the one or more make fields for translation by applying one or more rules from the plurality of rules. In some embodiments the make model translator converts make abbreviations to a corresponding corrected expanded spelling.

In some examples the make model translator cleans up the word strings after the previous adjustments e.g. steps . The make model translator separates all words by one space where a word is a group of text characters preceded and followed by a space including the first word in the word string that may not be preceded by a space and the last word in the word string that may not be followed by a space to remove any excess spaces. If the make model translator determines there are duplicate words within the word string the make model translator can be configured to delete the duplicative words.

With respect to step the make model translator associates each field of the one or more make fields with one or more make model entries from a plurality of predetermined make model entries. In some examples the make model translator uses a table to match the words in the claim and estimate block make fields with various predetermined make model entries.

The make model translator uses table of to match the words in the claim and estimate block make fields to the various information contained in each row and column. For example the make model translator compares word strings in the make fields against both the Manufacturer and Make columns columns and . When doing this comparison the make model translator keeps track of the hit rate for matches. The hit rate is the count of make matches divided by the number of words required for a perfect translation when matching make words or the count of manufacturer matches divided by the number of words required for a perfect translation when matching manufacturer words.

An example of aliasing using table is provided below using the temporary translation table of . First the first step the make model translator tests each word in the claim block make word string and searches for makes in table beginning in column and ending in column . The make model translator tests each word in the string against every word in each row s word set. If any words are matched in the rows word set then the make model translator determines there is a match and a solid row match. For each match the make model translator calculates the percentage by counting the number of unique matches dividing by the number of words for a perfect translation and multiplying by 100. The make model translator loads the row number from column of table percent manufacturer s name from column of table make name from column of table and super set and sub set information super set information is from columns the First Word Second Word Third Word Fourth Word and Fifth Word columns of and the sub set information is from columns the First Word Second Word Third Word Fourth Word and Fifth Word columns if available of table of model name into the temporary translation table . In some examples the row information and hit information is loaded into the temporary translation table while other information is not loaded in since the information is easily retrievable.

The make model translator repeats the first step above through the rest of the rows with a corresponding matching make in the make columns and until completed. If matches occur then the make model translator performs the second step below. In the first step the make model translator also tests each word in the claim block make word string and search for makes beginning instead of with columns and in the manufacturer column and ending in column . The make model translator tests each word in the string against every word in each row s word set. If any words are matched in the rows word set then the make model translator identifies a match and a solid row match and calculates the percentage and loads the pertinent information into the temporary translation table as described above. Second the second step the make model translator tests each word in the estimate block make word string and searches for makes in both columns and and then columns and as described above with reference to testing the claim block make word string.

With respect to step the make model translator associates each field of the one or more model fields with one or more make model entries from the plurality of predetermined make model entries e.g. the entries in table . As indicated above the aliases in table are specific to a manufacturer make model combination. The make model translator receives and or can act on more detailed model information in some cases. Advantageously the make model translator can further narrow down the parts for a vehicle within the model series. The more specific model information is called the subset where the more general model information is called the superset where every subset is the child of a superset. For the subset calculation the hit rate is the count of unique matches. For the superset the hit rate is the count of unique matches.

The make model translator tests each word in the claim block model word string and search for models in table in the model subset word sets beginning at columns and ending at column i.e. through columns and inclusive for those rows that had manufacturer or make matches in them from the rules associated with step above. The make model translator tests each word in the string against every word in each row s word set. If all words from each column are matched in the rows sub set word set then the make model translator identifies a 100 match and a solid row match. If the make model translator determines a less than a perfect match with the word set the match is not treated as a match.

For each 100 match the make model translator loads the row number percent manufacturer name make name superset subset model name into claim block information in the temporary translation table . The make model translator repeats the matching process through the rest of the sub set column s rows until completed. If a match has been found in the subset the super set column does not need to be tested. Otherwise the make model translator tests each word in the claim block model word string and search for models in table in the superset columns beginning in the super set column and ending in superset column for those rows that had manufacturer or make matches in them from the rules of step . The make model translator tests each word in the string against every word in each row s word set. If any words are matched in the rows word set then we have a match and a solid row match. If multiple rows are matched with the exact same vehicle description e.g. manufacturer make and superset model the make model translator deletes all but one of the identical rows. The make model translator calculates the percentage by counting the number of matches dividing by the number of words for a perfect translation and multiplying the quotient by 100. The make model translator loads the row number percent manufacturer name make name superset subset if available model name into claim block information in the temporary translation table . The make model translator repeats the process through the rest of the super set column s rows until completed. If there are no model matches in the rows where there have been make matches then the make model translator repeats the test on all of the make s manufacturer s rows in table for a model subset match and then model superset match as described above.

The make model translator searches for invalid model matches in the estimate block model word string e.g. MOTORCYCLE RG HARLEY KAWASAKI etc. . If a match occurs discontinue all testing of claim and estimate block data and indicate there is no translation available. Otherwise the make model translator tests each word in the estimate block model word string and searches for models in table beginning in the subset column and ending in subset column as well as beginning at superset column and ending at superset column if necessary as described above for matching the claim block model word string for those rows that had manufacturer or make matches in them from rules in step .

With respect to step the make model translator determines the best translation. The method started with four pieces of information the four fields of manufacturer make and model for the claims and estimating blocks. Through steps each has now been converted into lists of candidates in the temporary translation table . Each has a percent match weighting with how well the original field word string matched with the particular candidate word set. Now the temporary translation table as populated can have three different levels of row matches 4 way 3 way and 2 way each of which have the potential of different confidence weighting.

For example the subset takes precedence if the subset is a perfect 2 for 2 match or when it is a 100 match. If the subset is not a 100 match then the subset is considered 0 and only matches in the superset are considered. Due to the ranges for these match sets the match sets can overlap and cause ties. The following exemplary breakdown shows the extremes and averages of the matched sets 

a best match is a 4 way match e.g. a match across all four fields of the temporary translation table which can be represented by the number one 1 with a weighting range of 100 to 75 AVERAGE 87.50 

a second best match is either a 4 way match with a weighting range of 75 to 50 AVERAGE 62.50 or a 3 way match with an weighting range of 100 to 75 AVERAGE 87.50 

a third best match is either a 4 way match with a weighting range of 50 to 25 AVERAGE 37.50 a 3 way match with a weighting range of 75 to 50 AVERAGE 62.50 or a 2 way match with an weighting range of 100 to 75 AVERAGE 87.50 

a fourth best match is either a 4 way match with a weighting range of 25 to 0 AVERAGE 12.50 a 3 way match with a weighting range of 50 to 25 AVERAGE 37.50 or a 2 way match with an weighting range of 75 to 50 AVERAGE 62.50 

a fifth best match is either a 3 way match with an weighting range of 25 to 0 AVERAGE 12.50 or a 2 way match with an weighting range of 50 to 25 AVERAGE 37.50 

An exemplary way to create 4 way 3 way and 2 way average weights and goodness values for the match set is to use equations 1 through 4 

In some embodiments because the four pieces of information the make model translator is using are not deemed equal in value. For example the model information is rated higher than make information and estimate information is rated higher than claim information. For the example below assume 

Using the above definitions and also the fact that make to make matches carry insufficient information there are certain match possibilities combined with information preferences and precedents. A four way 4 way match possibility is ABCD. Three way 3 way match possibilities include BCD ACD ABC and ABD. Two way 2 way match possibilities include CD CB AD AB BD and AC.

The make model translator checks for the best translation in table . is an exemplary diagram of a match determination table . The match determination table includes hit percentage weighting fields and proposed translation fields . Hit percentage weighting fields includes claim block fields and estimate block fields . The claim block fields includes make field A and model fields super B and subset C. The estimate block fields include make field A and model fields super B and subset C. The proposed translation fields include the make fields and model fields . The make fields include the manufacturer mfg field A and the make field B. The model fields include the super field A and the subset field B. The match determination table also includes a row indicator .

The make model translator creates a temporary instance of the match determination table . The make model translator pulls all row matches from the temporary translation table which includes 4 way 3 way 2 way and 1 way matches. Since there may be matches from the same row all manufacturer make superset and subset information will be the same and therefore only needs to be entered once into the match determination table . As the 4 or 3 or 2 pieces of information are copied written into the match determination table the make model translator transfers the hit percentage into the appropriate column of the match determination Table .

Below is an exemplary list of rules the make model translator can use to govern the determination of a match. This listing is not intended to be limiting. If there is only one row with a subset match e.g. the make model translator determines a particular row of the match determination table has a subset match and there is only one row with a subset match the make model translator deletes all other rows indicates the remaining row contains the translation and move to the completion steps. If however there is more than one row the make model translator deletes duplicates.

If the make model translator determines there are multiple subset matches the make model translator calculates the goodness value using Equation 3 for all rows and selects the highest goodness valve as the translation and move to the completion steps. If this not the case continue in sequence. In the case of a tie the make model translator calculates the goodness value of the estimate block matches only and select the highest goodness value or we can select an estimate block subset hit over a claim block subset hit. If there is still a tie between multiple rows the make model translator checks to see if the individual components of the goodness value for each row are all at 100 e.g. Y 1 25 100 100 100 3 4 or Y 1 25 100 100 100 3 4 . If so the make model translator multiplies each component of each row by the number of words for a perfect translation in each component word field. For example if Y has a a make equal to Chevrolet which has one word for a perfect translation and b a model equal to s and 10 each with two words for a perfect translation for a claim make and model match and only a estimate model match then Y 1 25 100 1 100 2 100 2 3 6.64. As another example if Y has a a make equal to Chevrolet which has one word for a perfect translation and b a model equal to blazer and s10 where each has three words for a perfect translation for a claim make and model match and only an estimate model match then Y 1 25 100 1 100 3 100 3 3 9.33. The make model translator selects the highest adjusted goodness score and proceeds to the completion steps. Otherwise if there is a tie then the conflicting information does not provide a translation and the make model translator moves to the completion steps without a translation.

If one row has a 4 way match and there are no subset matches the make model translator identifies the row as the sole 4 way row match deletes all other rows and move to the final steps with the row as the proposed translation. If there is more than one row the make model translator delete duplicates. If there are multiple rows that have two or more 4 way matches and the proposed translations are not identical then the make model translator deletes all other rows and performs a tie break. An exemplary tie brake is illustrated below. The make model translator calculates the goodness value with Equation 2 for all rows and selects the highest goodness value as the translation and move to the completion steps. Otherwise if two or more 4 way hits exist with the same goodness value then as a tiebreak the make model translator calculates the goodness value e.g. add match percentages and divide by 2 for the estimate make and model component only. If the make model translator determines that one estimate block make model component that has a higher goodness value the make model translator select that as the match. Otherwise if there is still a tie between multiple rows the make model translator checks if the individual components of the Goodness Value for each row are all at 100 . e.g. Y 1 25 100 100 100 100 4 or Y 1 25 100 100 100 100 4 . If they are the make model translator multiplies each component of each row by the number of words for a perfect translation in each component word field. For example assume Y has a a make equal to Chevrolet which has one word for a perfect translation and b a model equal to s10 which has two words for a perfect translation. Therefore for a claim make and model match and a estimate make and model match Y 1 25 100 1 100 2 100 1 100 2 4 6.00. For example assume Y has a a make equal to Chevrolet which has one word for a perfect translation and b a model equal to Blazer s10 which has three words for a perfect match. Therefore for a claim make and model match and an estimate make and model match Y 1 25 100 1 100 3 100 1 100 3 4 8.00. The make model translator selects the highest adjusted goodness score. Otherwise if there is a tie then the conflicting information does not provide a translation and the make model translator moves to the completion steps.

If one row has a 3 way match and there are no subset or 4 way matches and the 3 way match is the sole 3 way row match the make model translator deletes all other rows indicates this proposed translation is the translation and move to the completion steps. If there is more than one row the make model translator deletes duplicates.

If one row has a 2 way match and there are no subset or 4 way or 3 way matches and the 2 way match is the sole 2 way row match the make model translator deletes all other rows and this proposed translation is identified as the translation and the make model translator moves to the completion steps. If there is more than one row the make model translator deletes duplicates.

If there are multiple rows that have two or more 3 way matches and the proposed translations are not identical the make model translator performs a tie break. For example the make model translator calculates the goodness value using Equation 3 for all rows and selects the highest goodness valve as the translation moving to the completion steps. Otherwise if the matches have the same goodness value then the make model translator determines if the match in one row is C and D and the other is A and B selecting the row with C D as the translation moving to the completion steps. Otherwise if there is still a tie between multiple rows the make model translator checks if the individual components of the goodness value for each row are all at 100 e.g. Y 1 25 100 100 100 3 and Y 1 25 100 100 100 3 . If they are all at 100 the make model translator multiplies each component of each row by the number of words for a perfect translation in each component word field as described above. The make model translator selects the highest adjusted goodness score. Otherwise if there is a tie then the conflicting information does not provide a translation and the make model translator moves to the completion steps.

If there are multiple rows that have one or more 3 way matches and one to more 2 way matches and the proposed translations are not identical the make model translator performs a tie breaker. For example the make model translator deletes all 2 way matches. If there is a single 3 way match or multiple 3 way matches with identical proposed translations the make model translator select this proposed translation as the translation and move to the completion steps. Otherwise the make model translator calculates the goodness value using Equation 3 for all rows and selects the highest goodness valve as the translation moving to the final step. If the matches have the same goodness value then if the match in one row is C and D and the other is A and B the make model translator selects the row with C D as the translation and moves to the completion steps. Otherwise if there is still a tie between multiple rows the make model translator checks if the individual components of the goodness value for each row are all at 100 as described above and if they are the make model translator multiplies each component of each row by the number of words for a perfect translation in each component word field. The make model translator selects the highest adjusted goodness score. Otherwise if there is a tie then the conflicting information does not provide a translation and the make model translator moves to the completion steps.

If there are multiple rows with 2 way matches and the proposed translation is not identical the make model translator performs a tie break. For example if there are A to C matches the make model translator deletes the A to C matches. If after the deletion there is only one 2 way match left the make model translator identifies the one 2 way match as the translation and moves to the completion steps. If there are A to B or A to D or C to D or B to C or B to D matches and the proposed translations are not identical the make model translator performs a tie break. For example the make model translator calculates the goodness value using Equation 4 for all rows and selects the highest goodness value as the translation moving to the completion steps. If the matches have the same goodness value then the make model translator can pick the row based on a predetermined priority e.g. the following list arranged with the highest priority first and continuing on to the lowest priority a CD match a CB match an AD match an AB match and lastly a BD match . If there is a tie then the conflicting information does not provide a translation and the make model translator moves to the completion steps. Otherwise if there is still a tie between multiple rows the make model translator checks if the individual components of the goodness value for each row are all at 100 as described above.

Lastly are the completion steps. If there are no matches hits there is not a translation available with the information provided. If the make model translator has two or more translations and the same goodness value then the make model translator selects the translation with the most column hits word matches as the default result. If more than one translation exists that have the same number of column hits then if there is still conflicting information that cannot be reconciled there is not a translation. Otherwise if a clear match winner has been chosen then the make model translator use that row translation as the make and model information.

In some embodiments all the operations described above for the make model translator are carried out linearly and in the order described. However this is not intended to be limiting and any combination of the above operations can be carried out in any order.

The auditing system uses the insurance company name translator to generate an accurate translation of a word string that can be related to a known level of an insurance company which in turn can be rolled up to the next higher level of the insurance companies hierarchy. Recurring patterns can be deduced from insurance company names e.g. by reviewing 10 000 insurance company names . In some examples the number of words used in the body of insurance company names is about 10 times larger than used in parts translation e.g. via parts translator . This can make aliasing of an insurance company name dictionary e.g. a template including all insurance company names for aliasing difficult because of stepping on other aliases. Abbreviations are often used in both the informal and formal names so the abbreviations cannot be blindly expanded e.g. as a preprocessing step . Insurance companies are licensed by state by product so in some examples insurance company names will appear fifty 50 times for one product if licensed all fifty 50 states. Therefore differentiating between the multiple insurance company names requires identification of the state the type of policy was issued in. Since the type of product is often included in the insurance company name the type of product may not need to be dealt with separately.

In some examples the majority of the insurance company names are made unique by just one word or at most two words. In some examples e.g. a small number of cases the insurance company names are made unique by the order of a sequence of common insurance words. In many of the insurance company name word strings the first one to three words not including grammatical articles are differentiating words that can be used to distinguish between insurance company names. In some insurance company name word strings where the differentiation comes toward the end of the word string the differentiating words are generally made up of locations e.g. town city county state region country . In insurance name word strings the order of the word sequence can be important and should be maintained as the word string is processed e.g. by the insurance company name translator . An analysis of the matching of the translated insurance company name word strings with other name word strings has shown that for some insurance company names common word matches should carry less weight than uncommon word matches. To increase accuracy the insurance company name translator can be configured to determine that a proper name for an insurance company exists in a translation table or dictionary if all words in the name are represented in the dictionary table or data structure being used to represent the insurance company names . The insurance company name translator can include rules that incorporate one or more of these recurring patterns.

Below is an example of a translation process e.g. carried out by the insurance company name translator with reference to the steps of method of . In a preferred embodiment the sequence of the steps is preserved for the insurance company name translation. However in other examples the steps can be executed in any order and in any combination without detracting from the insurance company name translation. For example translation steps can be added and removed as additional patterns are identified within insurance company names.

With respect to step the insurance company name translator receives data indicative of an insurance company name with one or more words. In some examples the insurance company name field word string is up to twelve words long.

In some embodiments the insurance company name translator generates a dictionary table e.g. table A of and a table to numerically list insurance company names to facilitate the insurance company name translation. This creation process includes for example listing information for each company e.g. a company code primary company name company group code FEIN federal employer identification number company business activity status state of domicile and words used in the subordinate word string . The insurance company name translator analyzes the company information to make cross references to data in the dictionary table accumulate counts of true occurrences of occurrence categories calculate word counts for the insurance company names and other comparisons of words in the insurance company names. The insurance company name translator calculates for example the lowest category of word usage the approximate usage number total in the first third of the word string the approximate usage number total in the second third of the word string and the approximate usage number total in the third third of the word string and whether the lowest usage word occurs in the first third second third or third third of the word string. The insurance company name translator creates in some embodiments a table that explains the number of times words are used within the list of company names by word string position and or a table that shows the position in the word string of words representing geographical locations. The insurance company name translator uses this calculated information while translating a word string into an insurance company name.

For state abbreviations if the insurance company name translator determines that the word string includes one or more of the word groups in columns of table the insurance company name translator can either leave the word groups e.g. if they appear in the state column or replace the word groups with the words in column of table e.g. if they appear in either the abbreviation or postal code columns . If the word is replaced or matched in column of table the insurance company name translator marks that word and location as a state or territory of the United States. Additionally if the first location word s position number is greater than the total number of words in the string the insurance company name translator notes the word position as 3 e.g. in tables one through five of steps A E of or in column the third of the word string the location words are located in column of table of . In some embodiments the word position is noted during the development of the group table as described above. If the replacement word in table is actually two words separated by a coma where either word may be one or two words the insurance company name translator creates two words strings placing one of the coma separated words in each word string. Both word strings will be evaluated by the insurance company name translator .

To add spaces if necessary the insurance company name translator can be configured to verify there is a space before and after each punctuation mark e.g. a coma hyphen slash and in the word string. For example the insurance company name translator translates R R to R   R U Bolt to U   Bolt Ring Retainer to Ring   Retainer and spock shield to spock   shield where   is used to indicate a space that was added in the word string by the insurance company name translator .

To process abbreviations for the word and the insurance company name translator can determine if the abbreviation for the word and exists e.g. and if so replace it with the word and. The insurance company name translator can be configured to remove characters from the word string e.g. comas hyphens slashes and other grammatical non alpha numeric characters . The insurance company name translator can also be configured to process alpha numeric word groups within the insurance company name word into two separate word groups within the name string e.g. the insurance company name translator translates by inserting a space to   xy .

With respect to step the insurance company name translator processes the data e.g. the word string through one or more processing steps to generate processed data comprising one or more processed words. For example the insurance company name translator is configured to correct the spelling and usage number of words in the word string.

The insurance company name translator determines if each word in the word string is spelled correctly and is in the name dictionary which is column . Or if the insurance company name translator determines there is an alias match column the insurance company name translator replaces the alias with the spelling in column .

The insurance company name translator for each word matched in column should record the corresponding usage number in column e.g. the corresponding usage number is calculated in that row by looking the word up in a numerical listing of companies not shown in addition to recording that the word is spelled correctly. For the remaining words that are not matched in columns or the insurance company name translator can log them as not in the dictionary for reference if necessary.

The insurance company name translator can include a minimum criteria to continue translation. If the insurance company name translator identifies words that do not have a match in column then the insurance company name translator checks whether there is a match in the column . The insurance company name translator selects the first matches found chooses the corresponding correct spelling in column and again records the usage number corresponding to the match in column e.g. the corresponding usage number is calculated in that row by looking the word up in a numerical listing of companies not shown .

The insurance company name translator follows the sequence described below. The sequence describes worst case so the insurance company name translator continues on anything better than worst case. If the insurance company name translator determines the name word string is one word long then if the word has been matched in column or the insurance company name translator continues to and the associated description calculating the word usage and recording the number in column . Otherwise if not the insurance company name translator stops the translation process and places the name word string in the un translated log string.

If the insurance company name translator determines the name word string is two words long then if the insurance company name translator matched the first word in column or and has not matched the second word the insurance company name translator continue to and the associated description unless the insurance company name translator determines the first word has a usage in column equal to or greater than 100 or if the first word translated as THE. If either of these cases exist insurance company name translator stops translation and places the name word string in the un translated log string. If the name word string is two words long and if the insurance company name translator matched the second word in column or and has not matched the first word the insurance company name translator continues to and the associated description unless the second word has a usage in column equal to or greater than forty 40 . If the usage number of the second word is greater than forty 40 the insurance company name translator stops the translation and places the name word string in the un translated log string.

If the insurance company name translator determines the name word string is three words long then if the insurance company name translator matched the first word of the three in column or and the insurance company name translator has not matched either the second or third words the insurance company name translator continues to and the associated description unless the insurance company name translator determines the first word has a usage in column equal to or greater than one hundred 100 or the first word translated as THE. If either of these cases exists the insurance company name translator stops the translation and places the name word string in the un translated log string. If the name word string is three words long and if the insurance company name translator has matched the second word in column or and the insurance company name translator has not matched either the first and third words the insurance company name translator continues to and the associated description unless the insurance company name translator determines the second word has a usage in column equal to or greater than forty 40 . If the insurance company name translator determines the second word s usage number is greater than forty 40 the insurance company name translator stops translating and places the name word string in the un translated log string. If the name word string is three words long and if the insurance company name translator has matched the third word in column or and the insurance company name translator has not matched either the first or second words the insurance company name translator stops the translation and places the name word string in the un translated log string unless the third word has a usage in column less than ten 10 . If the third word s usage number is less than ten 10 the insurance company name translator continues to and the associated description.

If the insurance company name translator determines the name word string is greater than three words e.g. four to eleven words long if the insurance company name translator determines the first three words in the string do not meet the minimum criteria of the three word step above the insurance company name translator stops the translation and places the name word string in the un translated log string and stop translation. Otherwise the insurance company name translator continues to and the associated description. If the insurance company name translator determines that there are no matches in either column or then the insurance company name translator places the one or more word in the unmatched error log along with a copy of the entire name word string and stops the translation process.

After completing the sequence above the insurance company name translator should have generated a correctly spelled word string e.g. a word string of 1 to 12 words with the word usage attached to each word and location words designated by a logical YES. is an exemplary diagram of one or more processed words words WORD through WORD collectively called words each word being associated with a USAGE and a Y N LOCAL. If there are duplicate words possible because of the abbreviations then there will be two effective correctly spelled word strings where one word in both strings will be different. is an exemplary diagram of two word strings of processed words. Word string includes WORD WORD A to represent a first duplicate word and WORD through WORD each word being associated with a USAGE and a Y N LOCAL. Word string includes WORD WORD B to represent a second duplicate word and WORD through WORD each word being associated with a USAGE and a Y N LOCAL. While depict twelve words this is for illustrative purposes only and it should be understood that the processed word string can include any number of words e.g. one word two words etc. .

Otherwise if the insurance company name translator did not generate a correctly spelled word string then the translation would be stopped and the insurance company name translator would have generated an error log including for example the complete un translated name word string and or the word or words that would not translate.

With respect to step the insurance company name translator selects one or more candidate word strings based on the one or more processed words e.g. . Name word strings often have two patterns those with a definitive word and those with a definitive local called out. For the definitive word pattern many word strings have the definitive word for the name word string located within the first three words of the string. For example on a surveyed sample of insurance company name word strings 93.18 of words used once in a name string occur in the first three word positions 93.89 of words used twice in name strings occur in the first three positions 93.78 of words used three times in name strings occur in the first three positions 94.89 of words used four times in name strings occur in the first three positions and 93.55 of words used five to ten times in name strings occur in the first three positions. This pattern may account for for example approximately 85 of insurance company names. Another pattern is the pattern where a local is specified in the last third of the world string e.g. Mutual Insurance Company of Montana . This pattern may account for for example approximately 10 to 12 of insurance company names. Additionally common words can be used to translate the insurance company field which can depend on the sequence to differentiate the name e.g. Mutual Fire and Marine Insurance Company .

In steps A E the insurance company name translator searches the appropriate table for the word match and the possible name strings that might be the correct insurance company name. Table one for step A is an instance of table with similar information as that of table of . Table one includes for example only word strings with one unique word and information about each child includes the company code name parent index company number fein company status state of domicile first position second position third position fourth position fifth position sixth position seventh position eighth position ninth position tenth position eleventh position twelfth position word count final review of lowest categories in word string one third cell count approximate first third category weighting approximate second third category weighting approximate third third category weighting first third the lowest category number appears first position of location word in word string number of location words per word string and the one third of the word string the location word s are located. Table two through table five include for example word strings with two unique words word strings with three unique words word strings with four unique words and word strings with five unique words respectively.

If there is more than one word with a word usage e.g. if there is more than one word in the name string the insurance company name translator selects the first word. If two name word strings have been created the insurance company name translator keeps the return word string sets separate since the analysis will be done separately and then compared. This is done for usage numbers between one and five going to tables corresponding to the usage number and returning the rows that match that name string word e.g. table one will return A one row since this is a direct match and is therefore the translation table two will return B two rows table three will return C three rows table four will return D four rows and table five will return E five rows .

For greater than the category of five usage words if the insurance company name translator uses an index table e.g. table of or table of searching for a match in column returning F as many rows as there are matches in column . If the insurance company name translator identifies a group of identical rows the insurance company name translator returns the first row.

If the insurance company name translator determines there are no matches in column of an index table e.g. table of or table of then the insurance company name translator searches for the low usage word in the body of an index table e.g. table of or table of columns through columns returning all rows matched for analysis. The insurance company name translator can also log an error in the index list since the body of an index table e.g. table of or table of had to be used for this word.

With respect to step the insurance company name translator associates matching information with each of the one or more candidate word strings. At this point the insurance company name translator has calculated the number of words in the name string the sequence of the words in the name string if one of the words is a city state country or region and the number of rows e.g. possible name strings that may be the correct insurance company name. The returned rows e.g. from steps B through F contains word string words a word string count an indication of whether a location word exists an indication of the location words position an indication of what third of the word string the location word is in and word usage for each word in the string. This information is saved along with the original name word string. If for example the insurance company name translator performed a dual search there are two sets of information.

With respect to step the insurance company name translator generates analysis information for each of the one or more candidate word strings based on the associated matching information. is a flow chart of an exemplary method for generating analysis information for one or more word strings. The insurance company name translator receives the returned rows e.g. from one of steps B through F from the search. The information returned with each row includes for example the word string and information indicative of the word count the existence of the location name the position of the location name which third of the string e.g. the first third second third or last third of the word string the location name is positioned in and the word usage for each word in the string. The insurance company name translator checks the information indicative of the existence of the location name to determine whether there is a location name in the word string. If there is a location name in the word string the insurance company name translator determines whether the location name is in the last third of the word string e.g. by checking the information indicative of which third of the string the location name is positioned in . If the location name is in the last third of the word string the insurance company name translator processes the string assuming the location name is not an integral part of the insurance company name. The insurance company name translator determines whether the target word string has a location word. If the target word string has a location word the insurance company name translator determines whether the location word in the target word string is in the last third of the target word string. If the location word is not in the last third then the insurance company name translator ignores the last third of the candidate word string when performing the calculations.

If the insurance company name translator determines the location name is not in the last third of the word string the insurance company name translator processes the word string assuming the location name is an integral part of the insurance company name. The insurance company name translator calculates information about the target and one or more candidate word strings storing the information with each potential candidate word string in an analysis output table. The information includes a difference in total words a number of word matches a weighted word match count a weighted word count a weighted match difference a sequence number count and an average sequence number count.

The insurance company name translator calculates the difference in total or the difference in the number of words in the original string e.g. string A and each string that was returned e.g. strings B C etc. returned through steps B through F . The difference is calculated for example as the word count of string A subtracted from the word count of string B . The insurance company name translator stores these results in the analysis output table.

The insurance company name translator determines the number of word matches between the original word name string A and the word name strings returned B C etc. . The insurance company name translator can store these results in the analysis output table.

The insurance company name translator calculates a weighted word match count or weighted match count . The weighted word match count is calculated by using the word usage number. Each match equals one and is multiplied by the usage multiplier as shown below these products are all summed and the results are stored in the analysis output table. The multipliers are shown below for each match case 

The insurance company name translator calculates the weighted word count for the original name string and each name string returned. The insurance company name translator calculates the weighted word count by using the word usage number. Each word equals one and is multiplied by the usage multiplier shown below. The insurance company name translator sums these products for each name string and the results are stored in the analysis output table. Exemplary multipliers are shown below for each word usage 

The insurance company name translator calculate the weighted match difference by subtracting the weighted word count from the weighted word match count. The results are stored in the analysis output table.

The insurance company name translator calculates the sequence number count of the lowest usage match. The insurance company name translator calculates the sequence number count by computing the difference in relative sequence of the lowest usage word e.g. the word used the least in the word string in the original name word string from each of the returned word strings words that match. For example if the lowest usage word in the original name string is aetna it was in the second position in the sequence of the original string and the returned name string where it matched was in the first position then the count would be 1. If for example it had been in the third position then it would be 1 in the fifth position then it would be 3 etc. The results are stored in the analysis output table.

The insurance company name translator calculates the average absolute sequence number count for all matches. The insurance company name translator calculates the average absolute sequence number count as the difference in relative sequence of the word in the original name word string from each of the returned word strings words that match. For example if the word in the original name string was in the second position in the sequence of the original string and the returned name string where it matched was in the first position then the count would be 1 if it had been in the third position it would be 1 in the fifth position it would be 3 etc. Because it is the average then there are no signs. Usually for each match the insurance company name translator will calculate a number between 0 and 10. The insurance company name translator sums the matches dividing by the number of matches to calculate the average sequence number count. The results are stored in the analysis output table.

With respect to step the insurance company name translator associates an insurance company identifier with received data based on the analysis information and one or more matching rules. The analysis output table includes for each candidate word string based on the original word string a difference in total words a number of word matches a weighted word match count a weighted word count a weighted match difference a sequence number count and an average sequence number count. In some examples the evaluation of the analysis output table is based on word usage.

In some examples the majority of the words fall into 4 5 word positions and the majority of the differentiating words fall into the first 2 3 word positions. What comprises a common word usage is based on positions and and can also be based on positions and . Common words mostly make up positions thru as a percentage of totals even though the word volume tails off as the position increases.

The insurance company name translator uses rules to determine the best possible match. An exemplary rule set is described below which is intended to be illustrative only and not limiting. The insurance company name translator determines if the word usage number was one and there is a signal row match out of table . If this is the case the insurance company name translator concludes with that row as the translation. The insurance company name translator indicates a table translation in the analysis log next to the original name string the translated name string and the parent index number. Otherwise the insurance company name translator determines if the original name string is one word in length and the word usage number on that word is below 49. If so the insurance company name translator moves forward in the translation e.g. Aetna has a usage of 33 .

The insurance company name translator determines if one row is returned with a match and if so then the insurance company name translator determines the row is the translation. The insurance company name translator indicates a table translation in the analysis log next to the original name string the translated name string and the parent index number. Otherwise if the insurance company name translator determines multiple rows are returned with matches the insurance company name translator tests the analysis output table. The test involves the insurance company name translator looking at five values i.e. the absolute value of the account difference the absolute value of the number of matches the number of words in the target word string the absolute value of the weighted match difference and the absolute value of the average sequence match count all of which are sought to be minimized for the best match. For example the insurance company name translator can compute the absolute value of the account difference plus the absolute value of the number of matches minus the number of words in the target word string plus the absolute value of the weighted match difference plus the absolute value of the sequence count number plus the absolute value of the average sequence match count. The lowest number computed for all the rows is the translation.

For example shows an exemplary string table and an exemplary analysis output table tables A and B collectively the analysis output table . The first word string in the string table row A is the target word string which is AXIS COMPANY. The remaining four word strings rows B D are the candidate word strings identified through the insurance company name translator using one or more of the steps described above e.g. using the analysis calculations described above with reference to . The candidate word strings are AXIS INSURANCE COMPANY AXIS REINSURANCE COMPANY AXIS SPECIALTY INSURANCE COMPANY and AXIS SURPLUS INSURANCE COMPANY. The calculations e.g. as described with respect to step of for each row of the string table are shown in the two analysis output table extensions A B. Each row in the analysis output tables correspond to a row in the string table e.g. row A of string table corresponds to row A of table A and row A of table B and so on . The column titled calculation in table B shows the output of the absolute value of the account difference plus the absolute value of the number of matches minus the number of words in the target word string plus the absolute value of the weighted match difference plus the absolute value of the sequence count number plus the absolute value of the average sequence match count. The lowest number output for all the rows is the translation which is row B. Thus AXIS COMPANY is translated to AXIS INSURANCE COMPANY. 

Parts translator includes first parts translator A and second parts translator B which the auditing system uses to translate part line items. In some embodiments parts translator includes only one translator. In some examples one or both of the first parts translator A and the second parts translator B are used to translate the word strings. In some embodiments the first parts translator A and the second parts translator B are combined into one translator. Database stores information needed by parts translator . For example database can store one or more data tables for the translation process see e.g. Tables 1 17 one or more rules used by the parts translator and or one or more rules associated with each of the client computers .

As discussed above the audit report generated by the output unit can include an audit report of parts a parts audit report an audit of operations an operations audit report compliance information a pay no pay recommendation a settlement process or an estimate based on both the parts audit report and the operations audit report a multi point estimate audit . The auditing system can use the part translator to generate identifiers e.g. part identifiers for part items for use in generating audit reports.

The auditable items e.g. part are made up of both alphanumeric and non alphanumeric characters. The auditable items can be for example line items for an insurance demand file. For example a line item can include characters indicative of a line item number an entry number a labor type an operation a line item description a part type or part number a dollar amount a labor unit and or the like. Examples of line item descriptions are R FRT OTR BELT MOULDING FRT BUMPER ASSY DOOR W SIDE MIRROR SHELL REPAIR 3 HOURS RADIO CD PLAYER INCL 1 FRT R SPEAKER PLUG CONNECTION 250 HP ENGINE SPORT SUSPENSION WITH RALLY PACKAGE and or the like. These examples are not included to be limiting or conclusive but are provided for illustrative exemplary purposes only.

The auditing system accepts or rejects each auditable item based on the item identifier and one or more rules associated with the data file. For example if the auditing system determines the item identifier for an auditable item is rejected based on the one or more rules associated with the data file the auditing system accepts auditable item. If the auditing system determines the item identifier is accepted based on the one or more rules the auditing system accepts the auditable item. If the word string is unsuccessfully translated into a word string e.g. at step the auditing system can log the word string as an unsuccessful translation. If the auditing system unsuccessfully associates the translated item description with a single item identifier the auditing system can associate the translated item description with a plurality of item identifiers. For example the auditing system can associate the translated item description with the five closest item identifiers. Advantageously when there are close associations a user can be presented with the closest matches and select the best match for the auditable item.

The auditing system preprocesses the word string associated with the auditable item. Preprocessing includes for example removing one or more orientation words from the word string removing one or more unnecessary words from the word string adding a space before one or more punctuation marks in the word string and other types of preprocessing.

An exemplary listing of orientation words includes FR FRONT FRT FT INNER INR L LEFT LH LOWER LT LWR OTR OUTER R REAR RH RHT RIGHT RT UPPER and UPR. The auditing system can include one or more rules e.g. stored in DB to remove unneeded words from the word string based on identifying one or more orientation words. The truncated word string i.e. the word string with the identified words removed is processed by additional steps if any.

The auditing system can test the word string for various type of punctuation characters to determine whether all characters are preceded by a space and followed by a space. The auditing system can include one or more rules to add spaces as needed to prepare the word string for further processing. For example SIDE MIRROR WITH ELECTRICAL CONTROL can be translated into SIDE MIRROR WITH ELECTRICAL CONTROL . 

The auditing system determines whether or not the word string contains one or more specific words. If the word string contains one or more specific words the auditing system removes the standard terms. Standard terms are terms that have no real impact on the part being described. An exemplary list of standard terms includes 2 DOOR 3 DOOR 4 DOOR 2 CYLINDER 4 CYLINDER 6 CYLINDER 8 CYLINDER 2 WHEEL DRIVE and REPLACE . The auditing system can include one or more rules to remove standard terms and to truncate the word string for further processing.

In some examples the standard terms can include the words such as repair and or finishing on certain body parts such as door shells and or panels and or the like. The auditing system include have one or more rules to look for these types of word phrases and to remove any unnecessary words. For example DOOR W SIDE MIRROR SHELL REPAIR 3 HOURS is translated into DOOR W SIDE MIRROR. 

In some examples the standard terms can include the term cross member and various equivalents e.g. x mbr . The auditing system can include one or more rules to remove the term s . The standard terms can include other terms that do not add value to the identification of the part. For example RADIO CD PLAYER INCL 8 FRT R SPEAKER PLUG CONNECTION is translated into RADIO CD PLAYER. 

The auditing system determines whether the word string contains one or more predetermined terms. If the auditing system contains one or more predetermined terms the auditing system processes the word string according to one or more rules associated with the predetermined terms. The predetermined terms can include for example heads up display sport suspension standard suspension automatic or manual transmission manual and or steering followed by a word starting with co combination and or other terms and abbreviations e.g. std sus for standard suspension of such terms. For example 250 HP ENGINE SPORT SUSPENSION WITH RALLY PACKAGE is translated to 250 HP ENGINE 250 HP ENGINE STD SUS WITH MAN TRANS is translated to 250 HP ENGINE FLOOR MOUNTED SHIFTER MAN TRANS STD RATIO is translated to FLOOR MOUNTED SHIFTER SHIFT LEVER MANUAL STEERING COLUMN is translated to SHIFT LEVER and FRT R COMBINATION LAMP is translated to FRONT RIGHT COMBINATION LAMP. 

In some examples the standard terms can be used to identify groupings of terms. shows an exemplary table for groupings. The first column labeled Designator includes the designator words. The second through sixth columns labeled Term Term Term Term Term respectively include additional terms which can be associated with the designator. The seventh column labeled Orient includes orientation words associated with the designator word in the Designator column. The eighth column labeled Desc contains descriptor words and the ninth column labeled Name contains item names. The auditing system can include one or more rules to process a word string based on table . For example the auditing system can search for a designator word. If a designator word is found the word string can be examined and replaced with the correct orientation word from the Orientation column and the correct descriptor and item names from the Desc and Name columns.

In some examples the standard terms can include any abbreviations for without and with . The auditing system can include rules to remove the abbreviations. The rules can be further configured to remove the part of the word string following those abbreviations. For example L FRT DOOR W ELECTRIC LOCK is translated to L FRT DOOR. 

In some examples the standard terms can include metric indicators. The metric indicators can be for example alphanumeric alpha and numerical characters related to metrics. shows an exemplary table for translating metric words. The first column labeled Metric Words lists various metric alias words. The second column labeled Correct Word lists the actual word the associated word in the Metric Words column. The third column labeled Text Numeric Words lists various textual and numeric metric words. The fourth column labeled Correct Word lists the actual word associated with the word in the Text Numeric Words column. For example the numeric word corresponds to the correct word one quarter. The auditing system can include one or more rules for dealing with metrics. For example the auditing rules may remove the metrics. Some auditing rules may keep metric indicators such as 1 2 and 3 for example. As an illustrative example 4.2 L ENGINE is translated to ENGINE and ENGINE FOR A 240ZX MODEL is translated to ENGINE FOR A MODEL. The rules can be configured to delete the metric words from the word string and concatenate the remaining word string together for further processing.

In some examples the standard terms can include computer generated formats. For example computer generated formats can include code notations such as a part description followed by a dash multiple spaces and or a 2 digit code number. For example R FRT FENDER 24 is translated to R FRT FENDER. The auditing system can include rules to identify computer generated formats and remove the superfluous computer generated custom codes.

In some examples the standard terms can include non alphanumeric characters. The auditing system can include rules to determine if non alpha numeric characters are in the word string and to remove the characters. The rules can be configured to keep certain non alphanumeric characters in the word string. For example the rules can be configured to keep comas in the word string. The rules can also be configured to upon determining parentheses exist in the word string to remove all text and characters within the parentheses. The rules can also be configured to upon determining quotes exist in the word string to also remove all text within the quote. For example TINTED WINDSHIELD EMBEDDED ANTENNA is translated to TINTED WINDSHIELD. 

In some examples the standard terms can include single letters. For an item name there are often finite single letter word string combinations that are allowable. The auditing system can include rules to determine if the individual letter s are allowable and if not they can be removed from the word string. In some examples the standard terms can include the term TYPE. The auditing system can include a rule to determine if the word string contains the word TYPE. The rules can be further configured to remove the word TYPE and all subsequent words.

The auditing system determines whether the word string contains one or more abbreviations. If the auditing system contains one or more abbreviations the auditing system processes the word string according to one or more rules associated with the abbreviations. is a diagram of an exemplary table for translating abbreviations. The first column of table labeled To Be Converted includes abbreviations which may exist in a word string. The second column labeled Convert To is the value the corresponding abbreviation from column one is converted to by for example one or more rules in the auditing system . For example if the abbreviation W S is located in a word string the abbreviation is translated to WINDSHIELD 4WD is translated to FOUR WHEEL DRIVE and so on. The abbreviations can include both text and non text characters. An exemplary rule can be configured to determine if there are any text non text abbreviation matches in the first column. For each match in the To Be Converted column the abbreviation is replaced by the corresponding text in the Convert To column.

The abbreviations can include dual meaning abbreviations. For example R can either be Right or Rear. is a diagram of an exemplary table of dual meaning abbreviations. The first column labeled Abbreviation includes dual meaning abbreviations and the second column labeled Conversion is the a conversion for the corresponding dual meaning abbreviation in the Abbreviation column. One or more rules in the auditing system can be configured to handle the dual meaning abbreviations by searching for abbreviations e.g. terms in the Abbreviation column of table and replacing the abbreviations with the proper conversion terms e.g. the Conversion column of table . For example if the rule detects R RUNNING BOARD in the word string it is translated to RIGHT RUNNING BOARD. 

The auditing system determines whether the word string contains header information. If the auditing system contains header information the auditing system processes the word string according to one or more rules associated with the header information. Header information can include CCC Header information.

Each row of table can have an associated rule for performing the header information conversion. For example for row one containing AIR CONDITIONER HEATER insert AIR CONDITIONER at the beginning of the word string if a word from the following list of words is in the word sting FAN HOSE SHROUD CONDENSER EVAPORATOR CASE LINE SWITCH PIPE TUBE MOTOR BLOWER CLUTCH HEATER HOUSING COMPRESSOR VENT CORE PULLEY CONTROL OPENING BOX CAP EYE HUB DUCT UNIT INLET BLADE BRACE CABLE COVER FRAME MOUNT PLATE SHAFT STRUT VALVE BAFFLE FILLER GRILLE MODULE SHIELD SYSTEM CONTROL SUPPORT ACTUATOR MANIFOLD RECEIVER DISTRIBUTOR GAS OIL FUSE FLEX ROOF TANK GUARD IDLER MOUNT FILTER OUTLET WIRING INSULATOR PROTECTOR DEHYDRATOR THERMOSTAT REFRIGERANT TRANSMISSION and LABEL. However if inserting AIR CONDITIONER causes a duplication do not insert the term. If none of the words are in the word string do not use the word AIR CONDITIONER and go to HEATER a separate row in table not shown and test for those words.

For example for row two containing AIR CONDITIONER HEATER don t insert HEATER at the beginning of the word string if it causes a duplication. Insert HEATER if at least one of the following words are in the word string WIRING CASE CORE BLOWER EVAPORATOR HOUSING DUCT SWITCH UNIT COVER BEZEL CONTROL RETAINER BRACKET SEAL FAN and ASSEMBLY. Otherwise if none of these words are present do not insert the word HEATER. 

For example for row three containing BACK DOOR don t insert BACK in orientation and DOOR in the beginning of the word string if it causes duplication. Insert BACK in orientation and DOOR in the beginning of the word string if at least one of these words are present in the word string LOCK SKIN LATCH PANEL SHELL VISOR HANDLE SWITCH REGULATOR LIFT OPENER MOTOR FILLER WIRING HARNESS OPENING WEATHERSTRIP GASKET PANEL TRIM GLASS INSULATION HINGE MOULDING TRIM PANEL WINDOW POST MIRROR MODULE SILL TAPE VENT INSULATOR PROTECTOR SASH ROD LATCH SCUFF STONE WATER WHEEL PILLAR ROCKER ARMREST FRAME CONTROL GARNISH SPEAKER STRIKER GRAVEL CLADDING TRACK LINK SHIELD SHROUD IMPACT INSERT CATCH BUSHING ENERGY SIGNAL CYLINDER DEFLECTOR TIE BOLT or SCREW.

For example for row four containing BACK GLASS don t insert BACK in orientation and GLASS in the beginning of the word string if it causes duplication. Insert BACK in orientation and GLASS in the beginning of the word string if at least one of these words are present in the word string MOTOR WEATHERSTRIP OPENING TRIM MOULDING LENS DAM STRIKER GUIDE CHANNEL SEAL GASKET RUN RETAINER RAIL and FASTENER.

For example for row five containing BODY SIDE PANELS don t insert SIDE in orientation and BODY and PANEL in the beginning of the word string if it causes duplication or if none of these words are present in the word string ANTENNA TRAILER GAUGE GLOVE RADIO CD CASSETTE FUEL REARVIEW AIR FINISH SHIELD HINGE LATCH PAN BRACE MOULDING SUPPORT LINER SPEAKER HOLDER BELT CARPET SILL WEATHERSTRIPE CLADDING PAD TAPE MOUNT SUPPORT PIN INSERT ROD BAR EYE REINFORCEMENT NUT BOLT STAY BRACKET RETAINER RIVET CLIP EMBLEM DECAL CONTROL APPLIQUE SEAL GASKET NAMEPLATE GLOVE CLUSTER WHEEL GROMMET SCREW FASTENER BEZEL CHANNEL GUIDE HAZARD SWITCH WIRING PROTECTOR ASHTRAY SPEAKER STONE HARNESS GUTTER GARNISH RAIL and REGULATOR.

For example for row six containing CAB don t insert CABIN in the beginning of the word string if it causes duplication or if none of the following words are present in the word string RUNNING TRANSFER FUEL SECTION ROOF TRIM PANEL BAR FRAME CORNER FILLER SPEAKER MOULDING DOOR SUNVISOR COWL LOCK PILLAR SEAT BACKUP LAMP ROCKER LICENSE UNDERSIDE WINDSHIELD ANTENNA GLASS WINDOW DASH DOME FUEL HEATER LAMP TAPE CARPET VENT FLOOR DRIVE GRILLE INLET DAMPER HEADER FLARE CONTROL SUNROOF OVERHEAD PRESSURE TAILGATE and AIR.

For example for row eight containing CENTER PILLAR ROCKER PANEL don t insert CENTER in orientation and PILLAR in the beginning of the word string if it causes duplication or if none of the following words are present in the word string MOULDING WINDOW TRIM BAFFLE BELT PANEL ROCKER COVER FINISH INSULATOR GARNISH WEATHERSTRIP FILLER BRACE EXTENSION HANDLE LAMP VENT DECAL LABEL and APPLIQUE. If none of the words are in the word string do not use the word CENTER PILLAR and go to ROCKER PANEL a separate row in table not shown and test for those words.

For example for row ten containing CONSOLE don t insert CONSOLE in the beginning of the word string if it causes duplication or if none of the following words are present in the word string FLOOR HAZARD WINDOW CONTROL TRANSFER SEAT BOOT VENT CD RADIO SWITCH ARMREST AMPLIFIER CUSHION DOOR KEY FLEX SHELF WASHER BATTERY SHIFTER SPEAKER INTERIOR PROTECTOR PARK OUTLET AIR MAT TRIM MOULDING HOLDER LINING ASHTRAY HARNESS HOUSING COMPARTMENT LID BEZEL BRACKET STRIP KNOB RETAINER SHIFT MOUNT REINFORCEMENT DOME VIDEO and CABLE.

For example for row eleven containing CONVERTIBLE TOP don t insert CONVERTIBLE in the beginning of the word string if it causes duplication or if none of these words are present in the word string TOP BLOCK COVER GLASS WASHER EXHAUST LIFT MOTOR HINGE PILLAR DOOR ROCKER CROSS TRUNK BATTERY ROOF FENDER QUARTER PANEL SEAL and BOW.

The auditing system determines whether the word string contains one or more ambiguous terms. If the auditing system contains one or more ambiguous terms the auditing system processes the word string according to one or more rules associated with the one or more ambiguous terms. The one or more ambiguous terms can include dual meaning words in the word string. For example the word Clip can be either a grouping of parts or a simple fastener.

The one or more rules can be configured to determine if the word string includes any dual meaning words from columns Or Or or Or. For example if the word string includes one or more dual meaning words and the words are preceded by any of the sets of words shown in columns And And And or And and none of the words shown in constraint columns Constraint Constraint Constraint or Constraint appear in the word string then the words from the item name orientation and descriptor columns can be placed in the item name orientation descriptor portion of the matching table e.g. the CNHQPD Table . The words do not need to be in sequence in the word string nor do the words need to be the only words in the string to match. If for example the word string is translated the word string can be matched to an identifier see e.g. .

The auditing system determines whether the word string contains one or more predetermined terms. If the word string contains one or more predetermined terms the auditing system processes the predetermined terms. The auditing system determines whether the word string contains one or more punctuation marks. If the word string contains one or more punctuation marks the auditing system processes the punctuation marks. The auditing system determines if the word string is able to be matched to an identifier. The auditing system can estimate the answer if there is not enough information for the word string. The auditing system matches the word string to an identifier. If at any time the word string is represented by a single word that word is deemed the item name. The auditing system can move to the matching table for comparison with identifiers.

The auditing system e.g. in a rules engine has a set of rules that addresses specific parts. For example a rule can be configured to determine if the word string contains the words converter and exhaust then the descriptor is catalytic and the item name is converter. These specific part rules can be used to help identify common word usage in part descriptions. All of the rules can be run against the word string in sequence.

The auditing system has a set of rules that addresses the use of combinations of common words used in part descriptions. For example a rule can be configured to determine if the word string contains the word set four wheel drive but not the word axle and delete the word set four wheel drive. These rules can be used to help avoid misleading word combinations that make the word string appear ambiguous. All of the rules can be run against the word string in sequence.

The predetermined items can include orientation words punctuation and or combinations of words. Orientation words describe the location or placement of a part.

An exemplary list of Orientation Words is BACK BACKWARD BOTTOM CENTER DRIVER DRIVERSIDE FLEET FORWARD FRONT INNER LEFT LOWER MIDDLE OUTER PASSENGER PASSENGERSIDE REAR RIGHT SIDE STEP UNDER UP and UPPER. If there are word matches in the word string with terms from the Orientation Words the rules can be configured to move these to the matching table e.g. the CNHQPD Table for placement in the orientation fields in the same sequence they appear in the word string. The rules can be configured to remove the orientation words from the word string.

If the remaining word string begins with a coma one or more rules can be configured to delete the coma before continuing processing the word string. If the word string has the first and or the second word delineated by a coma the one or more rules can be configured to determine the first and or second words in the string is the item name unless the word is assembly or set. If for example the word preceding the coma is assembly or set the rules can be configured to delete the word assembly or set. If for example there is a word that was preceding assembly or set the one or more rules can be configured to treat the word as the item name and all other words as descriptors of the item name. The one or more rules can be configured after determining the word preceding the coma is not assembly or set to treat the word preceding the coma as the item name e.g. and to load the word into the item name field in the CNHQPD Table . The rules can be configured to treat the other word as the first descriptor and the remainder of the string can be loaded into the following descriptor fields in their present sequence. The rules can be configured to remove all comas in the word string. The rules can be configured to make sure that all words are separated by just one space. Based on the processing the rules can be configured to match an identifier with the word string or continue processing.

The rules can be configured to deal with groupings of words. For example if the word string consists of two or more words one of which is the word assembly set extension unit or a fastener e.g. one of the exemplary terms listed in the list BOLT CLIP EXTENSION GROMMET LUG NUT RIVET SCREW STUD UNIT ASSEMBLY and SET the rules can be configured appropriately. For example if the word string includes fastener extension and or unit a rule can be configured to place the descriptor s in a descriptor field in the matching table. The rule can be configured to place fastener extension or unit in the item name field in the matching table. The rule can be configured to delete all words following the word fastener extension or unit. 

The rule can be configured so that if assembly or set is located in the word string all words following the word assembly or set are deleted. The word preceding assembly or set can be placed in the item name field. Other words e.g. all the remaining words can be placed in the descriptor fields. The rules can be configured to delete the word assembly or set. If one word remains the rule can be configured to treat the remaining word as the item name. For example the rule can be configured to place the remaining word in item name field of the matching table. The rule can be configured upon determining that assembly or set is the first word in the word string to delete assembly or set. 

The auditing system in some embodiments can determine whether the word string satisfies a condition associated with the predetermined item. If the word string satisfies the condition the auditing system can generate the translated item description. For example the auditing system can include rules e.g. tests for pattern recognition of standard part description patterns. For example the remaining string can be parsed to determine the presence of a primary item name. A primary item name is for example a bumper hood fender etc.

An exemplary listing of primary item names is AIR AXLE BED BEDSIDE BODY BRAKE BUMPER CABIN CLUTCH AIRCONDITIONER CONSOLE COWL DOOR EMISSION ENGINE EXHAUST FENDER FUEL GRILLE HEADLAMP HEATER HOOD QUARTERPANEL RADIATOR ROOF STEERING SUSPENSION TRANSMISSION TRUNK WASHER WHEEL WINDOW WINDSHIELD and WIPER. The rules can be configured to place the first match in the first descriptor field in the matching table. The rules can be configured upon determining there are two consecutive primary item names in the word string to treat the two words as a single primary item name. If for example there are two primary item name words in the string and they are not consecutive the rules can be configured to for a lack of information perform statistical estimates see e.g. .

If a primary item name exists in the word string the word sequence can be important. For example if the primary item name is the first word in the word string then the last word in the string may be the word string s item name. The rules can be configured to place the last word in the item name field in the matching table e.g. the CNHQPD Table . The words between the primary item name e.g. the first word in the string and the item name e.g. the last word in the word string can be placed in the second third fourth descriptor fields in the same sequence they are in the string.

If for example the primary item name is the last word in the string then the first word in the string may be the string s item name. The rules can be configured to place the first word of the string in the item name field in the matching table. The rules can be configured to place the rest of the words in sequence in the descriptor fields after the primary item name is placed in the first descriptor field.

If for example the primary item name is in the middle of the string the rules can be configured to treat the word to the right of it as the string s item name. The word can be placed in the item name field of the matching table. To the left all words can be placed in sequence in the descriptor fields after the primary item name is placed in first descriptor field. The rule can be configured to ignore all other words.

If a translated item description is not generated the auditing system can generate the translated item description based on a statistical estimation. The rules can be configured to estimate the correct answer based on statistical norms. For example if the remaining string does not have a primary item name the string has two non consecutive primary item names and or the string is made up of only primary item names the rules can be configured to place the last word in the string in the item name field and the other words in the descriptor fields in the sequence they appear in the string.

The predetermined items can include commas and or word pairs. For example all comas in the word string can be removed making sure that all words are separated by one space. is a diagram of an exemplary table that shows a list of combination words. The first column labeled First Word and the second column labeled Second Word list the two words of a word combination. The corresponding entry in the third column labeled Combined Word is the combination of the two words. For example if any of the word pairs shown in columns First Word and Second Word appear in the remaining word string even if not consecutive the words can be treated as one word as shown in the corresponding entry of the Combined Word column of table .

As shown in the auditing system compares the word string against a build table to generate a relationship between the one or more words of the word string the build table comprising one or more index words each index word being associated with index information. In the auditing system selects a word from the word string. If the word is an orientation word the word is placed at the front of the word string. If not if the remaining words match a list of preceding terms the preceding relationship is recorded . Otherwise if the remaining words match a list of anteceding terms the anteceding relationship is recorded . The process repeats if there are remaining untested words in the word string. Once all words are accounted for the string is matched . Otherwise if all words are not accounted for the auditing system tests non orientation words.

The sixth through thirteenth columns labeled Major Assembly Assembly A Sub Assembly B Sub Assembly Component Simple Component Support Structure Protector and Hardware Consumables consecutively provide information corresponding to build number. For example if the corresponding entry in the Dictionary column is associated with the words present if any in the entry for the Major Assembly column the build number is 8 if the corresponding entry in the Dictionary column is associated with the words present if any in the entry for the Assembly A column the build number is 7 and so on. The fourteenth column labeled Generic Build Number lists a generic build number for the corresponding entry in the Dictionary column. The fifteenth column labeled Generic Classification lists a classification for the corresponding entry in the Dictionary column.

For example the auditing system can categorize the index words as primarily noun adjective or orientation words based on the When Is A Noun When Is An Adjective and When Is An Orientation columns recognizing that some words can be both. The tested word can be processed differently depending on how the word is labeled. For example if the tested word is a noun the words that tend to precede the noun are listed in the When Is A Noun column. If for example the word never is in the When Is A Noun column then the tested word is not used as a noun. If the tested word is an adjective the words that tend to follow the adjective are listed in the When Is An Adjective column. If for example the word never is listed in the When Is An Adjective column then the tested word is not used as a adjective. If for example the word always and or all words is listed in the When Is An Adjective column then the tested word is usually used as a adjective for all words it appears with. The same can be true for the words in the When Is An Orientation column.

Tables similar to table can be generated for example based on the perspective of item names and descriptions. In some examples table is based on 1.5 million random item names and descriptions. For example word placement trends can be utilized to generate a table like table . For example if the word is primarily a noun then it will have a set of words that precede the noun e.g. superior to the noun in the relationship whereas if it is primarily an adjective it will have a group of words that normally follow the word within a word string e.g. inferior to the adjective in the relationship . Other word trends can include for example if the word is primarily a noun then the word will be the first word in the preceding word group. e.g. the reason for this is that there may be word groups under the noun category at times when the word is not primarily a noun .

If each word in the word string is tested using for example table the auditing system may find words in the word string where the word being tested is either a noun or an adjective thereby indicating whether it precedes or follows the word being tested. For example assume there is a word sting with A B C D where none of the words are orientation words. The auditing system can generate a string of relationships such as A C B C D C D B D. In order to satisfy all the relationships in this case the word string sequence must be A B C D where D is treated as the item name. A correct order of the words in the word string sequence can be determined by the order that correctly satisfies all the relationships in table . There can be as many relationships as there are words in the word string. Words tested and found to be orientation words can simply be held as orientation words that precede the word string.

Table provides a generic build number and noun adjective orientation categorization. The Generic Build Number column and the Generic Classification column provide the generic categorization. The Generic Classification column can be used to determine whether the word being tested is a Noun Adjective Orientation word. The Generic Build Number column for adjectives indicates the word should be treated as Descriptors. For nouns the Generic Build Number column provides a generic build number. Generic build numbers can represent for example 8 Major Assembly 7 Assembly 6 Sub Assembly 5 Sub Assembly Component 4 Simple Component 3 Single Pressed Rolled Cast Fiber Support Structure 2 Plastic Rubber Trim Molding Protector and 1 Hardware Consumables.

For orientation words the Generic Build Number column can indicate the word is an orientation word. Orientation words can be collected and placed at the front of the word string. Word strings with multiple nouns and descriptors can be sequenced to abide by the following statement after orientation words the highest build noun followed by the descriptor words followed last be the lowest build noun which is the item name. Parts can be described by what the part is attached to what the part is a part of and or what the part is located near. For example the lowest build number can be the item name.

The Major Assembly Assembly A Sub Assembly B Sub Assembly Component Simple Component Support Structure Protector and Hardware Consumables columns can indicate information for a customized Build Number. A noun it can be part of item names that reside at different levels in the build table. For example the word receiver can be a simple connector on a tow bar or it can be a receiver in a complex navigation system and therefore two different levels of number are supplied. These numbers can be determined by matching the words in the various columns between Major Assembly Assembly A Sub Assembly B Sub Assembly Component Simple Component Support Structure Protector and Hardware Consumables with other words besides the word being tested in the word string. For example if for the test the auditing system is using word receiver and other words in the word string are either navigation keyless entry or radio then receiver in this case is a sub assembly with the build number . If the other words in the word string had been frame hitch or bumper then receiver in this case is a sub assembly component with the build number . The build numbers collected for the word string from the Major Assembly Assembly A Sub Assembly B Sub Assembly Component Simple Component Support Structure Protector and Hardware Consumables columns are treated just as the numbers collected from the Generic Build Number column. In some examples however there is a slightly higher degree of accuracy with regard to the build level of each word in the Major Assembly Assembly A Sub Assembly B Sub Assembly Component Simple Component Support Structure Protector and Hardware Consumables columns.

For example assume a word string includes A B C D. Each word in the word string is tested. For example word A is tested by locating word A in the Dictionary column to identify the build row that pertains to information about this word. If the corresponding entry in the When Is An Orientation has an Always the test word A is an orientation word and it is positioned first in the word string. If it has a Never continue to the When is A Noun column. In the corresponding cell in the When is A Noun column determine if any of the words B C D are present. If any of the words are present they precede A or they are then A . If the relationships exist they are recorded for analysis otherwise the process continues.

For the corresponding entry in the When Is An Adjective column determine if any of the words B C D are present. If any of the words are present they follow or antecede A or they are then A. If the relationships exist they are recorded for analysis otherwise the process continues.

The process repeats as indicated above for words B C and D. The system determines whether all the words are accounted for by being related to one another. If all words are accounted for then the auditing system sequences the words to satisfy all relationships and places any orientation words in the front of the resulting word string. The translation can move to the identification step with the matching table See e.g. . If all words are not accounted for then the auditing system sequence the words to satisfy all relationships that exist and places any orientation words in the front of the resulting word string. The one or more words without a relationship i.e. non orientation words are placed at the end of the word string and processed as shown in .

In the auditing system selects a non orientation word from the word string. The selected word is tested for a build number. If a build number was not assigned the auditing system assigns a build number. The process repeats steps through for each remaining non orientation word to test. The auditing system arranges the word string. If the auditing system determines the word string does not have proper relationships the auditing system logs the word string. Otherwise the auditing system matches the word string see e.g. .

For example returning to the A B C D word string example each word besides orientation words are tested . if word A is a non orientation word A is tested by locating word A in the Dictionary column to identify the build row that pertains to information about word A. For the corresponding entries in the Major Assembly Assembly A Sub Assembly B Sub Assembly Component Simple Component Support Structure Protector and Hardware Consumables columns the auditing system determines if any of the words B C or D are present. If any of the words are present then test word A should be assigned the build number corresponding to the column where the cell match occurred. If no match occurred the auditing system assigns the generic build number of the corresponding entry in the Generic Build Number column.

The process above is repeated for each word B C or D that are non orientation words. The auditing system can determine whether all the words in the word string A B C D are properly identified. For example each word should be identified as an orientation word a noun with a build number or an adjective denoted as a build number. The auditing system can arrange the word string for example with any orientation words first any nouns with a number arranged highest to lowest where the lowest noun is the item name and any adjectives placed directly before the item name. The auditing system determines whether the relationships established in the first test e.g. are maintained with exception of the word s without relationships and the orientation words. If the relationships established in the first test are maintained with exception of the word s without relationships and the orientation words the auditing system matches with the matching table see e.g. . Otherwise the auditing system can log information of the word string in for example a bad translation log.

For example the matching information table e.g. the CNHQPD table representation of the translated item description is compared to an item description table with one or more matching rules in the auditing system . are diagrams of an exemplary table an item description table. shows columns one through six named CAT NAME SUB CAT NAME SUB SUB CAT NAME GENERIC PART ID MATCH COUNT and ORIENTATION respectively. The CAT NAME column includes the category name which for the rows in is AIR BAGS AIR BAG ELECTRICAL. The SUB CAT NAME column lists the sub category of the corresponding category name for each row. The two sub categories are AIR BAGS rows one through four and ELECTRICAL in rows five through six . The SUB SUB CAT NAME column lists the sub category of the corresponding sub category name for each row. The GENERIC PART ID column includes a generic part ID number for each row. The MATCH COUNT columns indicate the number of matches. The ORIENTATION column includes orientation words.

If there are any constraint word matches in constraint columns e.g. the Constraint Word column through the Constraint Word column of table then that row is not used in the temporary table for analysis. The matching rules takes the item name located in matching information table and searches for all matches in item name and alias columns of table e.g. from the orientation column through the descriptor alias column . The auditing system creates a temporary table for analysis of the information which consists of all the match rows found in table . These rows contain for example orientation orientation alias descriptor descriptor alias match indicator item name and item name alias information. The match indicator is a number of term matches for the particular row. The match percentage is calculated for each category of word. The percentage can be calculated for example by using the denominator as the count of orientation descriptor and item name words in the table description for the matching row and the numerator as the count of any matches that occur in any of the categories e.g. orientation descriptor descriptor alias item name item name alias .

The Match Count column in includes the minimum count for a match for the corresponding row. The matching rules can verify that the minimum has been achieved for each row based on the associated match indicator. If not the row may not be used in the match analysis. If the auditing system determines there is one match which full fills all the requirements of the minimum match level the match has no constraint words and there are no other candidates for the match the auditing system can associate the generic item identifier as the item translation. For example if a part name string is Right Front Impact Absorber the min count is three 3 and the actual count is one 1 for orientation one 1 for orientation alias one 1 for descriptor and one 1 for part name. There are no constraint words so the total count of four 4 indicates the part name string is a candidate item translation.

If the auditing system determines there are multiple matches with the same fulfillment requirements the matching rules can handle the situation appropriately. is a diagram of an exemplary table that lists generic item identifiers which can require associating multiple generic item identifiers with a particular word string. The first column column Index I contains a unique identifier for each row. The second through ninth columns labeled Col. A Col. B Col. C Col. D Col. E Col. F Col. G and Col. H respectively list generic identifiers. For example if a part name string is Axle Shaft the part name string has four candidates Front right axle shaft Front left axle shaft Rear right axle shaft and Rear left axle shaft. These four candidates are reported. If for example there is a match with the generic item identifier of the entry and table the customer can be provided with dual translations or any number of translations e.g. five translations . This can occur for example when an insurance estimator has not included orientation information to different between symmetrical part types e.g. right and left front fender etc. .

If no match can be found e.g. no word remains in the word string to match after the matching rules are complete the auditing system can log the description and indicate there is insufficient information for a translation. A list of exemplary words which should not be included in the word string during the matching steps is ANTIFREEZE APPLIQUE BADGE BALL BOLT BUCKLE BULB BUTTON CANISTER CHANNEL CLAMP CLIP CLOCK SPRING CLOCKSPRING DECAL EMBLEM FASTNER FLAP GASKET GROMMET GUIDE HANGER KNOB LABEL LETTER LOGO MUDGUARD NAMEPLATE NUT ORNAMENT RELAY RETAINER RIVET ROPE SCREW SEAL SEALER SHACKLE SHIM SNAP SPACER STAY STRAP STRIPE STUD U BOLT U BOLT WEDGE CAULK and SEALER. If for example the word string includes one or more words from this list the auditing system can log the description and indicate there is no translation possible due to the inclusion of one or more of the words in the list.

The following is an exemplary translation method using some of the rules discussed above. The following exemplary translation method is intended for illustrative purposes only 

 1 Treat the word string as a machine generated or user generated free text field and tested for a particular pattern of machine generated description using Table 1. If this machine pattern is present than run a rule that removes specific un needed words from the part word string. If the pattern exists then the truncated part word string moves to the next step. If this is not the case then the whole word string moves to the next step.

 2 Test the part word string for various types of punctuation characters to determine whether all characters are preceded by a space and followed by a space. If they are not then add spaces as needed to prepare the part word string for further processing. If punctuation characters don t exist then move the part word string to the next step. If the punctuation characters exist then the rule adds the necessary spaces and the word string will progress to the next step.

 3 Test the part word string for existence of standard terminology that has no real impact on the part being described using Table 2. If present in the part word string remove the terms. If the throw away terminology exists then the truncated part word string moves to the next step. Otherwise the whole word string moves to the next step.

 4 Test word string is tested for repair and finishing on door shells and panels. Look for specific word phrases included in for example the rules engine. If such word phrases don t exist then the part word string moves to the next step. If the word phrases do exist remove the necessary words and add the necessary words and move the word string to the next step.

 5 Test the word string for the presence of a form of cross member. Look for specific word phrases included in for example the rules engine. If the word form does not exist then move the part word string to the next step. If the word form does exist remove the necessary words and add the cross member identifier word and move to the next step.

 6 Determine if other things have been included with the part description that does not add value to the identification of the part. If other things have been included determine where and how many words are not required. If this is not the case move the part word string moves to the next step. Otherwise all words dealing with unnecessary other things are removed by the rules and the word string moves to the next step.

 7 If the part word string contains a description with the words heads up display attached the rules engine will make a determination if the heads up display is the part and if so move the item name and descriptor word to the matching table skipping all subsequent rules in between. If this is not the case then the part word string moves to the next step.

 8 Determine if the part word string contains the words sport suspension. If so remove all unnecessary words that hinder identification of the item name and its necessary orientation and descriptor words and move the remaining item name word string to the next step. Otherwise move the part word string to the next step.

 9 Determine if the part word string contains the words standard suspension. If so remove all unnecessary words that hinder identification of the item name and its necessary orientation and descriptor words and move the remaining item name word string to the next step. If this is not the case move the part word string to the next step.

 10 Determine if the part word string contains the words automatic or manual transmission. If so remove all unnecessary words that hinder identification of the item name and its necessary orientation and descriptor words and the remaining item name word string moves to the next step. Otherwise move the part word string moves to the next step.

 11 Determine if the word string contains consecutive words starting with the words manual and steering and followed by a word starting with co. If it does remove all unnecessary words that hinder identification of the item name and its necessary orientation and descriptor words and move the remaining item name word string to the next step. Otherwise move the part word string to the next step.

 12 If the part word string contains the word combination with an orientation abbreviation remove the abbreviation and replace it with a complete orientation word and move the part word string to the next step. Otherwise move the part word string to the next step.

 13 Address abbreviations containing both text and non text characters using table . If there is a match replace the words accordingly otherwise move the part word string to the next step.

 14 Identify if there are groupings of structural and sheet metal parts such as assembly clip structure section and sheet metal. Test for Clip Designator words in the word string scanning through table . If a match is found the remaining part of the word string is examined and replaced with the correct orientation descriptor and item name. Upon completion the replacement word string is loaded into the matching table e.g. the CNHQPD table skipping the remaining part of the process until the word string is tested against the item type list e.g. . Otherwise move the original part word string to the next step.

 15 If there are any abbreviations for without and with xxxx remove the abbreviations and the part of the word string following those abbreviations and continue to the next step. Otherwise move to the next step.

 16 Remove all metric indicators alpha numeric alpha and numerical characters dealing with metrics with exception of the following three representations 1st 2nd and 3rd using Table 4. If identified delete the word s from the part word string. If they are not present test for combinations of alpha numeric combinations and if found delete them from the part word string. Then continue to the next step.

 17 Test for computer generated formats with internal code notations and remove the superfluous computer generated custom codes if any. Then continue to the next step.

 18 Determine if there are any non alpha numeric characters in the word string and remove any non alpha numeric characters in the word string with the exception of comas. If parenthesizes are removed also remove all text and characters within the parenthesizes. If quotes are removed also remove all text within the quote. Continue to next step.

 20 Compare the text string shall be compared to table . Each group of letters separated by a space or single letter separated by a space shall be compared to all aliasing strings starting with the same first letter. Replace the group of letters or letter that was being tested with the first match and replace the group in the same sequence position as the original group of letters or letter in the text string. At the end of this iterative process all words should be resolved in the text string. If there is no match for a word in the string remove the word from the description and log it appropriately.

 21 If there is header e.g. CCC Header information look for a match in table . The rules determine if the header should be used or if it should be converted to different words or if it should be discarded. Continue to the next step.

 22 Determine if there are single letters within the remaining word string. Determine if the individual letter s are allowable and if not remove the letter s from the word string. Continue to the next step.

 23 Next determine if there are dual meaning words in the word string using table . If appropriate place the words in the matching table and move to the matching steps. The words do not have to be in sequence nor do they have to be the only words in the string to match. Otherwise continue.

 24 Determine if the word string contains the word TYPE. If the word string contains the word TYPE remove the word TYPE and all words following that word and continue. Otherwise continue without removing the word.

The exemplary translation method can proceed in multiple ways. Two exemplary method are discussed below. These examples are intended for illustrative purposes only and are not conclusive in any way. The output of example one and or example two can be input into a matching procedure e.g. the procedures shown in and the related description .

 1 If the word string contains any of the words listed in the list ANTIFREEZE APPLIQUE BADGE BALL BOLT BUCKLE BULB BUTTON CANISTER CHANNEL CLAMP CLIP CLOCK SPRING CLOCKSPRING DECAL EMBLEM FASTNER FLAP GASKET GROMMET GUIDE HANGER KNOB LABEL LETTER LOGO MUDGUARD NAMEPLATE NUT ORNAMENT RELAY RETAINER RIVET ROPE SCREW SEAL SEALER SHACKLE SHIM SNAP SPACER STAY STRAP STRIPE STUD U BOLT U BOLT WEDGE CAULK and SEALER terminate the translation and do not attempt to match the word string with item identifiers. If this is not the case continue on in sequence.

 2 If at any time from this point in the sequence to the end of the sequence analysis of the word string the word string is represented by a single word that word shall be deemed the item name and move to the matching table.

 5 Check the word string for orientation words that describe the location or placement of the part using for example the list BACK BACKWARD BOTTOM CENTER DRIVER DRIVERSIDE FLEET FORWARD FRONT INNER LEFT LOWER MIDDLE OUTER PASSENGER PASSENGERSIDE REAR RIGHT SIDE STEP UNDER UP and UPPER. If there are word matches move the words to the matching table. Remove the orientation words from the word string and continue in sequence. If this is not the case continue in sequence.

 7 If the word string has the first and or the second word delineated by a coma then identify the first and or word s in the string is the item name unless the word is assembly or set. If the word preceding the coma is assembly or set delete the word assembly or set. If there is a word that was preceding assembly or set it is the item name and all other words are descriptors. If the word preceding the coma is not assembly or set the word preceding the coma should be the item name and should be loaded into the item name field in the matching table. The other word is the first descriptor and the remainder of the string should be loaded into the following descriptor fields in their present sequence. Remove all comas in the word string at the completion of this step. The rules verify that all words are separated by just one space at the end of this step. Move to step that looks for HyperQuest ID part match. If there were no comas continue in sequence.

 8 If the word string consists of two or more words one of which is the word assembly set extension unit or a fastener e.g. one of the exemplary terms listed in the list BOLT CLIP EXTENSION GROMMET LUG NUT RIVET SCREW STUD UNIT ASSEMBLY and SET 8a in the case of fastener extension or unit place the descriptor s in a descriptor field in the matching table and place fastener extension or unit in the item name field in the matching table. All words following the word fastener extension or unit are deleted. 8b In the case of assembly or set all words following the word assembly or set are deleted. The word preceding assembly or set should be placed in the item name field and all other words placed in the descriptor fields. Delete the word assembly or set . If one word remains treat it as the item name and place it in item name field of the matching table. If assembly or set is the first word in the word string delete assembly or set and continue in sequence. If this is not the case continue in sequence. If this is not the case continue in sequence.

 9a If the primary item name is the first word in the string then the last word in the string is in the string s item name and should be placed in the item name field in the matching table. The words between the primary item name first in the string and the item name last in the string should be placed in the second third fourth descriptor fields in the same sequence they are in the string. Move to matching steps. If this is not the case continue in sequence.

 9b If the primary item name is the last word in the string then the first word in the string is the string s item name. Place the first word of the string in the item name field in the matching table. The rest of the words can be placed in sequence in the descriptor fields after the primary item name is placed in the first descriptor field. Move to matching steps. If this is not the case continue in sequence.

 9c If the primary item name is in the middle of the string the word to the right of it is the string s item name and should be placed in the item name field of the matching table. To the left all words can be placed in sequence in the descriptor fields after the primary item name is placed in first descriptor field. All other words should be ignored. Move to matching steps.

 9d If information is lacking then estimate the correct answer based on statistical norms. The remaining string does not have a primary item name or it has two non consecutive primary item names or it is made up of only primary item names. Therefore place the last word in the string in the item name field and the other words in the descriptor fields in the sequence they appear in the string. Move to matching steps.

 9e If one word remains or one word and orientation words only check table for that word and move to lack of information step that does not provide a translation or continue in sequence accordingly.

The above described techniques can be implemented in digital and or analog electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. The implementation can be as a computer program product i.e. a computer program tangibly embodied in a machine readable storage device for execution by or to control the operation of a data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer and or multiple computers. A computer program can be written in any form of computer or programming language including source code compiled code interpreted code and or machine code and the computer program can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a subroutine element or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one or more sites.

Method steps can be performed by one or more processors executing a computer program to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and or generating output data. Method steps can also be performed by and an apparatus can be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a FPGA field programmable gate array a FPAA field programmable analog array a CPLD complex programmable logic device a PSoC Programmable System on Chip ASIP application specific instruction set processor or an ASIC application specific integrated circuit . Subroutines can refer to portions of the computer program and or the processor special circuitry that implement one or more functions.

Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include by way of example both general and special purpose microprocessors and any one or more processors of any kind of digital or analog computer. Generally a processor receives instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and or data. Generally a computer also includes or is operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to or both one or more mass storage devices for storing data e.g. magnetic magneto optical disks or optical disks. Data transmission and instructions can also occur over a communications network. Information carriers suitable for embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of volatile and non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. DRAM SRAM EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and optical disks e.g. CD DVD HD DVD and Blu ray disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.

To provide for interaction with a user the above described techniques can be implemented on a computer in communication with a display device e.g. a CRT cathode ray tube plasma or LCD liquid crystal display monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device e.g. a mouse a trackball a touchpad or a motion sensor by which the user can provide input to the computer e.g. interact with a user interface element . Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user can be received in any form including acoustic speech or tactile input.

The above described techniques can be implemented in a distributed computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server and or a middleware component e.g. an application server and or a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface and or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an example implementation or any combination of such back end middleware or front end components.

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and a server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other.
