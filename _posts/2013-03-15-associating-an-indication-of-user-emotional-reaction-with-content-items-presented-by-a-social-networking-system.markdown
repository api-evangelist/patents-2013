This invention relates generally to social networking systems and in particular to providing an indication of a user s opinion regarding content presented by a social networking system.

Social networks or social utilities that track and enable connections between users including people businesses and other entities have become prevalent in recent years. In particular a social network system allows users to more efficiently communicate information to other users of the social networking system. Typically social networking systems maintain connections among their users and identify content likely to be relevant to their users. Social networking systems also collect and maintain information about their users. Examples of information about users maintained by a social networking system include static information such as geographic location employer job type age music preferences and interests or dynamic information describing user interactions. Additionally many social networking systems notify a user of actions performed by other users connected to the user.

Performing actions communicated to the social networking system allows social networking system users to interact with each other or with objects maintained by the social networking system. For example users may post comments to pages associated with other users view images view video data listen to audio data or perform other actions on various objects maintained by the social networking system. Actions performed by a user are frequently distributed to additional users connected to the user who performed the action. When interacting with other users or objects users may seek to indicate their opinion or emotions toward the objects or users. For example users may seek to indicate they dislike a post that a post made them laugh or that a post made them cry. While users may post written comments expressing opinions towards an object an action performed by another user or another user it is difficult for a user to clearly convey emotion through written comments.

Embodiments of the invention enable users to convey emotions towards various objects maintained by a social networking system by associating one or more emotion icons emoticons or emojis with objects maintained by the social networking system. For example if a user likes an object in the social networking system the user associates an emoji representing a thumbs up with the post or if the user dislikes the object the user associates an emoji representing a thumbs down. The emoji associated with a post are displayed along with the content of the post to other users.

In one embodiment a user requests to associate an emoji with an object presented to the user by the social networking system. For example the user requests to associate an emoji with a story included in a newsfeed presented to the user. Based on the request the social networking system may present the user with one or more emoji to associate with the object and the user selects an emoji from the presented emoji. In one embodiment the social networking system prompts the user for payment information to associate a selected emoji with the object. The selected emoji is associated with the object and a connection or other information between the user and the object identifying the selected emoji is stored by the social networking system.

Emoji associated with an object may be displayed to other users along with the object. For example if users have associated multiple emoji with content included in a post such as a story one or more of the emoji are displayed along with the content. Additionally each emoji may be displayed along with an identifier of the user associating the emoji with the post. Further emoji associated with an object may be used when selecting objects for presentation to a user or for ordering objects presented to a user.

The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

A client device is a device capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or laptop computer. In another embodiment a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smart phone or a similar device. In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user using the client device to interact with the social networking system . For example a client device executes a browser application to allow interaction between the client device and the social networking system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API that runs on the native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. Thus the network may include communication channels using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

The social networking system comprises one or more computing devices storing information about users and objects as well as information describing connections between various users and objects. Additionally the social networking system may provide content to one or more users based on information about the users maintained by the social networking system . In various embodiments the social networking system is one or more servers accessible by client devices via the network . The social networking system is further described below in conjunction with .

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each data field describing one or more attributes of the corresponding user of the social networking system . Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. Further examples of information provided by the user include posts communicated to the social networking system from a client device . Posts may include data such as status updates or other textual data location information photos videos links music or other similar data and or media and are associated with the user profile of the posting user. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with identification information of users of the social networking system displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the object store and stored in the action log .

The object store stores objects each representing various types of content. For example the object store stores a data structure including data for each object having information fields describing characteristics of the objects. Different data structures may be stored for different types of objects. For example for event type objects the object store includes data structures specifying the time and location for an event. When a new object of a particular type is created the social networking system initializes a new data structure of the appropriate type assigns a unique object identifier to the data structure and adds data to the data structure as needed. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Social networking system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the social networking system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. 

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user among others. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links and checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event to a calendar joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as with other applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the social networking system . For example an e commerce website that primarily sells sporting equipment at bargain prices may recognize a user of a social networking system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as this sporting equipment retailer may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the social networking system to the social networking system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system.

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and object or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the social networking system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object interest and other users in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s interest for an object interest or other user in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

Data stored in the user profile store the object store action log and the edge store allows the social networking system to generate a social graph where nodes represent objects or users and edges represent connections between nodes identifying relationships between users and or objects. An edge between two nodes in the social graph represents a particular kind of connection between the users or objects corresponding to each of the nodes which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. Maintaining a social graph allows the social networking system to readily identify relationships between various objects and or users.

In one embodiment the social networking system identifies stories likely to be of interest to a user through a newsfeed presented to the user. A story presented to a user describes an action taken by an additional user connected to the user and identifies the additional user. In some embodiments a story describing an action performed by a user may be accessible to users not connected to the user that performed the action. The newsfeed manager may generate stories for presentation to a user based on information in the action log and in the edge store or may select candidate stories included in the object store . One or more of the candidate stories are selected and presented to a user by the newsfeed manager .

For example the newsfeed manager receives a request to present one or more stories to a social networking system user. The newsfeed manager accesses one or more of the user profile store the object store the action log and the edge store to retrieve information about the identified user. For example stories or other data associated with users connected to the identified user are retrieved. The retrieved stories or other data are analyzed by the newsfeed manager to identify content likely to be relevant to the identified user. For example stories associated with users not connected to the identified user or stories associated with users for which the identified user has less than a threshold affinity are discarded as candidate stories. Based on various criteria the newsfeed manager selects one or more of the candidate stories for presentation to the identified user.

In various embodiments the newsfeed manager presents stories to a user through a newsfeed including a plurality of stories selected for presentation to the user. The newsfeed may include a limited number of stories or may include a complete set of candidate stories. The number of stories included in a newsfeed may be determined in part by a user preference included in user profile store . The newsfeed manager may also determine the order in which selected stories are presented via the newsfeed. For example the newsfeed manager determines that a user has a highest affinity for a specific user and increases the number of stories in the newsfeed associated with the specific user or modifies the positions in the newsfeed where stories associated with the specific user are presented.

The newsfeed manager may also account for actions by a user indicating a preference for types of stories and selects stories having the same or similar types for inclusion in the newsfeed. Additionally newsfeed manager may analyze stories received by social networking system from various users to obtain information about user preferences or actions from the analyzed stories. This information may be used to refine subsequent selection of stories for newsfeeds presented to various users.

In one embodiment the social networking system includes an emoji store including information describing icons or images representing various emotional states or other information. These icons or images are referred to herein as emoji. Emoji may be static images or may be animated images. For example an emoji may include a cartoon character crying including a pair of animated tears coming out of the character s eyes. The emoji store includes data describing various emoji and may include additional information such as pricing or availability of some emoji. In one embodiment information describing the emoji is included in the object store .

In one embodiment a group of emoji are available to users for free while additional emoji may be obtained by the user by providing compensation to the social networking system . For example a basic set of emoji are available for free while more complex or detailed emoji may be acquired in exchange for compensation to the social networking system . For example a basic set of emoji are static images while premium emojis are animated images. In other embodiments a user provides compensation to the social networking system before having access to any emoji alternatively all emoji in the emoji store are accessible without providing compensation to the social networking system .

In one embodiment compensating the social networking system allows a user to associate an emoji with objects a limited number of times or for a limited period of time. In other embodiments compensating the social networking system allows the user to associate the emoji with objects for an unlimited length of time or an unlimited number of times. For example compensating the social networking system allows the user to associate an emoji with a limited number of objects. A user may compensate the social networking system to associate a set or bundle of emoji with objects. For example a user may purchase association of 5 emojis with objects for 5 dollars. In other embodiments the social networking system provides users with access to emoji through a subscription where the user compensate the social networking system at specified intervals to associate various emoji with objects. For example a user provides the social networking system with a monthly fee of 5 dollars to associate up to 10 emoji with objects per month. In both embodiments the emojis made available to the user may be single use emojis limited time use emojis limited time period emojis or unlimited usage emojis.

In some embodiments an emoji subscription allows a user to associate any emoji covered by the subscription with one or more objects an unlimited number of times while the subscription is valid. This allows a user to associate emojis from a specific category or group with objects. For example the social networking system offers a subscription providing users with access to emoji related to a specific cartoon character and allowing users purchasing the subscription to associate any emoji related to the cartoon character with objects for the duration of the subscription. In one embodiment the subscription allows the user to access newly added emoji related to the category or group encompassed by the subscription.

One or more emojis included in the emoji store may be are sponsored or subsidized by advertisers or other entities. In one embodiment access to sponsored emoji is limited to users having a connection with the advertiser or entity via the social networking system . For example a movie production studio may sponsor emojis featuring characters from a movie that is about to be released or that has been recently released. Users connected to a page in the social networking system associated with the movie or with the movie production studio may have access to associate the sponsored emoji with objects. The entity sponsoring emojis may compensate the social networking system when a user connected to the sponsoring entity associates a sponsored emoji with an object. In other embodiments an entity may provide a portion of the compensation to the social networking system when a user associates an emoji sponsored by the entity with an object while the user provides another portion of the compensation to the social networking system .

External systems such as external websites may provide emoji to the social networking system for storage in the emoji store . An external system may specify the amount of compensation to be received by the social networking system to allow a user to associate emoji from the external system with posts. The social networking system may receive the compensation and communicate the received compensation to the external system. In some embodiments the social networking system charges an additional fee to the user for associating emoji with objects or charges the external system a fee for providing emoji to users. Hence the social networking system may retain a portion of the compensation provided by a user for associating emoji provided by an external publisher with objects.

The emoji association module receives requests from users to associate emoji with objects maintained by the social networking system and associates emoji selected by a user with an object. When the emoji association module receives a request to associate emoji with an object the emoji association module presents one or more emoji from the emoji store to the user. When a user selects an emoji the emoji association module determines if compensation is to be received to associate the selected emoji with an object and obtains payment information from the user if compensation is to be received. The emoji association module also stores a connection between the selected emoji the object and the user in the edge store . Association of emoji with an object maintained by the social networking system is further described below in conjunction with .

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices . The web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and one or more client devices for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information for example images or videos that are stored in the object store . Additionally the web server may provide API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID or RIM .

In a user requests one or more newsfeed stories from the social networking system using a client device . When the social networking system receives the request the newsfeed generator selects one or more newsfeed stories such as the stories determined to be most relevant to the user and sends the selected stories to the client device . Upon receiving the selected stories the client device displays the selected stories to the user .

The user may elect to associate an emoji with one of the displayed stories to indicate the user s opinion or emotion toward the story. To associate an emoji with the story the user requests emoji accessible to the user. The social networking system receives the request and retrieves emoji available to the user which are sent to the client device. For example the social networking system identifies groups of emoji the user has provided compensation to the social networking system for accessing and or identifies emoji that the user is otherwise enabled to associate with objects. For example the user accesses an interface element in a story to request emoji from the social networking system and the emoji eligible for use by the user are received from the social networking system and displayed along with the story.

From the displayed emoji the user selects an emoji to associate with the story and the social networking system receives an identification of the selected emoji. The social networking system determines if compensation is needed for the user to associate the selected emoji with the story. If the social networking system receives compensation to associate the selected emoji with the story the social networking system requests payment information from the user . The client device receives the request for compensation and prompts the user to provide payment information. Payment information provided by the user to the client device is sent to the social networking system . When the social networking system receives the payment information the social networking system associates the selected emoji with the story. In one embodiment the emoji is displayed along with the story to the user and additional users connected to the user may be notified that the user associated the selected emoji with the story.

When the viewing user interacts with the interface element to associate one or more emoji with a content item one or more emoji eligible to be selected by the viewing user are displayed . In the example shown by the emoji eligible for selection by the viewing user are displayed in an emoji selector an additional example of which is shown in . In one embodiment emoji eligible for selection by the viewing user are displayed in the emoji selector as an array or grid. Alternatively the emoji selector displays one or more categories or themes and displays emoji eligible for selection by the viewing user and associated with a selected category or theme. For example the emoji selector displays a list including smiley face emojis sad face emojis and other categories of emoji. The viewing user selects a category of emoji from the list and the emoji selector displays an array or grid of emoji included in the selected category. In another embodiment the emoji selector directs the viewing users to a webpage or another source for selecting emoji.

In some embodiments the emoji selector may present emojis to the viewing user based on the contents of the content item to be associated with an emoji. For example if a content item includes a positive review of a superhero movie the emoji selector may display emojis including characters from the superhero movie. Additionally the social networking system may access stored information associated with the viewing user such as emoji previously associated with content items by the viewing user and select emoji displayed to the viewing user based on the information associated with the viewing user. The emoji selector may alternatively display a specified number of most frequently selected emoji e.g. the 10 most popular emojis during the last 7 days .

If the viewing user selects an emoji for which compensation is needed to associate the emoji with the content item the social networking system prompts the viewing user for payment information e.g. credit card number bank account number etc . shows an example user interface for the viewing user providing payment information to the social networking system . In one embodiment the social networking system stores previously received payment information for another emoji and allows the viewing user to select the stored payment information . As shown in the user interface includes an interface element for confirming purchase of the emoji and or an interface element for cancelling purchase of the emoji.

After receiving payment information from the viewing user the social networking system displays the selected emoji along with the content item to additional users of the social networking system connected to the viewing user. Information identifying the user associating the emoji with the content item may be displayed along with the emoji in some embodiments. For example as shown in a profile picture of the viewing user associating an emoji with a content item is displayed to users connected to the viewing user along with the content item and emoji shows an example of a user interface where profile pictures of multiple users associating emoji with a content item are displayed along with the content item and emoji when the content item is viewed by users connected to one or more of the users that associated emoji with the content item.
