title: Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation devices and methods to treat or avert atrial fibrillation
abstract: Energy is transmitted noninvasively to a patient using electrode-based stimulation devices or magnetic stimulation devices that are designed to non-invasively stimulate nerves selectively. The devices produce impulses that are used to treat atrial fibrillation, by stimulating a vagus nerve of a patient. The devices are also used to forecast the imminent onset of atrial fibrillation and then avert it by stimulating a vagus nerve.

This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 585 668 filed Jan. 12 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The field of the present invention relates to the delivery of energy impulses and or fields to bodily tissues for therapeutic or for prophylactic purposes. It relates more specifically to the use of non invasive devices and methods for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and magnetic nerve stimulation in order to treat or avert atrial fibrillation AF in a patient using energy that is delivered by such devices. According to the invention a patient who is experiencing AF or who is at risk for developing AF is monitored preferably using ambulatory or noninvasive sensors signals from the sensors are analyzed in order to design produce or adjust parameters of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or magnetic nerve stimulation of a patient preferably of a vagus nerve and the stimulation is intended to avert prevent delay abort shorten or ameliorate the AF.

The use of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions has been well known in the art for nearly two thousand years. It has been recognized that electrical stimulation of the brain and or the peripheral nervous system and or direct stimulation of the malfunctioning tissue holds significant promise for the treatment of many ailments because such stimulation is generally a wholly reversible and non destructive treatment.

One of the most successful applications of modern understanding of the electrophysiological relationship between muscle and nerves is the cardiac pacemaker. Although origins of the cardiac pacemaker extend back into the 1800 s it was not until 1950 that the first practical albeit external and bulky pacemaker was developed. The first truly functional wearable pacemaker appeared in 1957 and in 1960 the first fully implantable pacemaker was developed.

Around this time it was also found that electrical leads could be connected to the heart through veins which eliminated the need to open the chest cavity and attach the lead to the heart wall. In 1975 the introduction of the lithium iodide battery prolonged the battery life of a pacemaker from a few months to more than a decade. The modern pacemaker can treat a variety of different signaling pathologies in the cardiac muscle and can serve as a defibrillator as well see U.S. Pat. No. 6 738 667 to DENO et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference .

Another application of electrical stimulation of nerves has been the treatment of radiating pain in the lower extremities by stimulating the sacral nerve roots at the bottom of the spinal cord see U.S. Pat. No. 6 871 099 to WHITEHURST et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference .

Many such therapeutic applications of electrical stimulation involve the surgical implantation of electrodes within a patient. In contrast devices used for the medical procedures that are disclosed here stimulate nerves by transmitting energy to nerves and tissue non invasively thereby offering the patient an option that does not involve surgery. A medical procedure is defined as being non invasive when no break in the skin or other surface of the body such as a wound bed is created through use of the method and when there is no contact with an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice e.g. beyond the mouth or beyond the external auditory meatus of the ear . Such non invasive procedures are distinguished from invasive procedures including minimally invasive procedures in that invasive procedures do involve inserting a substance or device into or through the skin or into an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice. For example transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS is non invasive because it involves attaching electrodes to the surface of the skin or using a form fitting conductive garment without breaking the skin. In contrast percutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve is minimally invasive because it involves the introduction of an electrode under the skin via needle puncture of the skin see commonly assigned co pending US Patent Application 2010 0241188 entitled Percutaneous Electrical Treatment of Tissue to ERRICO et al which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Potential advantages of non invasive medical methods and devices relative to comparable invasive procedures are as follows. The patient may be more psychologically prepared to experience a procedure that is non invasive and may therefore be more cooperative resulting in a better outcome. Non invasive procedures may avoid damage of biological tissues such as that due to bleeding infection skin or internal organ injury blood vessel injury and vein or lung blood clotting. Non invasive procedures generally present fewer problems with biocompatibility. In cases involving the attachment of electrodes non invasive methods have less of a tendency for breakage of leads and the electrodes can be easily repositioned if necessary. Non invasive methods are sometimes painless or only minimally painful and may be performed without the need for even local anesthesia. Less training may be required for use of non invasive procedures by medical professionals. In view of the reduced risk ordinarily associated with non invasive procedures some such procedures may be suitable for use by the patient or family members at home or by first responders at home or at a workplace. Furthermore the cost of non invasive procedures may be reduced relative to comparable invasive procedures.

Non invasive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS electrodes were developed originally for treating different types of pain including pain in a joint or lower back cancer pain post operative pain post traumatic pain and pain associated with labor and delivery. As TENS was being developed to treat pain non invasive electrical stimulation using body surface electrodes was simultaneously developed for additional therapeutic or diagnostic purposes which are known collectively as electrotherapy. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation NMES stimulates normally innervated muscle in an effort to augment strength and endurance of normal e.g. athletic or damaged e.g. spastic muscle. Functional electrical stimulation FES is used to activate nerves innervating muscle affected by paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury head injury stroke and other neurological disorders or muscle affected by foot drop and gait disorders. FES is also used to stimulate muscle as an orthotic substitute e.g. replace a brace or support in scoliosis management. Another application of surface electrical stimulation is chest to back stimulation of tissue such as emergency defibrillation and cardiac pacing. Surface electrical stimulation has also been used to repair tissue by increasing circulation through vasodilation by controlling edema by healing wounds and by inducing bone growth. Surface electrical stimulation is also used for iontophoresis in which electrical currents drive electrically charged drugs or other ions into the skin usually to treat inflammation and pain arthritis wounds or scars.

Stimulation with surface electrodes may also be used to evoke a response for diagnostic purposes for example in peripheral nerve stimulation PNS which evaluates the ability of motor and sensory nerves to conduct and produce reflexes. Surface electrical stimulation is also used in electroconvulsive therapy to treat psychiatric disorders electroanesthesia for example to prevent pain from dental procedures and electrotactile speech processing to convert sound into tactile sensation for the hearing impaired. All of the above mentioned applications of surface electrode stimulation are intended not to damage the patient but if higher currents are used with special electrodes electrosurgery may be performed as a means to cut coagulate desiccate or fulgurate tissue Mark R. PRAUSNITZ. The effects of electric current applied to skin A review for transdermal drug delivery. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 18 1996 395 425 .

Another form of non invasive electrical stimulation is magnetic stimulation. It involves the induction by a time varying magnetic field of electrical fields and current within tissue in accordance with Faraday s law of induction. Magnetic stimulation is non invasive because the magnetic field is produced by passing a time varying current through a coil positioned outside the body inducing at a distance an electric field and electric current within electrically conducting bodily tissue. The electrical circuits for magnetic stimulators are generally complex expensive and use a high current impulse generator that may produce discharge currents of 5 000 amps or more which is passed through the stimulator coil to produce a magnetic pulse. The principles of electrical nerve stimulation using a magnetic stimulator along with descriptions of medical applications of magnetic stimulation are reviewed in Chris HOVEY and Reza Jalinous The Guide to Magnetic Stimulation The Magstim Company Ltd Spring Gardens Whitland Carmarthenshire SA34 0HR United Kingdom 2006.

Despite its attractiveness non invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is not always possible or practical. This is primarily because the stimulators may not be able to stimulate a deep nerve selectively or without producing excessive pain because the stimulation may unintentionally stimulate nerves other than the nerve of interest including nerves that cause pain. For this reason forms of electrical stimulation other than TENS may be best suited for the treatment of particular types of pain Paul F. WHITE Shitong Li and Jen W. Chiu. Electroanalgesia Its Role in Acute and Chronic Pain Management. Anesth Analg 92 2001 505 13 . Accordingly there remains a long felt but unsolved need to stimulate nerves totally non invasively selectively and essentially without producing pain.

As compared with what would be experienced by a patient undergoing non invasive stimulation with conventional TENS or magnetic stimulation methods the stimulators disclosed herein produce relatively little pain for a given depth of stimulus penetration but nevertheless stimulate the target nerve to achieve therapeutic results. Or conversely for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient e.g. the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins the stimulators disclosed herein achieve a greater depth of penetration or power of the stimulus under the skin. When some nerves are stimulated electrically they may produce undesirable responses in addition to the therapeutic effect that is intended. For example the stimulated nerves may produce unwanted muscle twitches. The stimulators disclosed herein selectively produce only the intended therapeutic effect when they are used to stimulate the target nerve.

The stimulators disclosed here are particularly useful for performing noninvasive stimulation of a vagus nerve in the neck. Invasive vagus nerve stimulation VNS also known as vagal nerve stimulation was developed initially for the treatment of partial onset epilepsy and was subsequently developed for the treatment of depression and other disorders. In those applications the left vagus nerve is ordinarily stimulated at a location within the neck by first surgically implanting an electrode there then connecting the electrode to an electrical stimulator U.S. Pat.

Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2009 2009 4631 4634 Timothy B. MAPSTONE. Vagus nerve stimulation current concepts. Neurosurg Focus 25 3 2008 E9 pp. 1 4 . An advantage of devices according to the present invention is that they can be used to perform VNS noninvasively on the neck and other locations without causing pain or nonselective nerve stimulation.

The devices disclosed here could also be used to treat epilepsy or depression but the present invention is directed to the use of noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation to treat or prevent a different disorder having a sudden onset namely atrial fibrillation AF . AF is a cardiac rhythm disturbance in which the duration of successive heartbeats ventricular contractions is apparently random or irregularly irregular . In most cases low amplitude oscillations f waves or fibrillations of the atrium also appear on the patient s electrocardiogram. In contrast to a normal heart rhythm normal sinus rhythm which exhibits variability of heartbeat duration that is due to exercise respiration changes in posture and the like the duration of a heartbeat in AF is typically independent of the durations of previous and successive heartbeats for many patients. In newly diagnosed AF an abnormally fast heart rate of 100 to 160 beats per minute is also common.

Although AF is not an immediately life threatening arrhythmia and some 30 40 of patients with AF may not complain of any symptoms many patients with AF may experience considerable discomfort with complaints of a racing heart rate palpitations or chest pain shortness of breath especially on exertion fatigue and or light headedness. More than 2.3 million individuals experience AF in the United States. Its prevalence increases with age such that approximately 10 of all individuals over the age of 80 have AF. The total cost for hospital admissions and office visits for AF in the United States in 2005 was 6.65 billion dollars which is projected to increase along with the increasing number of elderly individuals in the population.

The greatest danger to the AF patient is the significantly increased likelihood of a stroke due to the tendency of clots to form in their poorly contracting atria. It is estimated that 20 25 of all strokes are caused by AF and they are more severe than those caused by other factors. Other than strokes the greatest risk to the AF patient is that rapid heart rate caused by AF can lead to cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction which in turn can promote AF in a vicious cycle. Thus more than 40 of individuals who experience AF will also experience congestive heart failure sometime in their lives. Even after accounting for such coexisting cardiovascular conditions an individual with AF has an increased likelihood of premature death.

The AF of some patients may have a recognized cause that is temporary correctable or avoidable such as alcohol consumption or hyperthyroidism. However most cases of AF cannot be attributed to a particular set of causes and are treated accordingly. Currently major goals in the treatment of AF are the prevention of stroke usually with the aid of anticoagulation medications and the relief of symptoms such as rapid heart rate. This is preferably accomplished by terminating the AF or treating the symptoms if conversion to normal sinus rhythm is not successful.

If a decision is made to attempt to convert AF into a normal heart rhythm noninvasive pharmacological and transthoracic electrical shock methods have been developed to do so. In more than 90 percent of cases a normal heart rhythm can be restored shortly with such a cardioversion. However more than 70 percent of the patients will again experience AF within a year of the cardioversion if they are not placed on antiarrhythmic drugs for heart rhythm control and even then a significant number of patients relapse into AF. Furthermore the potential benefit of maintaining normal heart rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs is negated by potential adverse effects of those drugs including increased mortality. Therefore invasive methods for terminating the AF have also been developed for patients with recurrent or persistent AF that cannot be treated adequately by noninvasive pharmacological or electrical cardioversion. These invasive methods include radiofrequency catheter ablation of ectopic foci within the atria that may be responsible for the AF and the placement of multiple surgical lesions in the atrium to compartmentalize the atria into regions that cannot support AF Fred MORADY and Douglas P. Zipes. Atrial Fibrillation Clinical Features Mechanisms and Management. Chapter 40 in Braunwald s Heart Disease A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine 9th ed. 2011 Robert O. Bonow Douglas L. Mann Douglas P. Zipes and Peter Libby eds. Philadelphia Saunders pp. 825 844 .

Partial denervation of the vagus or other autonomic nerves has sometimes also been used to treat AF ordinarily in conjunction with invasive ablation on or around an ectopic focus e.g. circumferential isolation of the pulmonary vein. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has been proposed as another treatment for AF which would have an advantage over vagus denervation in that effects of stimulation would generally not be irreversible. However vagus nerve stimulation as an intervention for AF has only been attempted invasively and only in animal experiments that may not be a good model of AF in humans.

At one time electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve especially the right vagus nerve was considered to invariably exacerbate the dangers of AF. In fact electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve has long been used to induce AF in animals. However data from recent animal experiments indicate that vagus nerve stimulation might also be protective against AF provided that parameters of the nerve stimulation are properly selected ZHANG Y Mazgalev T N. Arrhythmias and vagus nerve stimulation. Heart Fail Rev 16 2 2011 147 61 . Such animal experiments demonstrate that if the intensity of right or bilateral vagus nerve stimulation is below that which would ordinarily produce a slowing of the normal heart rate the stimulation might prevent or terminate AF and it may even inhibit or reverse progressive changes in the heart that are associated with the progression from paroxysmal to permanent AF LI S Scherlag B J Yu L Sheng X Zhang Y Ali R Dong Y Ghias M Po S S.

The present invention is intended to address several impediments to the development of those observations from animal experimentation into a useful AF treatment for humans. First it increases the number and types of individuals for whom vagus nerve stimulation might be undertaken as a potential treatment for AF for the following reasons. Some patients in whom a vagus nerve electrode has already been implanted in connection with the treatment of epilepsy or depression might also be candidates for treatment of AF by vagus nerve stimulation. Although the patient s electrode would ordinarily have been implanted to stimulate the left vagus nerve rather than the right vagus nerve that may be more suitable for treatment of AF stimulation of the previously implanted electrode may nevertheless be effective for treating AF provided that parameters of the stimulation protocol are selected according to methods that are disclosed here. However the general population of AF patients would prefer non invasive vagus nerve stimulation to the surgical implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator especially if the non invasive stimulator produces little or no pain and does not generate unwanted side effects but nevertheless stimulates the vagus nerve to achieve the intended therapeutic results. Individuals with paroxysmal AF may be particularly disinclined to undergo the implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator solely for the treatment of a medical problem that arises only intermittently. Furthermore the present invention contemplates the use of non invasive vagal nerve stimulation as a prophylaxis against imminent AF rather than only treating AF that is in progress. Thus an individual who is disinclined to undergo the implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator for purposes of AF treatment would be even more disinclined to undergo its implantation only for purposes of AF prophylaxis.

Second the present invention addresses the problem of selecting nerve stimulation parameters on an individualized basis for the treatment of AF. For example in the above cited animal experiments vagus nerves were stimulated at a fixed frequency 20 Hz . However as disclosed herein it may be more effective to stimulate the vagus nerve at a frequency that is motivated by the frequency of fibrillation of the patient s atria as reflected in f waves in the patient s electrocardiogram. Furthermore because the frequency of fibrillation of the atria may fluctuate the present invention contemplates the use of feedback and feed forward methods to continuously adapt the parameters of the stimulation to the changing electrophysiological properties of the patient s heart.

A third problem that the present invention addresses is the avoidance of episodes of AF in patients who are at risk for experiencing them. Methods have been described for predicting that an episode of AF may be imminent but specific proposed uses for such knowledge have been limited to those involving implanted atrial pacemakers G B MOODY A L Goldberger S McClennen S P Swiryn. Predicting the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001. Computers in Cardiology 28 2001 113 116 . Accordingly the present invention discloses noninvasive methods to avert AF that may be suitable for use with the general population of AF patients namely noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation along with disclosed nerve stimulation parameters that might be used for that purpose. Original onset of AF forecasting methods are also disclosed which are based upon the automatic analysis of physiological and or environmental signals that are provided preferably by non invasive sensors situated on about or near the patient. Such sensors may comprise those used in conventional Holter and bedside monitoring applications for monitoring heart rate ECG respiration core temperature hydration blood pressure brain function oxygenation and skin temperature. The sensors may also be embedded in garments or placed in sports wristwatches as currently used in programs that monitor the physiological status of soldiers G. A. Shaw A. M. Siegel G. Zogbi and T.

In one aspect of the invention devices and methods are described to produce therapeutic or prophylactic effects in a patient by utilizing an energy source that transmits energy non invasively to nervous tissue. In particular the disclosed devices can transmit energy to or in close proximity to a vagus nerve in the neck of the patient in order to temporarily stimulate block and or modulate electrophysiological signals in that nerve. The methods that are disclosed here comprise stimulating a vagus nerve with particular stimulation waveform parameters preferably using the nerve stimulator devices that are also described herein.

A novel stimulator device is used to modulate electrical activity of a vagus nerve or other nerves or tissue. The stimulator comprises a source of electrical power and two or more remote electrodes that are configured to stimulate a deep nerve relative to the nerve axis. The device also comprises continuous electrically conducting media with which the electrodes are in contact. The conducting medium is also in contact with an interface element that makes physical contact with the patient s skin. The interface element may be electrically insulating dielectric material such as a sheet of Mylar in which case electrical coupling of the device to the patient is capacitive. In other embodiments the interface element is electrically conducting material such as an electrically conducting or permeable membrane in which case electrical coupling of the device to the patient is ohmic. The interface element may have a shape that conforms to the contour of a target body surface of a patient when the medium is applied to the target body surface. In another aspect of the invention a non invasive magnetic stimulator device is used to modulate electrical activity of a vagus nerve or other nerves or tissue without actually introducing a magnetic field into the patient.

For the present medical applications the electrode based device or a magnetic stimulation device is ordinarily applied to the vicinity of the patient s neck. In one embodiment of the electrode based invention the stimulator comprises two electrodes that lie side by side within separate stimulator heads wherein the electrodes are separated by electrically insulating material. Each electrode is in continuous contact with an electrically conducting medium that extends from the interface element of the stimulator to the electrode. The interface element also contacts the patient s skin when the device is in operation. The conducting media for different electrodes are also separated by electrically insulating material.

In another embodiment of the invention a non invasive magnetic stimulator device is ordinarily applied to the vicinity of the patient s neck. In a preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulator the stimulator comprises two toroidal windings that lie side by side within separate stimulator heads wherein the toroidal windings are separated by electrically insulating material. Each toroid is in continuous contact with an electrically conducting medium that extends from the patient s skin to the toroid.

A source of power supplies a pulse of electric charge to the electrodes or magnetic stimulator coil such that the electrodes or magnetic stimulator produce an electric current and or an electric field within the patient. The electrical or magnetic stimulator is configured to induce a peak pulse voltage sufficient to produce an electric field in the vicinity of a nerve such as a vagus nerve to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation. By way of example the threshold electric field for stimulation of the nerve may be about 8 V m at 1000 Hz. For example the device may produce an electric field within the patient of about 10 to 600 V m and an electrical field gradient of greater than 2 V m mm.

Current passing through an electrode may be about 0.01 to 40 mA with voltage across the electrodes of 0.01 to 30 volts. The current is passed through the electrodes in bursts of pulses. There may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of 20 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps preferably at 15 50 bps. The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave. The preferred stimulator shapes an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve such as a vagus nerve in a patient s neck. By selecting a suitable waveform to stimulate the nerve along with suitable parameters such as current voltage pulse width pulses per burst inter burst interval etc. the stimulator produces a correspondingly selective physiological response in an individual patient. Such a suitable waveform and parameters are simultaneously selected to avoid substantially stimulating nerves and tissue other than the target nerve particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain. The suitable waveform and parameters are also selected so that when the target nerve is stimulated only desired therapeutic or prophylactic effects are preferentially produced.

The currents passing through the coils of the magnetic stimulator will saturate its core e.g. 0.1 to 2 Tesla magnetic field strength for Supermendur core material . This will require approximately 0.5 to 20 amperes of current being passed through each coil typically 2 amperes with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses as described above shaping an elongated electrical field of effect as with the electrode based stimulator.

The stimulation is performed with a sinusoidal burst waveform as described above followed by silent inter burst period which repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period may be 200 microseconds the number of pulses per burst may be N 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period of T 40000 microseconds which is comparable to 25 Hz stimulation.

More generally there may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of 20 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps preferably at 5 to 50 bps more preferably 10 to 25 bps stimulation comparable to 10 25 Hz and even more preferably at 20 bps. Although the preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave triangular or other shapes known in the art may be used as well. The stimulation is performed typically for 30 minutes. Treatment may be performed on the right or both or left vagus nerves and it may be performed alternately on the left and right vagus nerves.

Teachings of the present invention demonstrate how to treat a patient by positioning the disclosed noninvasive stimulator devices against body surfaces particularly at a location in the vicinity of the patient s neck where a vagus nerve is located under the skin. In particular the disclosure teaches methods for treating atrial fibrillation with the disclosed stimulators.

The disclosure also teaches methods for the forecasting of an imminent episode of atrial fibrillation and using the disclosed stimulators to avert the fibrillation. Models for making the forecast of imminent AF may be grey box models that incorporate knowledge of the heart s anatomy and mechanisms. They may also be black box models particularly models that make use of support vector machines. Data for making the forecasts are from physiological and or environmental signals from sensors located on or about the patient. In particular data extracted from an electrocardiogram is used to make the forecasts.

Treating or averting of an episode of atrial fibrillation is implemented within the context of control theory. A controller comprising for example the disclosed vagus nerve stimulator a PID and a feedforward model provides input to the nerves of the heart via stimulation of one or both of the patient s vagus nerves. For a patient in AF output from the patient s heart is monitored using sensors such output comprising indices characterizing one or more peaks within the spectrum of the patient s atrial electrocardiogram. The output may be used to produce feedback by the controller which uses the output to set parameters of the vagus nerve stimulation preferably in such a way as to capture peaks within the spectrum of the atrial electrocardiogram and to then reduce the characteristic frequencies of the peaks until the AF is no longer able to sustain itself.

For patients who are in normal sinus rhythm but who are at risk for the onset of an episode of atrial fibrillation the controller also tracks output from the patient s heart the output comprising heart rate variability indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone indices of P wave morphology duration and dispersion and the frequency of atrial premature beats. In closed loop mode the controller continuously selects parameters for the vagus nerve stimulation in such a way as to maintain fluctuations of the indices in the vicinity of their normal values. Otherwise the controller may be used to forecast imminence of the onset of AF using continuously acquired values of the indices to make the forecast. Upon warning by the controller of the imminent onset of AF the patient or a caregiver then applies the vagus nerve stimulator using stimulation parameters that previously had been selected when the controller was tuned for use in closed loop mode.

However it should be understood that application of the methods and devices is not limited to the examples that are given. The novel systems devices and methods for treating conditions using the disclosed stimulator or other non invasive stimulation devices are more completely described in the following detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings provided herewith and in claims appended hereto. Other aspects features advantages etc. will become apparent to one skilled in the art when the description of the invention herein is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Hereby all issued patents published patent applications and non patent publications that are mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual issued patent published patent application or non patent publication were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

In the present invention energy is transmitted non invasively to a patient using novel electrode based and or magnetic stimulation devices that are designed to meet a long felt but unsolved need to stimulate nerves electrically totally non invasively selectively and essentially without producing pain. The invention is also designed to produce electrical impulses that interact with the signals of one or more target nerves to achieve a therapeutic result. In particular the devices and methods are intended to stimulate a vagus nerve non invasively at a location in a patient s neck in order to treat atrial fibrillation or to detect and avert the onset of an imminent episode of atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation AF is a cardiac rhythm disturbance in which the duration of successive heartbeats ventricular contractions of the heart is apparently random or irregularly irregular . In most cases low amplitude oscillations f waves due to fibrillatory quivering of the heart s atria also appear on the patient s electrocardiogram. In contrast to a normal heart rhythm normal sinus rhythm which exhibits variability of heartbeat duration that is associated with autonomic and humoral influences due to exercise respiration changes in posture and the like the duration of a heartbeat in AF is typically independent of the durations of previous and successive heartbeats for many patients HORAN L G Kistler J C. Study of ventricular response in atrial fibrillation. Circ Res 9 1961 305 11 John M RAWLES and Edward Rowland. Is the pulse in atrial fibrillation irregularly irregular Br Heart J 56 4 11 U Rajendra ACHARYA Paul Joseph K Kannathal N Lim C M Suri J S. Heart rate variability a review. Med Biol Eng Comput 44 12 2006 1031 51 .

Heartbeat intervals in AF often have a statistical distribution e.g. approximately gaussian with a mean that is significantly smaller than the heartbeat duration that is experienced when the patient has a normal sinus rhythm. Thus during AF a tachycardic heartrate of 100 to 160 beats per minute is common. If the AF patient has an even higher heart rate the randomness of the inter beat interval may be difficult to discern in which case the AF could be confused with another form of supraventricular tachycardia.

Some AF patients may exhibit heart rhythms that alternate spontaneously between AF and normal sinus rhythm in which case the AF is known as paroxysmal AF. For such patients the episodes of AF may persist for seconds to a few days. Paroxysmal AF is sometimes subclassified as vagotonic versus adrenergic if the paroxysms of AF consistently occur respectively when the patient is at rest or asleep versus after strenuous exercise. However most patients with paroxysmal AF have no consistent pattern of onset. If the AF persists for seven or more days it is known as persistent AF. In patients with predominantly persistent AF interventions may be performed in an attempt to terminate the AF as described below. For patients with year long persistent AF in whom the interventions have been unsuccessful or foregone the AF may be termed permanent or longstanding respectively.

AF is a progressive disorder. In its early stage many episodes of AF may be asymptomatic and rapidly self terminating. Over decades however the episodes become longer and more frequent and without treatment the AF may eventually become permanent. The progression is partly caused by AF itself because AF produces electrophysiological biochemical and structural changes to the heart remodeling that promote longer and more frequent episodes of AF. Examples of changes that may occur during remodeling are reduction of transient outward K current and L type Ca current in myocytes calcium handling abnormalities superoxide production fibrosis over the long term and increased innervation of the atrial sympathetic nervous system.

In fewer than 10 of cases AF is observed in the absence of underlying structural or physiological abnormalities termed lone AF for patients under 60 years of age . Patients who experience the arrhythmia known as atrial flutter very often experience AF and vice versa which is understandable considering that the underlying pathophysiologies of these two arrhythmias are related. Thus the f waves seen in the electrocardiogram of a patient with atrial flutter are constant in rate and morphology whereas the f waves for an AF patient are variable in shape rate and amplitude Albert L.

The progression of AF may reflect changes in the structure of the heart and cardiovascular system that accompany other diseases. Thus hypertension vascular disease heart failure valvular heart disease especially mitral valve disease diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease are all risk factors for the development of AF. More subtle structural changes that accompany aging such as atrial dilation myocyte hypertrophy loss of sarcomeres accumulation of glycogen mitochondrial abnormalities and interstitial fibrosis may also be unobserved risk factors. Consequently advancing age is also a significant risk factor for AF. A simple scoring test is available to predict the likelihood that an individual will develop AF based upon the existence of such predisposing factors SCHNABEL R B Sullivan L M Levy D Pencina M J Massaro J M D Agostino R B Sr Newton Cheh C Yamamoto J F Magnani J W Tadros T M Kannel W B Wang T J Ellinor P T Wolf P A Vasan R S Benjamin E J.

Although AF is not an immediately life threatening arrhythmia and some 30 40 of patients with AF may not complain of any symptoms many patients with AF may experience considerable discomfort and complain of a racing heart rate palpitations or chest pain shortness of breath especially on exertion fatigue and or light headedness. The greatest risk to the AF patient is the significantly increased likelihood of a stroke due to the tendency of clots to form in their poorly contracting atria. In that regard patients with paroxysmal and permanent AF have similar risks for experiencing strokes which is a risk 3 to 5 times that of an individual without AF. It is estimated that 20 25 of all strokes are caused by AF and they are more severe than those caused by other factors. Other than strokes the most significant risk to the AF patient is that rapid heart rate caused by AF can lead to cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction which in turn can promote AF in a vicious cycle. Thus more than 40 of individuals who experience AF will also experience congestive heart failure sometime in their lives. Even after accounting for such coexisting cardiovascular conditions an individual with AF has an increased likelihood of premature death TSANG T S Miyasaka Y Barnes M E Gersh R E Epidemiological profile of atrial fibrillation a contemporary perspective.

More than 2.3 million individuals experience AF in the United States. Its prevalence increases with each decade of age so that approximately 10 of all individuals over the age of 80 have AF. For individuals greater than 40 years of age the risk of eventually experiencing AF is 1 in 6 in individuals without predisposing factors and 1 in 4 among all individuals. Males are more likely to experience AF than females. There are more hospital admissions for AF than for any other arrhythmia. The total cost for hospital admissions and office visits for AF in the United States in 2005 was 6.65 billion dollars or an average of 3600 per AF patient KANNEL W B Benjamin E J. Current perceptions of the epidemiology of atrial fibrillation. Cardiol Clin. 27 1 2009 13 24 .

The mechanism by which AF produces apparently random or irregularly irregular ventricular contractions is understood as follows. The mammalian heart has four chambers consisting of left and right atria and ventricles. The muscle surrounding all chambers of the heart contracts in a coordinated manner to pump the blood in which the atria contract before the ventricles. Earlier contraction of the atria is due to the fact that the heart muscle is electrically excitable tissue and its contraction is coupled to the passage of electrical waves that normally begin in the pacemaker region of the sino atrial SA node of the right atrium. The electrical wave that is initiated at the SA node passes across the atrium to the atrioventricular AV node in the lower right atrium which is delayed there before being conducted to the ventricles through the Bundle of His. Once the electrical wave is conducted to the ventricles they complete the cardiac cycle by contracting and then recover to make possible a subsequent contraction.

In a normal electrocardiogram ECG this sequence of electrical excitation and contraction corresponds to a series of structures in the ECG. The P wave corresponds to an electrical wave passing from the SA node across the right atrium to the AV node and to the left atrium. This is followed by a QRS complex corresponding to depolarization of both ventricles which is then followed by a T wave corresponding to repolarization of the ventricles. In atrial fibrillation the electrical waves that are initiated by the SA node are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical waves that originate elsewhere in the atria often near the roots of the pulmonary veins. Such waves may occur at a high rate but most of them do not result in contraction of the ventricles. This is because once such a wave reaches the AV node to initiate contraction of the ventricles subsequent waves reaching the AV node cannot initiate a ventricular contraction until conduction of the earlier wave through the AV node is complete. Thus although patients with AF may experience a high heart rate the rate of ventricular contraction is limited by the electrical gatekeeping role of the AV node and associated fibers that conduct impulses from the atria to the ventricles. However because the successfully conducted waves reach the AV node at irregular intervals the time between heart beats e.g. time between QRS complexes associated with ventricular contraction of an AF patient appears to be random or chaotic and the atria themselves quiver fibrillate . Furthermore the electrical activity associated with the quivering results in low amplitude oscillations f waves on the AF patient s electrocardiogram and the P wave that would correspond to the coordinated electrical activity of normally contracting atria is absent.

It is generally agreed that AF is produced by localized or multiple non localized sources of electrical waves that are generally distant from the heart s normal pacemaker region NATTEL S.

NARAYAN and David E. Krummen. Dynamics Factors Preceding the Initiation of Atrial Fibrillation in Humans. Heart Rhythm 5 6 Suppl 2008 S22 S25 . The localized source may be an ectopic focal discharge or it may be a localized reentrant circuit wherein the atrial tissue propagates action potentials in such a way that the action potentials loop around so as to reactivate themselves reentry . The focal discharge may occur in myocytes that can act as automatic pacemakers but in which the automatic rate has become abnormally high in myocytes that are not ordinarily automatic pacemakers but have become so or in myocytes that are triggered to exhibit extra action potentials delayed afterdepolarizaiton early afterpolarizations . The reentry circuits may be stable mother waves of different sizes that may be determined by anatomical features circus movements around obstacles or minimal paths without obstacles leading circle movements . For leading circle movements the minimal path of reentrant movement i.e. the wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the refractory period during which a new action potential may not be initiated. Reentrant circuits may also be unstable but nevertheless able to sustain AF if they continuously reform provided that at least one such circuit always exists. Reentry may also be due to fixed or wandering rotors which are spiral or scroll shaped micro reentrant vortices that rotate rapidly around an excitable but unexcited core.

AF due to multiple nonlocalized sources may be due to multiple wavelets that propagate randomly or chaotically throughout the atrium such that some wavelets may be propagating while others remain fully or partially refractory as the result of a preceding activation. According to this mechanism AF is a turbulent and self sustaining process that is made possible by inhomogeneous atrial repolarization acting independently of its initiating mechanism. High resolution electrode mapping indicates that for this mechanism to sustain AF there must be at least four to six wavelets simultaneously propagating randomly across the atrium. The smaller the wavelength is due to conduction slowing refractory period shortening or both then the greater the possible number of wavelets and consequently the more easily AF is induced and maintained.

The existence of AF is easily diagnosed from an electrocardiogram for example from the irregularity of the time interval between heart beats the absence of a P wave and or the presence of baseline fibrillatory activity f waves . Computer based automatic AF detection algorithms also search an electrocardiogram for such features DASH S Chon K H Lu S Raeder E A. Automatic real time detection of atrial fibrillation. Ann Biomed Eng 37 9 2009 1701 9 . However the state of the noninvasive clinical diagnostic art is such that detailed characterization of a patient s AF in terms of particular ectopic foci or reentrant movements is not currently possible. The present invention advances the noninvasive diagnostic art by disclosing methods that may be used to obtain such a detailed characterization in connection with methods for forecasting the time course of a patient s AF as described below. Otherwise methods have been developed to partially quantify a patient s AF. The simplest method is to measure the size in millivolts of the f waves in leads Vand lead II of an electrocardiogram the values of which correlate with the ability to terminate AF I NAULT et al. Clinical value of fibrillatory wave amplitude on surface ECG in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. J Interv Card Electrophysiol 26 1 2009 11 9 .

A more powerful group of methods has as its goal the extraction from a surface electrocardiogram that portion of the electrocardiogram that is due to atrial electrical activity separated from the much larger ventricular electrical activity. This may be accomplished for example by identifying different types of QRST complexes averaging those complexes over multiple beats then subtracting the corresponding averaged QRST complex from the electrocardiogram so as to extract an atrial electrocardiogram. Alternatively methods involving principal component analysis may be used to extract the atrial waveform without explicitly subtracting a ventricular waveform or extraction may be performed during the T Q interval when no ventricular waveform need be subtracted BOLLMANN A Husser D Mainardi L Lombardi F Langley P Murray A Rieta J J Millet J Olsson S B Stridh M S rnmo L.

Once an extracted atrial electrocardiogram is available possibly corresponding preferentially to one or more selected regions of the atria the cardiogram may then be analyzed in order to partially characterize the patient s AF. For example construction of the Fourier transform of the atrial electrocardiogram reveals that many patients have single narrow banded fibrillatory frequency spectra with a fibrillatory rate that varies greatly between individuals typically in the range 4 to 9 Hz . Transforms other than the Fourier transform may also be used CIACCIO E J Biviano A B Whang W Coromilas J Garan H. A new transform for the analysis of complex fractionated atrial electrograms. Biomed Eng Online 10 2011 35 . Patients with persistent AF generally exhibit a peak in their atrial electrocardiogram spectrum at a higher frequency than patients with paroxysmal AF so that the peak frequency observed in a patient on successive days might serve as an indicator of progressive atrial remodeling or response to a therapy. The width of the frequency spectrum band may be used as an indicator of the dispersion of fibrillation rates either from the presence of multiple wavelets or from spatiotemporal organization of waves propagating from an ectopic focus to the rest of the atria. In patients who have been treated with anti arrhythmic drugs both the peak frequency and the width of the frequency spectrum band have been observed to decrease HUSSER D Stridh M Sornmo L Platonov P Olsson S B Bollmann A.

The frequency spectrum of the extracted atrial electrocardiogram is generally not stationary so that it may be useful to plot a spectrogram and or compare the spectrum over a succession of short time intervals time frequency analysis . Thus over some time periods the spectrum may briefly exhibit multiple peaks or the dominant peak may briefly increase its modal frequency. The maximum peak frequency that is observed among the spectra at different times is thought to correlate closely with atrial refractoriness BOLLMANN A Husser D Stridh M Soernmo L Majic M Klein H U Olsson S B.

The electrical activity of the atria may exhibit regional differences that may attributable in part to the location of the reentrant loops and or ectopic foci that give rise to AF. By selecting particular electrocardiographic leads for analysis it is possible to preferentially extract electrophysiological characteristics of the corresponding portions of the atria. Thus ECG leads I Vand aVL preferentially characterize left atrial activity leads II III and aVpreferentially characterize activity of the inferior atrial surface or coronary sinus and leads V V and aVR preferentially characterize right atrial activity RAVI K C Krummen D E Tran A J Bullinga J R Narayan S M.

Methods of treating AF have developed continuously for many years KHASNIS A Thakur R K. Atrial fibrillation a historical perspective. Med Clin North Am 92 1 2008 1 15 .

Autonomic trigger patterns and anti arrhythmic treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation data from the Euro Heart Survey. Eur Heart J 29 5 2008 632 9 . Temporary causes include excessive alcohol consumption and recent surgery or infections. The most common correctable cause of AF is hyperthyroidism. Other potential causes of AF such as hypertension would be treated but such treatment may not necessarily bring about a conversion to normal sinus rhythm. However most cases of AF cannot be attributed to a particular set of causes and are treated accordingly. Currently major goals in the treatment of AF are the prevention of stroke and the relief of symptoms such as rapid heart rate. This is preferably accomplished by terminating the AF or treating the symptoms if conversion to normal sinus rhythm is not successful V FUSTER et al. ACC AHA ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation executive summary.

If the AF patient is seen in the emergency room it is most likely because of a high heart rate which may be treated with intravenous diltiazem or esmolol. If the patient is experiencing a first episode of AF or if the patient previously had normal sinus rhythm for an extended period of time it is then appropriate to consider promptly attempting to convert the AF to normal sinus rhythm cardioversion . In part this is because AF induced remodeling of the heart may make cardioversion at a later time more difficult. However if there is reason to believe that the AF would self terminate or if the AF may have a temporary or correctable cause it is appropriate to defer an attempted cardioversion.

Methods are available to predict the spontaneous termination of atrial fibrillation using surface electrocardiograms so that unnecessary treatment of self terminating AF may be avoided. Such prediction has even been the subject of a competition G B MOODY. Spontaneous Termination of Atrial Fibrillation A Challenge from PhysioNet and Computers in Cardiology 2004.

If a decision is made to attempt to convert AF into a normal sinus rhythm pharmacological and electrical methods have been developed to do so KIM S S Knight B P. Electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. Med Clin North Am 92 1 2008 101 20 . Pharmacological cardioversion is unlikely to succeed if an AF episode has lasted more than 7 days. For episodes that have lasted only a few days the AF might be terminated by intravenous administration of ibutilide procainamide or amiodarone. For patients without structural heart disease the AF might also be terminated by oral administration of propafenone or flecainide. If the patient has no adverse reaction to the oral drug the patient may then be a candidate for episodic self administration of the drug on an outpatient basis.

If pharmacological cardioversion does not succeed or if the patient s AF has persisted more than 7 days the AF might be terminated by applying one or more transthoracic electrical shocks possibly in combination with infused ibutilide. The shocks are painful so the patient needs to be sedated with a drug such as diazepam. However for approximately 25 of the patients the electrical cardioversion is either totally unsuccessful or the AF returns within seconds to hours of normal sinus rhythm having been restored. Furthermore cardioversion carries risks to the patient. Regardless of whether the cardioversion is performed pharmacologically or electrically anticoagulation medications should ordinarily be taken for three weeks before the cardioversion in order to prevent thromboembolic complications A. J. CAMM et al. Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation the Task Force for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology ESC . European Heart Journal 31 2010 2369 2439 .

An implanted atrial defibrillator may also be used to electrically cardiovert a patient who is experiencing AF. The energy required to do so is considerably less than the energy needed for transthoracic electric cardioversion. However the internal shocks are quite painful and because such internal shocks can precipitate ventricular fibrillation atrial defibrillators are currently only built into conventional implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICDs for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and or tachycardia.

Additional methods for terminating the AF are also available Ole Gunnar ANFINSEN. Non pharmacological Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation. Indian Pacing Electrophysiol J 2 1 2002 4 14 . One method is radiofrequency catheter ablation of the atrioventricular node followed by implantation of a pacemaker. Electrical pacing may also be useful for the prevention or termination of AF especially in patients with bradycardia B P KNIGHT et al. Role of permanent pacing to prevent atrial fibrillation. Circulation 111 2 2005 240 3 . Another method is radiofrequency catheter ablation of localized sources ectopic foci or localized reentrant circuits that may be responsible for the AF. Such ablation strategies include circumferential pulmonary vein isolation pulmonary vein isolation followed by extensive ablation at many sites within the atria and electrogram guided ablation in which potential sources of AF are identified by electrode mapping before ablation ATIENZA F Almendral J Jalife J Zlochiver S Ploutz Snyder R Torrecilla E G Arenal A Kalifa J Fernandez Aviles F Berenfeld O. Real time dominant frequency mapping and ablation of dominant frequency sites in atrial fibrillation with left to right frequency gradients predicts long term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Heart Rhythm 6 1 2009 33 40 . Treatment by localized ablation is not possible if the sources are not themselves localized but AF resulting from multiple nonlocalized sources might be treated by the placement of multiple surgical lesions in the atrium to compartmentalize the atria into regions that cannot support the propagation of multiple wavelets GILLINOV A M Saltman A E. Surgical approaches for atrial fibrillation. Med Clin North Am 92 1 2008 203 15 . Surgical ablation methods are ordinarily not performed as stand alone operations but are instead performed in conjunction with surgery for coronary artery bypass or valve repair replacement. A related surgical procedure is the excision or closure of the left atrial appendage in order to prevent arterial thrombi from forming.

Because of the risks and expense associated with such catheter or surgical ablation methods they are usually not attempted unless attempts are first made to control the patient s high heart rate without necessarily converting the AF to normal sinus rhythm. The potential benefit of maintaining sinus rhythm with anti arrhythmic drugs is negated by potential adverse effects of those drugs including increased mortality. Therefore a strategy that attempts only to control the high heart rate of AF patients may be preferable to a rhythm control strategy or a combined rhythm rate control strategy especially in asymptomatic patients or in patients for whom previous cardioversion only temporarily terminated the AF.

Partial denervation of the vagus or other autonomic nerves has sometimes been used to treat AF which is ordinarily done only in conjunction with ablation to circumferentially isolate the pulmonary vein CHOU C C Chen P S. New concepts in atrial fibrillation neural mechanisms and calcium dynamics. Cardiol Clin 27 1 2009 35 43 . TAN and colleagues suggest that ablation of extracardiac autonomic nerves may be an effective alternative to ablation of intracardiac autonomic nerves for the treatment of AF. They found that decentralization rather than denervation is the anti arrhythmic mechanism of stellate ganglion and vagus nerve denervation TAN A Y Zhou S Ogawa M Song J Chu M Li H Fishbein M C Lin S F Chen L S Chen P S. Neural mechanisms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia in ambulatory canines. Circulation 118 9 2008 916 25 .

Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has also been proposed as another treatment for atrial fibrillation which would have an advantage over vagus denervation in that effects of stimulation would generally not be irreversible. However vagus nerve stimulation has been attempted only invasively in animal experiments. At one time electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve especially the right vagus nerve was considered to invariably exacerbate rather than ameliorate the dangers of AF. In fact electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve has long been used to induce and maintain AF. For example bilateral vagus nerve stimulation at 20 Hz at a level sufficient to induce a 50 decrease in sinus heart rate increases inducibility of AF an effect that is blocked by ablation of ganglionated plexi of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system LU Z Cui B He B Hu X Wu W Huang C Jiang H.

Nevertheless it is now thought that vagal nerve stimulation VNS might also be protective against AF provided that parameters of the nerve stimulation are properly selected ZHANG Y Mazgalev T N. Arrhythmias and vagus nerve stimulation. Heart Fail Rev 16 2 2011 147 61 . Although treatment of AF with VNS has not been attempted in humans there is reason to believe that it is feasible. For example VNS has been used to treat epilepsy and depression in many patients without producing AF except for one case of transient AF that may have been due to temporary injury to the vagus nerve during surgical implantation SRINIVASAN B Awasthi A. Transient atrial fibrillation after the implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator. Epilepsia 45 12 2004 1645 SPUCK S Tronnier V Orosz I Schonweiler R Sepehrnia A Nowak G Sperner J. Operative and technical complications of vagus nerve stimulator implantation. Neurosurgery 67 2 Suppl Operative 2010 489 94 .

It may well be that the stimulation parameters that are typically used in therapeutic VNS for conditions such as epilepsy are not suitable for the induction of AF and or that because VNS is ordinarily performed on the left vagus nerve induction of AF is not likely. Invasive vagal nerve stimulation typically uses square wave pulse signals. The typical waveform parameter values for VNS therapy for epilepsy and depression are a current between 1 and 2 mA a frequency of between 20 and 30 Hz a pulse width of 250 500 microseconds and a duty cycle of 10 signal ON time of 30 s and a signal OFF time to 5 min . Output current is gradually increased from 0.25 mA to the maximum tolerable level maximum 3.5 mA with typical therapeutic settings ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 mA. Greater output current is associated with increased side effects including voice alteration cough a feeling of throat tightening and dyspnea. Frequency is typically 20 Hz in depression and 30 Hz in epilepsy. The therapy is adjusted in a gradual systematic fashion to individualize therapy for each patient. To treat migraine headaches typical VNS parameters are a current of 0.25 to 1 mA a frequency of 30 Hz a pulse width of 500 microseconds and an ON time of 30 s every 5 min. To treat migraine plus epilepsy typical parameters are 1.75 mA a frequency of 20 Hz a pulse width of 250 microseconds and ON time of 7 s followed by an OFF time of 12 s. To treat mild to moderate Alzheimer s disease typical VNS waveform parameters are a current of 0.25 to 0.5 mA a frequency of 20 Hz a pulse width of 500 microseconds and an ON time of 30 s every 5 min ANDREWS A.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 33 2009 1042 1060 . However if a patient in whom a vagus nerve stimulator had already been implanted did develop AF and if the AF terminated after the stimulation parameters were changed it would not be clear whether the termination was due to the absence of previous parameters that promoted AF or to the presence of new parameters that inhibit AF.

Information suggesting the potentially protective effect of vagal nerve stimulation on AF has come from animal experiments involving invasive stimulation as described below most of which used dog models. In that regard it should be noted that the vagus nerves of dogs have a different anatomy than that of humans. Depending on species sympathetic fibers may run an early course together with vagal fibers as in the cat and dog i.e. the vagosympathetic trunk or be separate as in rabbit and humans. The vagosympathetic trunk runs along the dorsal border of the common carotid artery and is formed by the convergence caudal to the cranial cervical ganglion of the vagus and sympathetic nerves. These nerve cords lose their association only before reaching the thoracic inlet where they separate. Therefore unless the vagus nerve is surgically isolated within the vagosympathetic trunk of the dog is conceivable that results obtained by stimulating the vagosympathetic trunk of the dog may be attributable in part to co stimulation of sympathetic nerves. Nevertheless the following publications suggest that low level stimulation of the vagus nerve may be protective against AF.

ZHANG et al. reported that the arrhythmogenic effect of VNS is intensity dependent and requires a threshold to be manifest. Using 20 Hz pulse width 0.2 ms square pulses they found that moderate VNS producing less than a 40 reduction of sinus cycle length has no effect on AF inducibility ZHANG Y Ilsar I Sabbah H N Ben David T Mazgalev T N.

LI et al. performed VNS by applying 20 Hz 0.1 ms duration square wave pulses for 3 hours to both vagosympathetic trunks in dogs. One volt lower than the threshold of VNS required to lower the sinus rate was defined to be low level VNS. At this low level VNS caused an increase in the threshold of high frequency stimulation needed to induce AF which was said to be not dependent on the activation of afferent vagal nerve fibers that project to the brain. They interpret their findings as indicating complex interactions between the extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system LI S Scherlag B J Yu L Sheng X Zhang Y Ali R Dong Y Ghias M Po S S.

SHA et al. performed similar stimulation experiments with 20 Hz 0.1 ms duration square wave pulses except that only the right vagus nerve was stimulated and low level VNS was defined to be 50 of voltage needed to lower the sinus rate. Their results were similar to the above mentioned results of LI et al. In addition sinus rate slowing or acceleration that could be induced by stimulation of the superior left ganglionated plexi and right stellate ganglion respectively were inhibited by the vagal stimulation. They interpret the results as indicating that VNS suppresses both sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system SHA Y Scherlag B J Yu L Sheng X Jackman W M Lazzara R Po S S.

SHENG et al applied low level 20 Hz 0.1 ms duration square wave pulses to both vagosympathetic trunks in dogs and found that the stimulation can prevent or reverse remodeling of the heart that is due to experimentally induced AF.

Applicant is not aware of any patent or patent application that disclosed or suggested the use of noninvasive nerve stimulation for the treatment or prevention of atrial fibrillation or its sequelae. The only related patents or applications are those dealing with the use of an implanted electrode or other invasive technique for example the following patents. U.S. Pat.

Applicant is also unaware of any patent or patent application that disclosed or suggested the use of noninvasive nerve stimulation for the prevention of atrial fibrillation. The only relevant patents or applications are those related to the use of an implanted electrode or other invasive technique for example the following. U.S. Pat. No. 5 522 854 entitled Method and apparatus for the prevention of arrhythmia by nerve stimulation to prevent arrhythmia to IDEKER et al. discloses an implantable apparatus wherein risk of ventricular tachycardia is based on the ratio of sympathetic nerve activity to parasympathetic nerve activity and nerves including a vagus nerve may be stimulated. Patent application number US20070179543 entitled Techniques for prevention of atrial fibrillation to BEN DAVID et al and U.S. Pat. No. 8 005 545 Parasympathetic stimulation for prevention and treatment of atrial fibrillation to BEN DAVID et al disclose methods of reducing a risk of an occurrence of an episode of the atrial fibrillation by applying an electrical current to a site of the subject containing parasympathetic nervous tissue such as a vagus nerve an epicardial fat pad a sinoatrial SA node fat pad an atrioventricular AV node fat pad etc. The methods involve the invasive application of at least one electrode device to such a site of the subject.

The nerve may be a vagus nerve which may also be stimulated by the device. The patent makes no mention of atrial fibrillation.

Applicant is also unaware of any patent or patent application that disclosed or suggested the use of noninvasive nerve stimulation for preventing atrial fibrillation sequelae such as strokes caused by emboli. The only relevant patents or applications are those related to the use of an implanted electrode or other invasive technique for example the following. U.S. Pat. No. 7 885 711 entitled Vagal stimulation for anti embolic therapy to BEN EZRA discloses applying an electrical current to a vagus nerve of a subject suffering from spontaneous atrial fibrillation comprising an electrode device adapted to be coupled to a nerve of a subject. U.S. Pat.

Patent application US20080091245 entitled Combined parasympathetic stimulation and cardiac pacing to BEN EZRA et al discloses an electrode device coupled to tissue selected from the group consisting of a vagus nerve an epicardial fat pad and atrial tissue etc. of a subject suffering from spontaneous atrial fibrillation. The device is configured to maintain spontaneous AF for at least about 24 hours so as to modify blood flow within the atria and reduce risk of thromboembolic events.

The present invention addresses a significant impediment to the development of the above mentioned animal experiment observations into useful AF treatment for humans. That impediment is the unavailability of a non invasive nerve stimulator that produces little or no pain and that does not generate unwanted side effects but nevertheless can stimulate the vagus nerve to achieve therapeutic results. The availability of such a noninvasive stimulator will increase the number and types of individuals with whom vagal nerve stimulation might be undertaken as a potential treatment for AF as described in the introductory section of this application. The paragraphs that follow disclose such noninvasive stimulation devices. After the devices are described their use to treat and or avert atrial fibrillation will be disclosed.

Transcutaneous electrical stimulation with electrodes as well as with magnetic stimulators can be unpleasant or painful in the experience of patients that undergo such procedures. The quality of sensation caused by stimulation depends strongly on current and frequency such that currents barely greater than the perception threshold generally cause painless sensations described as tingle itch vibration buzz touch pressure or pinch but higher currents can cause sharp or burning pain. As the depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin is increased any pain will generally begin or increase. Strategies to reduce the pain include use of anesthetics placed on or injected into the skin near the stimulation and placement of foam pads on the skin at the site of stimulation Jeffrey J.

Other methods of reducing pain are intended to be used with invasive nerve stimulation U.S. Pat. No. 7 904 176 entitled Techniques for reducing pain associated with nerve stimulation to BEN EZRA et al .

Additional considerations related to pain resulting from the stimulation are as follows. When stimulation is repeated over the course of multiple sessions patients may adapt to the pain and exhibit progressively less discomfort. Patients may be heterogeneous with respect to their threshold for pain caused by stimulation including heterogeneity related to gender and age. Electrical properties of an individual s skin vary from day to day and may be affected by cleaning abrasion and the application of various electrode gels and pastes. Skin properties may also be affected by the stimulation itself as a function of the duration of stimulation the recovery time between stimulation sessions the transdermal voltage the current density and the power density. The application of multiple electrical pulses can result in different perception or pain thresholds and levels of sensation depending on the spacing and rate at which pulses are applied. The separation distance between two electrodes determines whether sensations from the electrodes are separate overlap or merge. The limit for tolerable sensation is sometimes said to correspond to a current density of 0.5 mA cm but in reality the functional relationship between pain and current density is very complicated. Maximum local current density may be more important in producing pain than average current density and local current density generally varies under an electrode e.g. with greater current densities along edges of the electrode or at hot spots. Furthermore pain thresholds can have a thermal and or electrochemical component as well as a current density component. Pulse frequency plays a significant role in the perception of pain with muscle contraction being involved at some frequencies and not others and with the spatial extent of the pain sensation also being a function of frequency. The sensation is also a function of the waveform square wave sinusoidal trapezoidal etc. especially if pulses are less than a millisecond in duration Mark R. PRAUSNITZ.

Considering that there are so many variables that may influence the likelihood of pain during non invasive electrical stimulation detailed stimulus waveform frequency current density electrode type and geometry skin preparation etc. considering that these same variables must be simultaneously selected in order to independently produce a desired therapeutic outcome by nerve stimulation and considering that one also wishes to selectively stimulate the nerve e.g. avoid stimulating a nearby nerve it is understandable that prior to the present disclosure no one has described devices and methods for stimulating a nerve electrically totally non invasively selectively and without causing substantial pain.

Applicant discovered the disclosed electrode based devices and methods in the course of experimentation with a magnetic stimulation device that was disclosed in Applicant s commonly assigned co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 964 050 entitled Magnetic Stimulation Devices and Methods of Therapy to SIMON et al. Thus combined elements in the electrode based invention do not merely perform the function that the elements perform separately viz. perform therapeutic electrical stimulation or neuromodulation minimize stimulation pain or stimulate the nerve selectively and one of ordinary skill in the art would not have combined the claimed elements by known methods because the archetypal magnetic stimulator was known only to Applicant. That stimulator used a magnetic coil embedded in a safe and practical conducting medium that was in direct contact with arbitrarily oriented skin of a patient which had not been described in its closest art Rafael CARBUNARU and Dominique M. Durand. Toroidal coil models for transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of nerves. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 48 4 2001 434 441 Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN Coil Designs for Localized and Efficient Magnetic Stimulation of the Nervous System. Ph.D. Dissertation Department of Biomedical Engineering Case Western Reserve May 1999. UMI Microform Number 9940153 UMI Company Ann Arbor Mich. . Existing magnetic stimulators are complex and expensive use high currents that overheat and limit the possible duration of stimulation and can produce stimulation pain. In contrast to existing magnetic stimulators the stimulator that was disclosed in Applicant s above cited co pending patent application is relatively simple to construct and operates with low currents. Furthermore the device confines the magnetic field to within the device itself so that magnetic fields do not enter the patient s body. As a result this design makes it possible to stimulate the patient s nerve over an extended period of time selectively and without producing pain.

Although the magnetic stimulator coil is shown in to be a single coil in practice the coil may also comprise two or more distinct coils each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the coil that is shown in represents all the magnetic stimulator coils of the device collectively. In a preferred embodiment that is discussed in connection with below coil actually contains two coils that may be connected either in series or in parallel to the impulse generator .

The item labeled in as is a volume surrounding the coil that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As shown the medium not only encloses the magnetic stimulator coil but is also deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the electrically conducting medium corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the conducting medium is applied so as to make the medium and body surface contiguous. As time varying electrical current is passed through the coil a magnetic field is produced but because the coil winding is toroidal the magnetic field is spatially restricted to the interior of the toroid. An electric field and eddy currents are also produced. The electric field extends beyond the toroidal space and into the patient s body causing electrical currents and stimulation within the patient. The volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to significantly reduce the current passed through the coil that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. In a preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulator that is discussed below in connection with the conducting medium with which the coil is in contact need not completely surround the toroid.

The design of the magnetic stimulator which is adapted herein for use with surface electrodes makes it possible to shape the electric field that is used to selectively stimulate a relatively deep nerve such as a vagus nerve in the patient s neck. Furthermore the design produces significantly less pain or discomfort if any to a patient than stimulator devices that are currently known in the art. Conversely for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient e.g. the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins the design achieves a greater depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin.

Although a pair of electrodes is shown in in practice the electrodes may also comprise three or more distinct electrode elements each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the electrodes that are shown in represent all electrodes of the device collectively.

The item labeled in as is a volume contiguous with an electrode that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As described below in connection with embodiments of the invention conducting medium in which the electrode is embedded need not completely surround an electrode. As also described below in connection with a preferred embodiment the volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to shape the current density passed through an electrode that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. The electrical connection to the patient s skin surface is through an interface . In one embodiment the interface is made of an electrically insulating dielectric material such as a thin sheet of Mylar. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is capacitive. In other embodiments the interface comprises electrically conducting material such as the electrically conducting medium itself or an electrically conducting or permeable membrane. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is ohmic. As shown the interface may be deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the interface corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the interface is applied so as to make the interface and body surface contiguous.

The control unit controls the impulse generator to generate a signal for each of the device s coils or electrodes. The signals are selected to be suitable for amelioration of a particular medical condition when the signals are applied non invasively to a target nerve or tissue via the coil or electrodes . It is noted that nerve stimulating modulating device or may be referred to by its function as a pulse generator. Patent application publications US20050075701 and US20050075702 both to SHAFER both of which are incorporated herein by reference relating to stimulation of neurons of the sympathetic nervous system to attenuate an immune response contain descriptions of pulse generators that may be applicable to the present invention. By way of example a pulse generator is also commercially available such as Agilent 33522A Function Arbitrary Waveform Generator Agilent Technologies Inc. 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd Santa Clara Calif. 95051.

The control unit may also comprise a general purpose computer comprising one or more CPU computer memories for the storage of executable computer programs including the system s operating system and the storage and retrieval of data disk storage devices communication devices such as serial and USB ports for accepting external signals from the system s keyboard and computer mouse as well as any externally supplied physiological signals see analog to digital converters for digitizing externally supplied analog signals see communication devices for the transmission and receipt of data to and from external devices such as printers and modems that comprise part of the system hardware for generating the display of information on monitors that comprise part of the system and busses to interconnect the above mentioned components. Thus the user may operate the system by typing instructions for the control unit at a device such as a keyboard and view the results on a device such as the system s computer monitor or direct the results to a printer modem and or storage disk. Control of the system may be based upon feedback measured from externally supplied physiological or environmental signals. Alternatively the control unit may have a compact and simple structure for example wherein the user may operate the system using only an on off switch and power control wheel or knob.

Parameters for the nerve or tissue stimulation include power level frequency and train duration or pulse number . The stimulation characteristics of each pulse such as depth of penetration strength and selectivity depend on the rise time and peak electrical energy transferred to the electrodes or coils as well as the spatial distribution of the electric field that is produced by the electrodes or coils. The rise time and peak energy are governed by the electrical characteristics of the stimulator and electrodes or coils as well as by the anatomy of the region of current flow within the patient. In one embodiment of the invention pulse parameters are set in such as way as to account for the detailed anatomy surrounding the nerve that is being stimulated Bartosz SAWICKI Robert Szmurto Przemystaw Ptonecki Jacek Starzynski Stanislaw Wincenciak Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam 105 Press 2008 . Pulses may be monophasic biphasic or polyphasic. Embodiments of the invention include those that are fixed frequency where each pulse in a train has the same inter stimulus interval and those that have modulated frequency where the intervals between each pulse in a train can be varied.

In addition or as an alternative to the devices to implement the modulation unit for producing the electrical voltage current profile of the stimulating blocking and or modulating impulses to the electrodes or coils the device disclosed in patent publication No. US20050216062 entitled Multi functional electrical stimulation system to HERBST may be employed. That patent publication discloses a multifunctional electrical stimulation ES system adapted to yield output signals for effecting electromagnetic or other forms of electrical stimulation for a broad spectrum of different biological and biomedical applications which produce an electric field pulse in order to non invasively stimulate nerves. The system includes an ES signal stage having a selector coupled to a plurality of different signal generators each producing a signal having a distinct shape such as a sine wave a square or a saw tooth wave or simple or complex pulse the parameters of which are adjustable in regard to amplitude duration repetition rate and other variables. Examples of the signals that may be generated by such a system are described in a publication by LIBOFF A. R. LIBOFF. Signal shapes in electromagnetic therapies a primer. pp. 17 37 in Bioelectromagnetic Medicine Paul J. Rosch and Marko S. Markov eds. . New York Marcel Dekker 2004 . The signal from the selected generator in the ES stage is fed to at least one output stage where it is processed to produce a high or low voltage or current output of a desired polarity whereby the output stage is capable of yielding an electrical stimulation signal appropriate for its intended application. Also included in the system is a measuring stage which measures and displays the electrical stimulation signal operating on the substance being treated as well as the outputs of various sensors which sense conditions prevailing in this substance whereby the user of the system can manually adjust it or have it automatically adjusted by feedback to provide an electrical stimulation signal of whatever type the user wishes who can then observe the effect of this signal on a substance being treated.

The stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse signal preferably has a frequency an amplitude a duty cycle a pulse width a pulse shape etc. selected to influence the therapeutic result namely stimulating blocking and or modulating some or all of the transmission of the selected nerve. For example the frequency may be about 1 Hz or greater such as between about 15 Hz to 50 Hz more preferably around 25 Hz. The modulation signal may have a pulse width selected to influence the therapeutic result such as about 20 microseconds or greater such as about 20 microseconds to about 1000 microseconds. For example the electric field induced by the device within tissue in the vicinity of a nerve is 10 to 600 V m preferably around 300 V m. The gradient of the electric field may be greater than 2 V m mm. More generally the stimulation device produces an electric field in the vicinity of the nerve that is sufficient to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation which is approximately 8 V m at 1000 Hz.

An objective of the disclosed stimulators is to provide both nerve fiber selectivity and spatial selectivity. Spatial selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the electrode or coil configuration and nerve fiber selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the stimulus waveform but designs for the two types of selectivity are intertwined. This is because for example a waveform may selectively stimulate only one of two nerves whether they lie close to one another or not obviating the need to focus the stimulating signal onto only one of the nerves GRILL W and Mortimer J T. Stimulus waveforms for selective neural stimulation. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. 14 1995 375 385 . These methods complement others that are used to achieve selective nerve stimulation such as the use of local anesthetic application of pressure inducement of ischemia cooling use of ultrasound graded increases in stimulus intensity exploiting the absolute refractory period of axons and the application of stimulus blocks John E. SWETT and Charles M. Bourassa. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. In Electrical Stimulation Research Techniques Michael M. Patterson and Raymond P. Kesner eds. Academic Press. New York 1981 pp. 243 295 .

To date the selection of stimulation waveform parameters for nerve stimulation has been highly empirical in which the parameters are varied about some initially successful set of parameters in an effort to find an improved set of parameters for each patient. A more efficient approach to selecting stimulation parameters might be to select a stimulation waveform that mimics electrical activity in the anatomical regions that one is attempting stimulate indirectly in an effort to entrain the naturally occurring electrical waveform as suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6 234 953 entitled Electrotherapy device using low frequency magnetic pulses to THOMAS et al. and application number US20090299435 entitled Systems and methods for enhancing or affecting neural stimulation efficiency and or efficacy to GLINER et al. One may also vary stimulation parameters iteratively in search of an optimal setting U.S. Pat. No. 7 869 885 entitled Threshold optimization for tissue stimulation therapy to BEGNAUD et al . However some stimulation waveforms such as those described herein are discovered by trial and error and then deliberately improved upon.

Invasive nerve stimulation typically uses square wave pulse signals. However Applicant found that square waveforms are not ideal for non invasive stimulation as they produce excessive pain. Prepulses and similar waveform modifications have been suggested as methods to improve selectivity of nerve stimulation waveforms but Applicant did not find them ideal Aleksandra VUCKOVIC Marco Tosato and Johannes J.

Applicant also found that stimulation waveforms consisting of bursts of square pulses are not ideal for non invasive stimulation M. I. JOHNSON C. H. Ashton D. R. Bousfield and J. W. Thompson. Analgesic effects of different pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cold induced pain in normal subjects. Journal of Psychosomatic Research 35 2 3 1991 313 321 U.S. Pat. No. 7 734 340 entitled Stimulation design for neuromodulation to De Ridder U.S. Pat. No. 7 778 703 entitled Selective nerve fiber stimulation for treating heart conditions to Gross et al . However bursts of sinusoidal pulses are a preferred stimulation waveform as shown in . As seen there individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal the inter burst period . The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period may be 200 microseconds the number of pulses per burst may be N 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period of T 40000 microseconds a much smaller value of T is shown in to make the bursts discernable . When these exemplary values are used for T and the waveform contains significant Fourier components at higher frequencies 1 200 microseconds 5000 sec as compared with those contained in transcutaneous nerve stimulation waveforms as currently practiced.

Applicant is unaware of such a waveform having been used with therapeutic nerve stimulation but a similar waveform has been used to stimulate muscle as a means of increasing muscle strength in elite athletes. However for the muscle strengthening application the currents used 200 mA may be very painful and two orders of magnitude larger than what are disclosed herein. Furthermore the signal used for muscle strengthening may be other than sinusoidal e.g. triangular and the parameters N and T may also be dissimilar from the values exemplified above A. DELITTO M.

A preferred embodiment of the electrode based stimulator is shown in . A cross sectional view of the stimulator along its long axis is shown in . As shown the stimulator comprises two heads and a body that joins them. Each head contains a stimulating electrode. The body of the stimulator contains the electronic components and battery not shown that are used to generate the signals that drive the electrodes which are located behind the insulating board that is shown in . However in other embodiments of the invention the electronic components that generate the signals that are applied to the electrodes may be separate but connected to the electrode head using wires. Furthermore other embodiments of the invention may contain a single such head or more than two heads.

Heads of the stimulator are applied to a surface of the patient s body during which time the stimulator may be held in place by straps or frames not shown or the stimulator may be held against the patient s body by hand. In either case the level of stimulation power may be adjusted with a wheel that also serves as an on off switch. A light is illuminated when power is being supplied to the stimulator. An optional cap may be provided to cover each of the stimulator heads to protect the device when not in use to avoid accidental stimulation and to prevent material within the head from leaking or drying. Thus in this embodiment of the invention mechanical and electronic components of the stimulator impulse generator control unit and power source are compact portable and simple to operate.

Construction of different embodiments of the stimulator head is shown in more detail in . Referring now to the exploded view shown in the electrode head is assembled from a snap on cap that serves as a tambour for a dielectric or conducting membrane a disc without fenestration or alternatively with fenestration the head cup and the electrode which is also a screw . Two embodiments of the disc are shown. The preferred embodiment is a solid ordinarily uniformly conducting disc e.g. metal such as stainless steel which is possibly flexible in some embodiments. An alternate embodiment of the disc is also shown which is a non conducting e.g. plastic aperture screen that permits electrical current to pass through its apertures. The electrode also in seen in each stimulator head has the shape of a screw that is flattened on its tip. Pointing of the tip would make the electrode more of a point source such that equations for the electrical potential may have a solution corresponding more closely to a far field approximation. Rounding of the electrode surface or making the surface with another shape will likewise affect the boundary conditions. Completed assembly of the stimulator head is shown in which also shows how the head is attached to the body of the stimulator .

The membrane ordinarily serves as the interface shown as in . For example the membrane may be made of a dielectric non conducting material such as a thin sheet of Mylar biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate also known as BoPET . In other embodiments it may be made of conducting material such as a sheet of Tecophilic material from Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. In one embodiment shown in apertures of the alternate disc may be open or they may be plugged with conducting material for example KM10T hydrogel from Katecho Inc. 4020 Gannett Ave. Des Moines Iowa 50321. If the apertures are so plugged and the membrane is made of conducting material the membrane becomes optional and the plug serves as the interface shown in .

The head cup is filled with conducting material in for example SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004. The snap on cap aperture screen disc head cup and body of the stimulator are made of a non conducting material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The depth of the head cup from its top surface to the electrode may be between one and six centimeters. The head cup may have a different curvature than what is shown in or it may be tubular or conical or have some other inner surface geometry that will affect the Neumann boundary conditions of the corresponding electrical field equations.

The alternate embodiment of the stimulator head that is shown in also contains a snap on cap membrane that is made of a dielectric or a conducting material the head cup and the electrode which is also a screw . This alternate embodiment differs from the embodiment shown in in regard to the mechanical support that is provided to the membrane . Whereas the disc or had provided mechanical support to the membrane in the other embodiment in the alternate embodiment a reinforcing ring is provided to the membrane. That reinforcement ring rests on non conducting struts that are placed in the head cup and a non conducting strut ring is placed within notches in the struts to hold the struts in place. An advantage of the alternate embodiment is that without a disc or current flow may be less restricted through the membrane especially if the membrane is made of a conducting material. Furthermore although the struts and strut ring are made of non conducting material in this alternate embodiment the design may be adapted to position additional electrode or other conducting elements within the head cup for other more specialized configurations of the stimulator head the inclusion of which will influence the electric fields that are generated by the device. Completed assembly of the alternate stimulator head is shown in without showing its attachment to the body of the stimulator. In fact it is possible to insert a lead under the head of the electrode and many other methods of attaching the electrode to the signal generating electronics of the stimulator are known in the art.

If the membrane is made of conducting materials and the disc in is made of solid conducting materials such as stainless steel the membrane becomes optional and the disc serves as the interface shown in . Thus an embodiment without the membrane is shown in . shows that this version of the device comprises a solid but possibly flexible in some embodiments conducting disc that cannot absorb fluid the non conducting stimulator head into or onto which the disc is placed and the electrode which is also a screw. It is understood that the disc may have an anisotropic material or electrical structure for example wherein a disc of stainless steel has a grain such that the grain of the disc should be rotated about its location on the stimulator head in order to achieve optimal electrical stimulation of the patient. As seen in these items are assembled to become a sealed stimulator head that is attached to the body of the stimulator . The disc may screw into the stimulator head it may be attached to the head with adhesive or it may be attached by other methods that are known in the art. The chamber of the stimulator head cup is filled with a conducting gel fluid or paste and because the disc and electrode are tightly sealed against the stimulator head cup the conducting material within the stimulator head cannot leak out.

In some embodiments the interface and or its underlying mechanical support comprise materials that will also provide a substantial or complete seal of the interior of the device. This inhibits any leakage of conducting material such as gel from the interior of the device and also inhibits any fluids from entering the device. In addition this feature allows the user to easily clean the outer surface of the device e.g. with isopropyl alcohol or similar disinfectant avoiding potential contamination during subsequent uses of the device.

In some embodiments the interface comprises a fluid permeable material that allows for passage of current through the permeable portions of the material. In these embodiments a conductive medium such as a gel is preferably situated between the electrode s and the permeable interface. The conductive medium provides a conductive pathway for electrons to pass through the permeable interface to the outer surface of the interface and to the patient s skin.

In other embodiments of the present invention the interface in or in is made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as material used to make capacitors. For example it may be Mylar having a submicron thickness preferably in the range 0.5 to 1.5 microns having a dielectric constant of about 3. Because one side of Mylar is slick and the other side is microscopically rough the present invention contemplates two different configurations one in which the slick side is oriented towards the patient s skin and the other in which the rough side is so oriented. Thus at stimulation Fourier frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the dielectric interface will capacitively couple the signal through itself because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin. Thus the dielectric interface will isolate the stimulator s electrode from the tissue yet allow current to pass. In one embodiment of the present invention non invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is accomplished essentially substantially capacitively which reduces the amount of ohmic stimulation thereby reducing the sensation the patient feels on the tissue surface. This would correspond to a situation for example in which at least 30 preferably at least 50 of the energy stimulating the nerve comes from capacitive coupling through the stimulator interface rather than from ohmic coupling. In other words a substantial portion e.g. 50 of the voltage drop is across the dielectric interface while the remaining portion is through the tissue.

The selection of the material for the dielectric constant involves at least two important variables 1 the thickness of the interface and 2 the dielectric constant of the material. The thinner the interface and or the higher the dielectric constant of the material the lower the voltage drop across the dielectric interface and thus the lower the driving voltage required . For example with Mylar the thickness could be about 0.5 to 5 microns preferably about 1 micron with a dielectric constant of about 3. For a piezoelectric material like barium titanate or PZT lead zirconate titanate the thickness could be about 100 400 microns preferably about 200 microns or 0.2 mm because the dielectric constant is 1000.

One of the novelties of the embodiment that is a non invasive capacitive stimulator hereinafter referred to more generally as a capacitive electrode arises in that it uses a low voltage generally less than 100 volt power source which is made possible by the use of a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . In addition the capacitive electrode allows for the use of an interface that provides a more adequate seal of the interior of the device. The capacitive electrode may be used by applying a small amount of conductive material e.g. conductive gel as described above to its outer surface. In some embodiments it may also be used by contacting dry skin thereby avoiding the inconvenience of applying an electrode gel paste or other electrolytic material to the patient s skin and avoiding the problems associated with the drying of electrode pastes and gels. Such a dry electrode would be particularly suitable for use with a patient who exhibits dermatitis after the electrode gel is placed in contact with the skin Ralph J. COSKEY. Contact dermatitis caused by ECG electrode jelly. Arch Dermatol 113 1977 839 840 . The capacitive electrode may also be used to contact skin that has been wetted e.g. with tap water or a more conventional electrolyte material to make the electrode skin contact here the dielectric constant more uniform A L ALEXELONESCU G Barbero F C M Freire and R Merletti.

As described below capacitive biomedical electrodes are known in the art but when used to stimulate a nerve noninvasively a high voltage power supply is currently used to perform the stimulation. Otherwise prior use of capacitive biomedical electrodes has been limited to invasive implanted applications to non invasive applications that involve monitoring or recording of a signal but not stimulation of tissue to non invasive applications that involve the stimulation of something other than a nerve e.g. tumor or as the dispersive electrode in electrosurgery.

Evidence of a long felt but unsolved need and evidence of failure of others to solve the problem that is solved by the this embodiment of the present invention low voltage non invasive capacitive stimulation of a nerve is provided by KELLER and Kuhn who review the previous high voltage capacitive stimulating electrode of GEDDES et al and write that Capacitive stimulation would be a preferred way of activating muscle nerves and fibers when the inherent danger of high voltage breakdowns of the dielectric material can be eliminated. Goal of future research could be the development of improved and ultra thin dielectric foils such that the high stimulation voltage can be lowered. L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 25 1987 359 360 Thierry KELLER and Andreas Kuhn. Electrodes for transcutaneous surface electrical stimulation. Journal of Automatic Control University of Belgrade 18 2 2008 35 45 on page 39 . It is understood that in the United States according to the 2005 National Electrical Code high voltage is any voltage over 600 volts. U.S. Pat.

This embodiment of the present invention uses a different method to lower the high stimulation voltage than developing ultra thin dielectric foils namely to use a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . That waveform has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation as currently practiced. Thus one of ordinary skill in the art would not have combined the claimed elements because transcutaneous nerve stimulation is performed with waveforms having significant Fourier components only at lower frequencies and noninvasive capacitive nerve stimulation is performed at higher voltages. In fact the elements in combination do not merely perform the function that each element performs separately. The dielectric material alone may be placed in contact with the skin in order to perform pasteless or dry stimulation with a more uniform current density than is associated with ohmic stimulation albeit with high stimulation voltages L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 25 1987 359 360 Yongmin KIM H. Gunter Zieber and Frank A. Yang. Uniformity of current density under stimulating electrodes. Critical Reviews in Biomedical Engineering 17 1990 6 585 619 . With regard to the waveform element a waveform that has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms currently used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation may be used to selectively stimulate a deep nerve and avoid stimulating other nerves as disclosed herein for both noncapacitive and capacitive electrodes. But it is the combination of the two elements dielectric interface and waveform that makes it possible to stimulate a nerve capacitively without using the high stimulation voltage as is currently practiced.

Another embodiment of the electrode based stimulator is shown in showing a device in which electrically conducting material is dispensed from the device to the patient s skin. In this embodiment the interface in is the conducting material itself. respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the electrical stimulator . provides a bottom view of the stimulator after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.

Individual wires not shown connect the impulse generator in to the stimulator s electrodes . The two electrodes are shown here to be elliptical metal discs situated between the head compartment and rear compartment of the stimulator . A partition separates each of the two head compartments from one another and from the single rear compartment . Each partition also holds its corresponding electrode in place. However each electrode may be removed to add electrically conducting gel in to each head compartment . An optional non conducting variable aperture iris diaphragm may be placed in front of each of the electrodes within the head compartment in order to vary the effective surface area of each of the electrodes. Each partition may also slide towards the head of the device in order to dispense conducting gel through the mesh apertures . The position of each partition therefore determines the distance between its electrode and mesh openings which is variable in order to obtain the optimally uniform current density through the mesh openings . The outside housing of the stimulator as well as each head compartment housing and its partition are made of electrically insulating material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene so that the two head compartments are electrically insulated from one another. Although the embodiment in is shown to be a non capacitive stimulator it is understood that it may be converted into a capacitive stimulator by replacing the mesh openings with a dielectric material such as a sheet of Mylar or by covering the mesh openings with a sheet of such dielectric material.

In a preferred embodiment the magnetic stimulator coil in has a body that is similar to the electrode based stimulator shown in . To compare the electrode based stimulator with the magnetic stimulator refer to which shows the magnetic stimulator sectioned along its long axis to reveal its inner structure. As described below it reduces the volume of conducting material that must surround a toroidal coil by using two toroids side by side and passing electrical current through the two toroidal coils in opposite directions. In this configuration the induced electrical current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. Thus minimal space for the conducting medium is required around the outside of the toroids at positions near from the gap between the pair of coils. An additional advantage of using two toroids in this configuration is that this design will greatly increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them which is crucial for exciting long straight axons such as the vagus nerve and certain peripheral nerves.

As seen in a mesh has openings that permit a conducting gel within in to pass from the inside of the stimulator to the surface of the patient s skin at the location of nerve or tissue stimulation. Thus the mesh with openings is the part of the magnetic stimulator that is applied to the skin of the patient.

As also seen in the coils and cores around which they are wound are mounted as close as practical to the corresponding mesh with openings through which conducting gel passes to the surface of the patient s skin. As shown each coil and the core around which it is wound is mounted in its own housing the function of which is to provide mechanical support to the coil and core as well as to electrically insulate a coil from its neighboring coil. With this design induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. A difference between the structure of the electrode based stimulator shown in and the magnetic stimulator shown in is that the conducting gel is maintained within the chambers of the electrode based stimulator which is generally closed on the back side of the chamber because of the presence of the electrode but in the magnetic stimulator the hole of each toroidal core and winding is open permitting the conducting gel to enter the interconnected chambers .

Different diameter toroidal coils and windings may be preferred for different applications. For a generic application the outer diameter of the core may be typically 1 to 5 cm with an inner diameter typically 0.5 to 0.75 of the outer diameter. The coil s winding around the core may be typically 3 to 250 in number depending on the core diameter and depending on the desired coil inductance. The currents passing through the coils of the magnetic stimulator will saturate the core e.g. 0.1 to 2 Tesla magnetic field strength for Supermendur core material . This will require approximately 0.5 to 20 amperes of current being passed through each coil typically 2 amperes with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses as described in connection with .

No. 12 964 050 entitled Magnetic Stimulation Devices and Methods of Therapy to SIMON et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

One of the novelties of the designs shown in is that the stimulator along with a correspondingly suitable stimulation waveform shapes the electric field producing a selective physiological response by stimulating that nerve but avoiding substantial stimulation of nerves and tissue other than the target nerve particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain.

The remaining disclosure will be directed to methods for using the above disclosed electrode based and magnetic stimulation devices for treating atrial fibrillation including methods for detecting imminent AF onset and using the stimulation devices to avert the onset of that AF. The examples involve stimulating the patient on the surface of the patient s neck in order to stimulate one or both of the patient s vagus nerves. However it will be appreciated that the systems and methods of the present invention might be applied equally well to other nerves of the body including but not limited to parasympathetic nerves sympathetic nerves and spinal or cranial nerves.

Selected nerve fibers are stimulated in different embodiments of methods that make use of the disclosed electrical stimulation devices including stimulation of the vagus nerve at a location in the patient s neck. At that location the vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath near the carotid artery and the interior jugular vein. The carotid sheath is located at the lateral boundary of the retropharyngeal space on each side of the neck and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The left vagus nerve is sometimes selected for stimulation because stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce undesired effects on the heart but in the present application the right vagus nerve or both right and left vagus nerves may be stimulated instead.

The three major structures within the carotid sheath are the common carotid artery the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid artery lies medial to the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve is situated posteriorly between the two vessels. Typically the location of the carotid sheath or interior jugular vein in a patient and therefore the location of the vagus nerve will be ascertained in any manner known in the art e.g. by feel or ultrasound imaging. Proceeding from the skin of the neck above the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the vagus nerve a line may pass successively through the sternocleidomastoid muscle the carotid sheath and the internal jugular vein unless the position on the skin is immediately to either side of the external jugular vein. In the latter case the line may pass successively through only the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath before encountering the vagus nerve missing the interior jugular vein. Accordingly a point on the neck adjacent to the external jugular vein might be preferred for non invasive stimulation of the vagus nerve. The electrodes or magnetic stimulator coils may be centered on such a point at the level of about the fifth to sixth cervical vertebra.

The vagus nerve is identified in along with the carotid sheath that is identified there in bold peripheral outline. The carotid sheath encloses not only the vagus nerve but also the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery . Features that may be identified near the surface of the neck include the external jugular vein and the sternocleidomastoid muscle . Additional organs in the vicinity of the vagus nerve include the trachea thyroid gland esophagus scalenus anterior muscle and scalenus medius muscle . The sixth cervical vertebra is also shown in with bony structure indicated by hatching marks.

The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about the location indicated in until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position not shown in or .

The stimulation is then performed with a sinusoidal burst waveform like that shown in . The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period may be 200 microseconds the number of pulses per burst may be N 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period of T 40000 microseconds which is comparable to 25 Hz stimulation. More generally there may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of 20 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps preferably at 5 50 bps and even more preferably 10 25 bps stimulation 10 25 Hz . The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave although triangular or other shapes may be used as well. The stimulation is then performed typically for 30 minutes or until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved. However it is understood that parameters of the stimulation protocol may be varied in response to heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of patients.

The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to produce a therapeutic result in the patient which are adjusted on an individualized basis. The individualized selection of parameters for the nerve stimulation protocol may based on trial and error in order to obtain a beneficial response without the sensation of pain muscle twitches or other adverse side effects. Ordinarily the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient and to a level that does not cause a vagally induced slowing of the heart rate for patients who are in sinus rhythm or would not have caused such slowing for patients who are already experiencing AF. Then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted. It is understood that parameters may also be varied randomly in order to simulate normal physiological variability thereby possibly inducing a beneficial response in the patient Buchman T G. Nonlinear dynamics complex systems and the pathobiology of critical illness. Curr Opin Crit Care 10 5 2004 378 82 .

Individualized treatment may also be based on the methods that are described below in connection with the use of control theory to select stimulation parameters in which stimulation parameters can be varied automatically in response to noninvasive physiological signals that are acquired and analyzed ECG particularly analysis of the f wave in patients experiencing AF respiration motion detected by accelerometers etc . In order to motivate exemplary control rules that are disclosed below the neural control of the heart by the autonomic nervous system will first be described.

Both parasympathetic and sympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system have significant influences on the onset and maintenance of AF and the presence of AF may in turn modulate the autonomic nervous system Philippe COUMEL.

Direct infusion of acetylcholine into animal models can almost invariably induce AF but direct infusion of isoprenaline and adrenaline can induce AF in only approximately one fourth of such animals.

However such maneuvers may be unwieldy when compared with a vagal nerve stimulation protocol that allows simultaneous fine control over stimulus amplitude frequency pulse width etc. but those maneuvers may also be used in conjunction with electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve.

Control of the heart by the autonomic nervous system is illustrated in . Parasympathetic components particularly the vagus nerve are shown primarily on the left side of the figure and sympathetic components are shown primarily on the right side of the figure. The site of vagus nerve stimulation that is shown in corresponds to the site illustrated in . It is understood that there are left and right vagus nerves and that the sympathetic trunk also comprises paired bundles of nerve fibers but for simplicity only one side is shown in . Furthermore it is understood that the two sides may interact and show asymmetries for example such that stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce effects that differ from those obtained by stimulating the left vagus nerve.

Electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve will produce inhibit or modulate action potentials in both its afferent and efferent fibers unless the nerve stimulation parameters are selected in such a way as to preferentially stimulate particular fibers. Antidromic impulses might also be produced by stimulation of the vagus nerve. Efferent signals arising from stimulation of the vagus nerve may be superimposed upon or interact with the vagal efferent signals from the brainstem. The vagal afferent signals from the nerve stimulation as well as naturally occurring cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic afferent signals are conveyed to the brainstem and processed there As described below this results in the production of both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent signals from the control and integration centers of the brainstem. Those efferent signals are in turn conveyed through the deep and superficial cardiac plexuses which are then conveyed to the heart and its intrinsic nervous system.

Parasympathetic cells forming efferent fibers of the vagus nerve are located in nuclei of the brainstem comprising the dorsal nucleus of the vagus and the nucleus ambiguus and surrounding cells . Vagal efferent B fibers arising principally from the nucleus ambiguus and vagal efferent C fibers arising principally from the dorsal nucleus are thought to have different functions in controlling the heart. The vagus nerve originating in these nuclei forms successive branches that innervate the heart comprising the superior cervical vagal cardiac nerve the inferior cervical vagal cardiac nerve and the thoracic vagal cardiac nerve CHENG Z Zhang H Guo S Z Wurster R Gozal D.

The cells of the intermediolateral column in the thoracic spinal cord are the source of all the sympathetic efferent nerve fibers. They travel to ganglia before the corresponding postganglionic nerve reaches the target organ in this case the heart. Relevant ganglia and corresponding nerves some of which are shown in comprise the superior cervical ganglion superior cervical cardiac nerve the middle cervical ganglion middle cervical cardiac nerve the cervocothoracic stellate ganglion inferior cervical cardiac nerve and first through fourth thoracic sympathetic ganglion thoracic sympathetic cardiac nerves Van STEE E W.

Nearly all parasympathetic afferent nerve signals reach the nucleus tractus solitarus NTS or nucleus of the solitary tract of the central nervous system via the vagus nerve. Like all sensory afferents the actual cell bodies of the neurons lie just outside the central nervous system in a ganglion which for the vagus nerve is the nodose ganglion. The central processes of the neurons enter the medulla in the solitary tract and travel a short distance before making a synapse in the surrounding nucleus of the solitary tract. The sympathetic afferents reenter the dorsal horn of the spinal cord from levels C7 to T4 notably at the same level as those from the shoulder region such that shoulder and cardiac pain is sometimes indistinguishable. Information about the status of the heart is conveyed by these parasympathetic and sympathetic afferent nerves to the brainstem where it is integrated along with autonomic information about respiration body temperature etc. to produce corresponding efferent cardiac signals.

Much of the integration of autonomic information is performed in the NTS parabrachial nucleus PBN and Edinger Westphal nucleus EW . As shown in the NTS projects to the PBN and the PBN projects to the EW. Within the brain stem integration of autonomic activity may occur via pathways that project a from EW to PBN b from PBN to NTS c from NTS to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus PVN and d from PVN to EW. Pathways that descend from brain stem centers of autonomic integration to the spinal cord originate in the EW NTS and PVN LEOWY A. D. Burton H. 1978.

Edinger Westphal nucleus projections to the brain stem and spinal cord in the cat. Brain Res. 150 1 27 . Additional integration of sympathetic information may be through local circuits involving feedback via the superior middle and or stellate ganglia back to the spinal cord through the dorsal root ganglia.

A significant amount of integration of autonomic information also occurs in the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system which is estimated to contain more than 14 000 neurons. As illustrated in the intrinsic system is a complex neural network containing ganglia and their associated axons which are concentrated within epicardial fat pads in plexi i.e. ganglionated plexi. In humans the plexi are observed consistently in five atrial and five ventricular regions but occasional ganglia of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system are also located in other atrial and ventricular regions. The ganglia range in size from some containing a few neurons to large ganglia measuring up to 0.5 1 mm ARMOUR J A Murphy D A Yuan B X Macdonald S Hopkins D A.

Postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic cholinergic nerves affect cardiac muscarinic receptors shown as M in to represent the five principal types of cardiac muscarinic receptors which have multiple effects such as activating acetylcholine regulated potassium current and modifying sympathetic inputs. Also through such ganglia the sympathetic nervous system activates cardiac adrenergic receptors shown as in to represent the several cardiac and adrenergic receptors which have multiple effects such as modifying parasympathetic inputs and activating second messengers. However the neurochemistry of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system is complicated by the fact that half of their cholinergic neurons may have a dual cholinergic noradrenergic phenotype. In addition to nerve transmissions involving acetylcholine and norepinephrine other modulators such as neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal peptide are also involved HOARD J L Hoover D B Mabe A M Blakely R D Feng N Paolocci N.

The intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system is not simply a relay station for extrinsic autonomic nerve projections to and from the heart. It is instead a local integrative neural network that can modulate external nervous signals sent to and from the heart HOU Y Scherlag B J Lin J Zhang Y Lu Z Truong K Patterson E Lazzara R Jackman W M Po S S. Ganglionated plexi modulate extrinsic cardiac autonomic nerve input effects on sinus rate atrioventricular conduction refractoriness and inducibility of atrial fibrillation. Am Coll Cardiol 50 1 2007 61 8 . The intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system can also act independently and reflexively in response to local cardiac signals thereby acting as a little brain on the heart . In fact in transplanted hearts that have no external innervations until new nerve fibers sprout the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system nevertheless maintains a degree of control over cardiac functions. In that case the only remaining sources of external control are humoral particularly circulating catecholamines. Furthermore atrial fibrillation can be induced by electrically stimulating only ganglionated plexi of the intrinsic nervous system or by injecting acetylcholine directly into them SCHERLAG B J Po S.

In summary the neural control of the heart that is shown in is hierarchical with interacting integrative circuits at different levels from the brainstem to the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system. It is no longer thought that thoracic and intrinsic cardiac ganglia simply act as relay stations. Instead the various populations of neurons constantly interact with one another and with central neurons to form reflexes of varied latency that control spatially determined but overlapping regions of the heart. Short latency 20 40 millisecond reflexes may involve primarily the intrinsic cardiac ganglia medium latency 100 200 millisecond reflexes may involve thoracic ganglia and longer latency reflexes may involve the spinal cord and brainstem ARMOUR J A.

Although particular cardiac regions are subserved by nearby cardiac intrinsic ganglia the interactions among cardiac ganglia and interactions with components of the extrinsic nervous system with which they are in communication are such that it generally may not be possible to modulate a particular cardiac region by stimulating or ablating a small number of particular autonomic nerve fibers. This is because stimulation of many different ganglia of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system may have a significant effect on any particular cardiac region. For example vagal reflexes involving ganglia around the junction between the left atrium and pulmonary vein are thought to induce and perpetuate AF but counter intuitively ablation of nerves at that location increases rather decreases the inducibility of AF HIROSE M Leatmanoratn Z Laurita K R Carlson M D. Partial vagal denervation increases vulnerability to vagally induced atrial fibrillation. Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 13 12 2002 1272 9 . This may be due to a problem inherent in the use of ablation because it necessarily involves the destruction of sympathetic fibers even when it is desired to ablate only parasympathetic fibers Demosthenes G KATRITSIS. Autonomic Denervation for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation. Indian Pacing Electrophysiol J. 11 6 2011 161 166 . Furthermore the ablation may increase inhomogeneity of refractoriness which contributes to the inducibility of AF.

However the failure of such localized ablation may also be attributable in part to the fact that many different ganglia of the heart may have a significant effect on that particular cardiac region. Thus the majority of neurons in the mammalian heart display cholinergic properties and branches of vagus nerves are distributed to all parts of both atria such that stimulation of vagus branches innervating different portions of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system may also affect the portion of the heart nearest nerves that are ablated LEGER J Croll R P Smith F M. Regional distribution and extrinsic innervation of intrinsic cardiac neurons in the guinea pig. Comp Neurol. 407 3 1999 303 17 . Furthermore even if ablation of a larger and more dispersed number of ganglia were to reduce the inducibility of AF this would only be a temporary solution because the nerves of the heart are capable of rapidly re innervating the ablated regions SAKAMOTO S Schuessler R B Lee A M Aziz A Lall S C Damiano R J Jr. Vagal denervation and reinnervation after ablation of ganglionated plexi. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 139 2 2010 444 52 . Thus KAPA et al. write that . . . while the intrinsic cardiac nervous system partly mediated by signals received from the extrinsic cardiac nerves and partly by more local signals received from the heart may play an integral role in the inducibility and propagation of AF ways to use the data most appropriately are unclear KAPA S Venkatachalam K L Asirvatham S J. The autonomic nervous system in cardiac electrophysiology an elegant interaction and emerging concepts. Cardiol Rev 18 6 2010 275 84 .

Low level vagus nerve stimulation therefore offers a potentially better therapy for AF than ablation of cardiac ganglia if it can simultaneously modulate the activities of many interacting ganglia of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system in such a way that those ganglia collectively modify the electrophysiological properties of the particular regions of the heart in which actual or potential reentrant circuits or ectopic foci exist. In general an objective of the low level vagal nerve stimulation is to impede or reverse the electrophysiological changes in the atria that would cause high level vagal nerve stimulation to induce AF. Such high level vagal nerve stimulation is thought to shorten conduction velocity action potential duration APD and atrial effective refractory period ERP non uniformly contributing to spatial ERP dispersion and enhance ectopic focal firing from sites such as the pulmonary vein superior vena cava vein of Marshall and atrial appendages. The high level vagal nerve stimulation may also indirectly and reflexly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system to reduce atrial refractoriness and induce trigger activity in ectopic foci.

The present invention discloses methods for selecting parameters of the low level vagus nerve stimulation in such a way as to achieve objectives listed in the previous paragraph. By low level we mean that the amplitude of the stimulus signal shown in should ordinarily be set to a value less than or equal to a default value that would begin to decrease the heart rate for a patient in normal sinus rhythm. An amplitude higher than the default may also be used but this is not preferred because it risks inducing or maintaining AF as indicated in the previous paragraph. An amplitude lower than the default decreases such a risk but it has the disadvantage that the vagus nerve stimulation may need to be performed in a session having a longer duration than would be the case with the default amplitude in order to achieve a therapeutic result. However an advantage of using a lower amplitude than the default may be that it could preferentially stimulate certain nerve fibers e.g. B versus C fibers .

Parameters of the stimulation are selected to modulate electrophysiological properties of particular regions of the heart in AF by influencing the amplitude and frequency of fibrillatory waves that may be extracted and measured in the AF patient s electrocardiogram. By selecting particular electrocardiographic leads for analysis it is possible to preferentially extract electrophysiological characteristics of the corresponding portions of the atria. For example ECG leads I Vand aVL preferentially characterize left atrial activity leads II III and aVpreferentially characterize activity of the inferior atrial surface or coronary sinus and leads V V and aVR preferentially characterize right atrial activity RAVI K C Krummen D E Tran A J Bulling a J R Narayan S M. Electrocardiographic measurements of regional atrial fibrillation cycle length. Pacing Clin Electrophysiol 32 Suppl 1 2009 566 71 . The fourier spectrum of the fibrillatory waves extracted from one such set of leads say corresponding to the left atrium may be characterized as having a dominant peak centered a particular frequency and having a measurable width. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the frequency of the vagus nerve stimulation is set to a multiple of that f wave peak frequency. For example if the f wave frequency corresponding to the dominant left atrial peak is 6.7 cycles per second the number of bursts per second of the vagal nerve stimulator may be set to approximately 6.7 13.4 20.1 or 26.8 etc. in an attempt to entrain the vagal stimulation with the f wave. This procedure contrasts with previous methods of invasive vagal nerve stimulation which stimulate at fixed predetermined frequencies.

Having set the stimulation frequency the number of sinusoidal impulses per burst default 5 and the duration of an impulse default 200 microseconds may be varied about their default values in an attempt to modulate and preferably capture the dominant peak of the f wave spectrum. Capturing of the peak will have occurred for example when the peak width narrows and the frequency corresponding to the dominant peak can be decreased by deliberately decreasing the number of bursts per second of the vagus nerve stimulator. Such a decrease in frequency may have to be performed slowly over the course of many minutes because it may correspond to the AF slowly losing reentrant wavelets one by one. At some point the frequency may be small enough that the AF is unable to sustain itself at which time the heart would revert to normal sinus rhythm. If the AF terminates stimulation of the vagus nerve may be stopped or it may be continued for a period of time to allow the atrium to be remodeled to become a more normal electrophysiological substrate. If continued stimulation is performed the situation becomes what is described below in connection with the forecasting of the onset of AF. In that situation there are no f waves to monitor but instead heart rate variability indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone are measured along with indices concerning P wave morphology duration and dispersion and indices related to the frequency of atrial premature beats. The stimulation may then be continued until such indices approach values that are considered to be acceptable.

If there are more than one significant peaks in the f wave spectrum the procedure may be as described above with an attempt to capture the peak with the highest frequency followed by an attempt to capture the next to the highest peak etc. Alternatively one may attempt to capture the more than one peak simultaneously by stimulating the vagus nerve with superimposed waveforms like the ones shown in wherein the superimposed waveforms have different parameter values e.g. different frequencies corresponding to different peaks of the electrocardiogram s spectrum. The procedure may also be performed successively for spectra corresponding to different sets of ECG leads in an attempt to capture or modulate the spectral peaks corresponding to successive regions of the atria.

In some embodiments of the invention the amplitude of the stimulation may also be varied so as to preferentially stimulate particular vagus nerve fibers although the maximum allowed amplitude would generally be constrained not to decrease the heart rate of an individual in normal sinus rhythm. For example this may involve carefully graded increases in stimulus amplitude to activate the largest diameter fibers in the vagus nerve followed by gradual recruitment of smaller fibers as the amplitude is increased.

In other embodiments of the invention parameters of the stimulation may be modulated in synchrony with events that are known to influence or be influenced by the autonomic nervous system. Examples of such events involve respiration e.g. end of inspiration end of expiration or ventricular contraction e.g. with resetting of the stimulation at a fixed time after each QRS complex of the electrocardiogram .

As shown in the autonomic nervous system also influences the heart through circulating catecholamines. The electrical field delivered to the vagus nerve by the device s of the prevent invention may stimulate the release of hormones into the circulation at concentrations that affect the onset and or termination of AF but that have little effect on heart rate or blood pressure. In one embodiment of the present invention the release of catecholamines is accomplished by generating a parasympathetic afferent vagal signal to the brain which then triggers an efferent sympathetic signal to stimulate the release of catecholamines from the adrenal glands. In animal studies demonstrating the effects of vagal stimulation data have indicated that applicant s device s can stimulate such release even if the vagus nerve is tied off distal to the electrode and that the effects can be blocked with the blocker propranolol. In addition such stimulation is ineffective in animals that have had their adrenal glands removed an endogenous source of these catecholamines SIMON B J Emala C W Lewis L M Theodoro D Purim Shem Tov Y Sepulveda P Hoffmann T J Staats P.

Although the methods described above may be performed manually by the operator of the vagus nerve stimulator they also lend themselves to automatic control. If it is desired to temporarily or permanently maintain a constant stimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve for example to perform stimulation with the amplitude maintained at the default level as described above methods of control theory may be employed to modulate the power of the stimulator in order to compensate for patient motion or other mechanisms that would otherwise give rise to variability in the power of stimulation. In the case of stimulation of the vagus nerve such variability may be attributable in part to the patient s breathing which may involve contraction and associated change in geometry of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that is situated close to the vagus nerve identified as in .

The System also receives input from the Controller which in this case may comprise the vagus nerve stimulation device as well as electronic components that may be used to select or set parameters for the stimulation protocol amplitude frequency pulse width burst number etc. or alert the patient as to the need to use the stimulator i.e. an alarm . For example the controller may include the control unit in . Feedback in the schema shown in is possible because physiological measurements of the System are made using sensors. Thus the values of variables of the system that could be measured define the system s state the System Output . As a practical matter only some of those measurements are actually made and they represent the Sensed Physiological Input to the Controller.

The preferred sensors will be ones ordinarily used for ambulatory monitoring selected to characterize the heart and the modulation of its function by the autonomic nervous system. For example the sensors may comprise those used in conventional Holter and bedside monitoring applications for monitoring heart rate ECG respiration core temperature hydration blood pressure brain function oxygenation and skin temperature. The sensors may be embedded in garments or placed in sports wristwatches as currently used in programs that monitor the physiological status of soldiers G. A. Shaw A. M. Siegel G. Zogbi and T. P. Opar. Warfighter physiological and environmental monitoring a study for the U.S. Army Research Institute in Environmental Medicine and the Soldier Systems Center. MIT Lincoln Laboratory Lexington Mass. 1 Nov. 2004 pp. 1 141 . The ECG sensors should be adapted to the automatic extraction and analysis of particular features of the ECG for example the fibrillatory waves that were described above in connection with the characterization of AF and for patients in normal sinus rhythm indices of P wave morphology as well as indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone. Measurement of respiration using noninvasive inductive plethysmography mercury in silastic strain gauges or impedance pneumography is particularly advised in order to account for the effects of respiration on the heart. A noninvasive accelerometer may also be included among the ambulatory sensors in order to identify motion artifacts. Although AF can be detected from the ECG alone an event marker may also be included in order for the patient to mark relevant circumstances and sensations.

Let the measured output variables of the system be denoted by y i 1 to Q let the desired reference or setpoint values of ybe denoted by rand let the controller s input to the system consist of variables u j 1 to P . The objective is for a controller to select the input uin such a way that the output variables or a subset of them closely follows the reference signals r i.e. the control error e r yis small even if there is environmental input or noise to the system. Consider the error function e r yto be the sensed physiological input to the controller in i.e. the reference signals are integral to the controller which subtracts the measured system values from them to construct the control error signal . The controller will also receive a set of measured environmental signals v k 1 to R which also act upon the system as shown in .

The functional form of the system s input u t is constrained to be as shown in . Ordinarily a parameter that needs adjusting is the one associated with the amplitude of the signal shown in . As a first example of the use of feedback to control the system consider the problem of adjusting the input u t from the vagus nerve stimulator i.e. output from the controller in order to compensate for motion artifacts.

Nerve activation is generally a function of the second spatial derivative of the extracellular potential along the nerve s axon which would be changing as the position of the stimulator varies relative to the axon F. RATTAY. The basic mechanism for the electrical stimulation of the nervous system. Neuroscience 89 2 1999 335 346 . Such motion artifact can be due to movement by the patient e.g. neck movement or movement within the patient e.g. sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction associated with respiration or it can be due to movement of the stimulator relative to the body slippage or drift . Thus one expects that because of such undesired or unavoidable motion there will usually be some error e r y in the intended r versus actual y nerve stimulation amplitude that needs continuous adjustment.

Accelerometers can be used to detect all these types of movement using for example Model LSM330DL from STMicroelectronics 750 Canyon Dr 300 Coppell Tex. 75019. One or more accelerometer is attached to the patient s neck and one or more accelerometer is attached to the head of the stimulator in the vicinity of where the stimulator contacts the patient. Because the temporally integrated outputs of the accelerometers provide a measurement of the current position of each accelerometer the combined accelerometer outputs make it possible to measure any movement of the stimulator relative to the underlying tissue.

The location of the vagus nerve underlying the stimulator may be determined preliminarily by placing an ultrasound probe at the location where the center of the stimulator will be placed Knappertz V A Tegeler C H Hardin S J McKinney W M. Vagus nerve imaging with ultrasound anatomic and in vivo validation. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 118 1 1998 82 5 . The ultrasound probe is configured to have the same shape as the stimulator including the attachment of one or more accelerometer. As part of the preliminary protocol the patient with accelerometers attached is then instructed to perform neck movements breathe deeply so as to contract the sternocleidomastoid muscle and generally simulate possible motion that may accompany up to several hours of stimulation with the stimulator. This would include possible slippage or movement of the stimulator relative to an initial position on the patient s neck. While these movements are being performed the accelerometers are acquiring position information and the corresponding location of the vagus nerve is determined from the ultrasound image. With these preliminary data it is then possible to infer the location of the vagus nerve relative to the stimulator given only the accelerometer data during a stimulation session by interpolating between the previously acquired vagus nerve position data as a function of accelerometer position data.

For any given position of the stimulator relative to the vagus nerve it is also possible to infer the amplitude of the electric field that it produces in the vicinity of the vagus nerve. This is done by calculation or by measuring the electric field that is produced by the stimulator as a function of depth and position within a phantom that simulates the relevant bodily tissue Francis Marion Moore. Electrical Stimulation for pain suppression mathematical and physical models. Thesis School of Engineering Cornell University 2007 Bartosz SAWICKI Robert Szmurto Przemystaw Ptonecki Jacek Starzynski Stanislaw Wincenciak Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam IOS Press 2008 . Thus in order to compensate for movement the controller may increase or decrease the amplitude of the output from the stimulator u in proportion to the inferred deviation of the amplitude of the electric field in the vicinity of the vagus nerve relative to its desired value.

As another example of automatic control we disclose adjustment of the parameters of the vagus nerve stimulation in such a way as to control the frequency of the dominant peak s in the Fourier spectrum of the f waves that are found in the electrocardiogram of atrial fibrillation patients. The methods described above considered the dominant peak to be stationary but in actuality the peak s may fluctuate in regards to their central frequency and width. Therefore the present invention contemplates the use of feedback and feedforward methods of control theory to adapt the stimulation parameters to changing characteristics of the patient s atrial electrocardiogram. Such control theory methods have been used in other neuromodulation applications but have been not been described in connection with the measurement and control of f waves. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7 403 820 entitled Closed loop feedback driven neuromodulation to DiLorenzo discloses the use of feedback to construct neuromodulation parameters but only for the treatment of neurological disorders. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 690 681 and 5 916 239 both entitled Method and apparatus using vagal stimulation for control of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation to Geddes et al. describe closed loop variable frequency vagal stimulation apparatus for control of ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. TOSATO et al and ZHOU et al also describe closed loop systems for control of the heart rate by stimulating a vagus nerve TOSATO M Yoshida K Toft E Nekrasas V Struijk J J. Closed loop control of the heart rate by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. Med Biol Eng Comput 44 3 2006 161 9 Yuxuan ZHOU Yuan Yuan Juan Gao Ling Yang Feng Zhang Guoqing Zhu Xingya Gao. An Implanted Closed loop Chip System for Heart Rate Control System Design and Effects in Conscious Rats. Journal of Biomedical Research 24 2 2010 107 114 . However they all differ from the closed loop variable frequency stimulation of the present invention in that the present invention monitors and controls atrial contractions f waves not ventricular contraction. Furthermore those investigators disclose implantable not noninvasive devices.

For present purposes no distinction is made between a system output variable and a variable representing the state of the system. Then a state space representation or model of the system consists of a set of first order differential equations of the form d y dt F t y u v r where t is time and where in general the rate of change of each variable yis a function F of many other output variables as well as the input and environmental signals.

Classical control theory is concerned with situations in which the functional form of Fis as a linear combination of the state and input variables but in which coefficients of the linear terms are not necessarily known in advance. In this linear case the differential equations may be solved with linear transform e.g. Laplace transform methods which convert the differential equations into algebraic equations for straightforward solution. Thus for example a single input single output system dropping the subscripts on variables may have input from a controller of the form 

Although classical control theory works well for linear systems having one or only a few system variables special methods have also been developed for systems in which the system is nonlinear i.e. the state space representation contains nonlinear differential equations or multiple input output variables. Such methods are important for the present invention because the physiological system to be controlled will be generally nonlinear and there will generally be multiple output physiological signals. It is understood that those methods may also be implemented in the controller shown in Torkel GLAD and Lennart Ljung. Control Theory. Multivariable and Nonlinear Methods. New York Taylor and Francis 2000 Zdzislaw BUBNICKI. Modern Control Theory. Berlin Springer 2005 .

Optimal selection of the parameters of a PID controller could be through calculation if the coefficients of the corresponding state differential equation were known in advance. However they are ordinarily not known so selection of the controller parameters tuning is accomplished by experiments in which the error e either is or is not used to form the system input respectively closed loop or open loop experiments . In an open loop experiment the input is increased in a step or random binary sequence of steps and the system response is measured. In a closed loop experiment the integral and derivative gains are set to zero the proportional gain is increased until the system starts to oscillate and the period of oscillation is measured. Depending on whether the experiment is open or closed loop the selection of PID parameter values may then be made according to rules that were described initially by Ziegler and Nichols. There are also many improved versions of tuning rules including some that can be implemented automatically by the controller LI Y. Ang K. H. and Chong G. C. Y.

Commercial versions of PID controllers are available and they are used in 90 of all control applications. In the present invention PID control is generally not needed to adjust the stimulator s number of bursts per second because the controller can simply measure the changing dominant frequency in the atrial electrocardiogram and immediately change the bursts per second of the stimulator accordingly. However control of the width of the dominant peak in the atrial electrocardiogram would benefit from the use of a PID controller wherein it is desired to maintain or decrease the width in an attempt to capture the dominant peak the measured width being the y in the error e r y and r being the desired width. In that case the number of pulses per burst and or the duration of a pulse may be varied by the tuned PID controller in an attempt to minimize the error.

Performance of system control can be improved by combining the feedback closed loop control of a PID controller with feed forward control wherein knowledge about the system s future behavior can be fed forward and combined with the output of the PID or other type of feedback controller to improve the overall system performance. For example if the sensed environmental input in is such the environmental input to the system will have a deleterious effect on the system after a delay the controller may use this information to provide anticipatory control input to the system so as to avert or mitigate the deleterious effects that would have been sensed only after the fact with a feedback only controller. Thus the controller shown in will generally make use of feed forward methods Coleman BROSILOW Babu Joseph. Feedforward Control Chapter 9 In Techniques of Model Based Control. Upper Saddle River N.J. Prentice Hall PTR 2002. pp 221 240 . It is a type of predictive controller methods for which have been developed in many contexts such as when a model of the system is used to calculate future outputs of the system with the objective of choosing among possible inputs so as to optimize a criterion that is based on future values of the system s output variables.

The present invention is concerned with two types of forecasting feed forward problems 1 The patient is in AF and is being stimulated with the stimulator and prediction of the termination of AF is made and or prediction of the time course of the f wave is predicted and 2 The patient is normal sinus rhythm and prediction of imminent AF is made in order to avert its onset. The latter embodiment of the present invention comprises the following steps. Components of the device that are used to make the forecast of imminent AF are worn by the patient. Note that the forecasting task does not in general necessitate wearing the vagal nerve stimulator for a patient in normal sinus rhythm. The forecasting components of the device then predict the imminent onset of atrial fibrillation using data obtained from an electrocardiogram plus accessory noninvasive data e.g. respiration and motion for example as described in publications such as the ones cited below. When the device sounds the alarm the patient or a caregiver then performs noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation to avert the AF. The prophylactic stimulation protocol comprises low level right side or both side vagal stimulation. If the patient has been previously treated with the stimulator while in AF parameters of the prophylactic stimulation may be set to their previously effective values. Otherwise the stimulation parameters may be set to values that are motivated by measurements of characteristics of the patient s heart rate variability or P waves as described below in connection with the forecasting of imminent AF.

A mathematical model of the system is needed in order to perform the predictions of system behavior. Models that are completely based upon physical first principles white box are rare especially in the case of physiological systems. Instead most models that make use of prior structural and mechanistic understanding of the system are so called grey box models. Such grey box models of atrial fibrillation exist Elizabeth M.

Atrial fibrillatory cycle length computer simulation and potential clinical importance. Europace 9 Suppl 6 2007 vi64 70 . However currently available grey box models need to be extended in order to accommodate predictions concerning the effects on AF by the vagus nerve stimulation of the present invention as now described.

The grey box models most closely related to present objectives are those described by VIGMOND et al. and by VALASCO. VIGMOND et al. constructed mathematical models of the effects of vagally induced heterogeneity of action potential duration on reentry initiated by an ectopic beat in which the atrium was modeled in a morphologically realistic manner. For small vagal stimulation acetylcholine release the reentry was as a figure of 8. For larger amplitude stimulation rotor behavior was observed. For large amplitude vagus stimulation reentry stabilized in the left atrium around the pulmonary veins in the right atrium it anchored to the caval veins. VIGMOND et al. noted however that their initial assumptions were ad hoc because vagal mapping over the whole organ is not available VIGMOND EJ Tsoi V Kuo S Arevalo H Kneller J Nattel S Trayanova N. The effect of vagally induced dispersion of action potential duration on atrial arrhythmogenesis. Heart Rhythm 1 3 2004 334 44 . This work was expanded by VALASCO but he too did not consider the effects of low level vagus nerve stimulation in atria already experiencing AF Mauricio Munoz VALASCO. Onset of atrial arrhythmias by autonomic neural stimulation and their termination a simulation study. 2009 Thesis. University of Calgary. Calgary Alberta . These models were derived from one described by KNELLER et al which in turn was derived from earlier ones that were inspired by one described by COURTEMANCHE et al KNELLER J Zou R Vigmond E J Wang Z Leon U Nattel S. Cholinergic atrial fibrillation in a computer model of a two dimensional sheet of canine atrial cells with realistic ionic properties. Circ Res 90 9 2002 E73 87 COURTEMANCHE M Ramirez R J Nattel S.

The above cited grey box models describe the electrophysiology of only the atrium itself so that additional calculation must be performed in order to obtain the corresponding surface atrial electrocardiogram which is what is actually extracted from noninvasive ECG measurement. The atrial electrocardiogram may be construction from the above cited grey box models using known methods JACQUEMET V van Oosterom A Vesin J M Kappenberger L. Analysis of electrocardiograms during atrial fibrillation. A biophysical model approach. IEEE Eng Med Biol Mag 25 6 2006 79 88 .

For the present invention the above cited models may be used or they may be adapted to make use of other computational platforms Oleg V ASLANIDI Michael A Colman Jonathan Stott Halina Dobrzynski Mark R Boyett Arun V Holden and Henggui Zhang. 3D virtual human atria A computational platform for studying clinical atrial fibrillation. Prog Biophys Mol Biol 107 1 2011 156 168 . However a major deficiency of those models is that they do not include a suitable representation of the spatial distribution within the atria of acetylcholine activity which depends not only on the spatial distribution of projections of the vagus nerve to the atria but also how the intrinsic cardiac autonomic nervous system will modulate that acetylcholine activity as a function of vagus nerve stimulation parameters amplitude burst frequency sinusoidal pulses per burst pulse width . Thus let the symbol j index ganglionated plexi in the atria or individual ganglia in an enlarged model and let A j 1 to 5 if only the ganglionated plexi are modeled denote the acetylcholine activity of the jth plexus. The variables Amay be inserted into the model of VIGMOND et al at their corresponding anatomical locations but it remains to model how the Aof the different ganglionated plexi interact with one another. To that end construct a general purpose representation such as

Many of the values of the model s parameters may then be set to ones that were assigned by VIGMOND et al but the others have to be estimated from data. Thus for a given set of vagus stimulation parameter values the electrocardiogram of a patient is measured and the model s parameters are estimated from the electrocardiogram data using existing methods such as the multiple shooting and recursive e.g. Kalman filter approaches Henning U. VOSS and Jens Timmer. Nonlinear dynamical system identification from uncertain and indirect measurements. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos 14 6 2004 1905 1933 or synchronization methods HDI ABARBANEL DR Creveling and J M Jeanne. Estimation of parameters in nonlinear systems using balanced synchronization. Physical Review E 77 2008 016208 pp 1 14 .

The process of estimating the model s parameters then has to be repeated for many other sets of stimulation parameters so as to complete the identification of the system. Once the model s parameters have been so estimated the electrophysiological state of the atria may be forecast from the model by calculation and the electrocardiogram corresponding to that forecasted state would also be calculated. In fact the forecast may be made with many different sets of potential stimulation parameter values in an attempt to find the set of parameter values that would terminate the AF or at least reduce the fibrillatory frequency. Thus by using such feedforward methods the controller shown in may achieve therapeutic results superior to the use of feedback alone. Note that such a model would also be useful for diagnostic purposes because after fitting the model s parameters calculating the state of the atrium as a function of time will reveal the number and location of reentrant wavelets and ectopic foci which is not currently possible using available diagnostic tools.

If the physiological mechanisms are not sufficiently validated to use a grey box model a black box or ad hoc forecasting model may be used instead. Ad hoc methods include those cited above in connection with the clinical decision regarding whether AF will self terminate except that for the present invention the methods would be applied to training sets of electrocardiograms that had been collected while vagus nerve stimulation was in progress.

For the present invention a grey box model is preferred but if a black box model must be used instead the preferred model will be one that makes use of support vector machines. A support vector machine SVM is an algorithmic approach to the problem of classification within the larger context of supervised learning. In the present context a training set of physiological data will have been acquired that includes whether or not the patient is experiencing AF. Thus the classification of the patient s state is whether or not the AF is in progress and the data used to make the classification consist of the remaining acquired physiological data ECG along with simultaneous data from other sensors such as for respiration and accelerometry for motion artifact as well as parameters of the stimulator device if it is currently being used on a patient in AF evaluated at time units prior to the time at which the binary AF yes no data are acquired. Thus for a patient who is in AF the SVM is trained to forecast the termination of AF time units into the future and the training set includes the time course of features extracted from the ECG including the atrial fibrillatory waveform and features extracted from it such as the dominant peak frequency and its width as described above. For a patient who is not in AF the SVM is trained to forecast the imminence of AF time units into the future and the training set includes the time course of features extracted from the ECG including heart rate variability indices of autonomic balance P wave duration and morphology and the frequency of atrial premature beats as described below. After training the SVM it is implemented as part of the controller. For patients in normal sinus rhythm the controller may sound an alarm and advise the use of vagal nerve stimulation whenever there is a forecast of imminent AF Christopher J. C. BURGES.

Several methods have been proposed to predict the imminent onset of atrial fibrillation in a patient who is currently in sinus rhythm G B MOODY A L Goldberger S McClennen S P Swiryn. Predicting the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001. Computers in Cardiology 28 2001 113 116 . Note that predictions according to the present invention may be better than previous ones because they may be based on the analysis of many simultaneous physiological signals. At a minimum the prediction is made from an analysis of an electrocardiogram of the patient over an extended period of time which requires the patient to have attached monitoring devices or wear them in sports watches or special clothing even though the patient is not necessarily wearing the vagal nerve stimulator. Measurement of respiration using noninvasive inductive plethysmography mercury in silastic strain gauges or impedance pneumography is also advised in order to account for the effects of respiration on the heart rate. A noninvasive accelerometer may also be included among the ambulatory sensors in order to account for motion artifacts and although AF can be detected from the ECG alone an event marker may also be included in order for the patient to mark relevant circumstances and sensations.

If the patient in normal sinus rhythm has been previously treated with the stimulator while in AF parameters of the prophylactic stimulation may be set to their previously effective values. Otherwise the stimulation parameters may be set to values that are motivated by measurements of characteristics of the patient s heart rate variability P waves or atrial premature beat frequency. According to the above cited methods the forecast of imminent AF may be triggered because sympathetic versus parasympathetic tone is unbalanced as evidenced by analysis of heart rate variability which involves the measurement of low versus high frequency components of the fourier transform of heart rate as determined from measured R R intervals e.g. BETTONI M Zimmermann M. Autonomic tone variations before the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Circulation 105 23 2002 2753 9 . The forecast of imminent AF may also be triggered because the frequency of atrial premature beats also increases and or the dispersion and morphology of the corresponding P waves change e.g. HAYN D Kollmann A Schreier G. Predicting initiation and termination of atrial fibrillation from the ECG. Biomed Tech 52 1 2007 5 10 . Normal setpoint values for indices concerning the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone atrial premature beat frequency and P wave morphology and duration may be assumed from values found in the literature or they may be measured for each patient while the patient is in normal sinus rhythm. The controller with vagus nerve stimulator attached may be tuned by preliminarily stimulating the patient to determine the effect that the stimulation has on the values of those indices for given sets of stimulator parameter values. Such indices will normally fluctuate so after tuning the stimulator may then be used to continuously and automatically stimulate the patient to minimize the error between the fluctuating index values and their setpoints. The invention contemplates that such feedback control could involve variation in any of the stimulator s parameters including the amplitude of the stimulation signal although the maximum allowed amplitude would generally be constrained not to decrease the heart rate of an individual in normal sinus rhythm.

However in the preferred embodiment of the invention for averting AF the nerve stimulator would not be used continuously to maintain the fluctuating index values to within a range about the setpoints. Instead in preferred embodiments the patient would not continuously wear the vagus nerve stimulator. The patient would instead use vagus nerve stimulator only when imminent AF was forecasted during continuous monitoring of the patient s physiological signals by the controller. After the controller sounds the alarm the patient or a caregiver would then apply the vagus nerve stimulator to the patient s neck using stimulation parameters that had already been selected by tuning the controller as described above. The stimulation would then be maintained until the controller no longer forecasts imminent AF or until the physiological indices were within acceptable limits or until a predetermined session duration has elapsed.

A different strategy for selecting the stimulator s parameters may also be used in which several alternate sets of stimulator values are available for use. This strategy would be used when properties of the patient s normal P wave heart rate variability and atrial premature beat frequency indices are not stationary. For example the normal index values may at one time have certain normal semi stationary characteristics but at a later time they may have different semi stationary characteristics for example because of circadian rhythms. In each epoch the controller may be tuned in accordance with the normal P wave morphology heart rate variability and atrial premature beat frequency indices that characterize that epoch. Default stimulation parameter values may be different depending on which semi stationary epoch obtained at the time of controller tuning. Accordingly when the stimulator is eventually used for prophylactic treatment of a patient the stimulator should be set to parameter values that are selected to correspond to the semi stationary epoch that obtains immediately before stimulation is used for the prophylactic therapy.

The vagus nerve is not the only nerve or tissue that may be stimulated as a countermeasure against sympathetic parasympathetic imbalance that may contribute to the onset or persistence of atrial fibrillation see . Commonly assigned co pending patent applications US20070106338 entitled Direct and Indirect Control of Muscle for the Treatment of Pathologies to ERRICO and US20100249873 entitled Direct and Indirect Control of Muscle for the Treatment of Pathologies to ERRICO contemplate the electrical stimulation of nerves emanating from a patient s sympathetic nerve chain as well as stimulation of the nerve plexus of fibers emanating from both the sympathetic nerve chain and the vagus nerve such as the hepatic plexus. U.S. Pat. No. 7 418 292 to SHAFER also relates to electrical stimulation of neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. U.S. Pat. No. 7 877 146 entitled Methods of treating medical conditions by neuromodulation of the sympathetic nervous system to REZAI et al is concerned with the neuromodulation of the sympathetic nervous system to treat a long list of diseases. The stimulation of a branch of the greater splanchnic nerve also causes release of catecholamines from the adrenal gland in addition to direct electrical stimulation of that gland Xi GUO and Arun R. Wakade. Differential secretion of catecholamines in response to peptidergic and cholinergic transmitters in rat adrenals. Journal of Physiology 475 3 1994 539 545 . Therefore devices and methods of the present invention might be applied to other nerves and tissues to treat or avert atrial fibrillation particularly if stimulation of such a non vagus nerve lies reasonably close to the surface of the skin for example as evidenced by the fact that it had previously been stimulated by percutaneous methods.

Although the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
