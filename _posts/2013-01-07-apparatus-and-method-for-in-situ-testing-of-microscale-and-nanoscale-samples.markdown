This invention was made with Government assistance under Grant No. CMMI 07 28189 awarded by National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

As part of applications such as micro electronic and micro electromechanical systems MEMS nano electromechanical systems NEMS and bio MEMS microscale and nanoscale materials exhibit mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms that are different from their bulk counterparts. Accurately predicting material response requires understanding fundamental mechanisms of material deformation and fracture occurrence in microscale and nanoscale. Material properties typically cannot be extrapolated from their respective bulk values since material behavior often is not only different in microscale and nanoscale but is also significantly affected by microstructure sample size and or fabrication processes and further is very sensitive to the influences of interfaces and adjoining materials. Changes in grain size and sample texture can lead to different responses even for the same materials. Some deformation mechanisms that are unimportant at bulk scale can become dominant as the sample s volume decreases and the relative surface area increases such as in thin films. Samples made by gas deposition may exhibit different characteristics from those obtained by chemical clustering. Samples fabricated by mechanical attrition of metal powders may behave differently than those segmented from bulk materials.

Experiments to determine mechanical behavior and deformation mechanisms at macroscale have been largely successful. Yet as the need for using smaller scale materials has increased such as with the development of microelectronics and micro sensors it has become increasingly important to assess the mechanisms of deformation and failure of materials at microscale and nanoscale. However due to the limited number of available testing techniques for microscale and nanoscale samples characterizing materials at these small scales has been a challenge and much effort has been put into developing apparatus and methods for testing.

In general the tension test is the most extensively developed and widely used test for material behavior and it can be used to determine nearly all aspects of the mechanical behavior of a material. The basic principle of the tension test is quite simple but numerous variables affect results. General sources of variation in mechanical test results include factors such as shape of the specimen being tested method of gripping the specimen method of applying the force speed of elongation etc. Also the extent of deformation in tension testing is limited by necking.

Compression tests are alternative approaches that overcome the necking limitation. Compression tests can provide useful information on plastic deformation and failure but certain precautions must be taken to assure a valid test of material behavior. A buckling mode occurs when the length to diameter L D ratio of the test specimen is large. In addition even slightly eccentric loading on nonparallel compression plates will lead to shear distortion. Therefore small L D ratios are normally desired to avoid buckling and provide accurate measurements of the deformation behavior of materials in compression. Friction is another source of anomalous deformation in compression testing of ductile materials.

At macroscale uniaxial tension and compression tests are accomplished by gripping opposite ends of a test item within the load frame of a test instrument and producing tension in the specimen along a single axis while measuring the specimen s response. When properly conducted such tests provide force deformation relations that can quantify several important mechanical properties of a material such as 1 elastic deformation properties Young s modulus and Poisson s ratio 2 yield strength and ultimate tensile strength 3 ductility properties and 4 strain hardening characteristics. Consideration of these material characteristics is important for reliable and optimized design.

In situ uniaxial tests such as in scanning electron microscope SEM or transmission electron microscope TEM chambers can potentially be used to allow direct observation of the deformation mechanism for quantitative and qualitative analysis. In the microscale or nanoscale however certain challenges arise when loading specimens. Examples include gripping of the specimen aligning of the specimen in the direction of the force to minimize likelihood of invalidation of the test caused by flexural stress on the specimen and resultant premature failure and generating small forces e.g. on the order of micro Newtons with high resolutions.

Some of these challenges can be addressed by using a substrate layer that is usually very compliant and with known material properties along with the actual specimen to be tested. However introduction of the substrate complicates the experimental analysis because the microscale material properties of the substrate itself may not be known accurately and because the interface with the substrate may influence the mechanical behavior of the specimen.

For example a prior method of fabricating freestanding aluminum films includes evaporating metal film on a glass slide covered with a water soluble layer releasing the thin film from the glass slide by immersing it in water and gluing the film to grips of a nano tensilometer with epoxy. However problems of mounting the specimen and premature specimen failure invalidate a significant number of tests using this method and experimental results from the tests have shown significant variation in measured elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength.

Another prior fabrication technique includes sputtering metal film on glass slides and releasing the films by peeling the films off from a substrate. A motor driven micrometer is used to produce elongation in the films and a load cell is used to read the stress. Laser spots diffracted from the gratings on the specimen surface determine the strain with 0.002 resolution.

Yet another known method provides a piezoactuated tensile testing apparatus using Ti Cu Ti multilayer films with a length of 700 m a width of 200 m and a total thickness of 1.2 m. The films are patterned on wafers by lithography and are then released from the substrate by wet etching of the substrate. Such a tensile testing apparatus has been known to provide force and displacement resolutions of about 200 N and 20 nm respectively. Still another testing method uses piezoelectric actuators for displacement with a load cell a laser interferometer and a strain gauge optical encoder assembly to measure force and displacement.

A more recent material testing method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 817 255 issued Nov. 16 2004 the 255 patent to Haque and Saif which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. The 255 patent discloses an apparatus and method for uniaxial tensile testing of a thin film material. This apparatus allows quantitative study of thin metal films down to very small thicknesses. The compact size and displacement based measurement of example devices in the 255 patent allows one to conduct in situ quantitative and qualitative tensile testing in environments such as a TEM and an SEM.

An example apparatus disclosed in the 255 patent includes a testing stage e.g. a compact MEMS based chip that includes a co fabricated thin film specimen to be tested held by at least one force sensor beam at a first longitudinal end and by a support structure at a second longitudinal end. An example support structure includes a longitudinal beam connected to the second longitudinal end and aligned with the tensile axis of the specimen and a plurality of lateral support beams. The support beams reduce flexing of the specimen resulting from misalignment of the pulling direction with the tensile axis of the specimen. Preferred embodiments of the chip include a pair of structural springs fabricated for maintaining structural integrity between the first and second ends of the chip and for addressing misalignment. Markers e.g. displacement gauges may be provided for measuring displacement of longitudinal ends of the specimen and deflection of the force sensor beam.

To test the thin film sample specimen the ends of the stage are separated e.g. pulled from one another by an actuator such as a piezoactuator in SEM or a motor in TEM which provides a tensile load on the sample. Measured displacement is used to determine material properties of the thin film specimen. For example the force on the sample is determined from the displacement and the spring constant of the force sensor beams s . The spring constant may be determined mathematically given dimensions and properties of the force sensor beams and or by calibration such as by using a nanoindenter. Sample stretching may be measured for instance by measuring displacement of the force sensor beams and the support structure.

Another testing stage for testing thin film samples is disclosed in Han J. and Saif M.T.A. In Situ microtensile stage for electromechanical characterization of nanoscale freestanding films Review of Scientific Instruments Vol. 77 No. 4 pp. 45102 1 8 2006 Han and Saif which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. An example embodiment disclosed in Han and Saif uses a testing stage co fabricated with a thin film specimen as with the 255 patent. The specimen is disposed between a support structure with a longitudinal beam axially aligned with a tensile axis and a plurality of lateral beams at one end and by one or more deformable lateral force sensor beams with a bisecting longitudinal beam at the opposite end. To protect the metal thin film sample from possible premature failure during fabrication of the testing stage a protecting beam is provided. The protecting beam extends parallel to the co fabricated sample and connects the support structure to the longitudinal beam bisecting the force sensor beams.

After fabricating the sample the protecting beam is cut using focused ion beam FIB to provide a displacement gauge. A laterally extending beam disposed between the support structure and the force sensor beams provides a reference displacement gauge. Tensile testing is performed similarly to that described in the 255 patent. The displacement gauges measure displacement of the sample and the force sensor beams and they are sufficiently near the sample to allow simultaneous observation of the sample stress strain and the displacement gauges in an observation chamber.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 897 927 to Han et al. filed Aug. 31 2007 incorporated in its entirety herein by reference discloses methods and apparatus for testing a microscale or nanoscale sample using an assembly approach which allows a sample to be fabricated independently of the testing stage. A testing stage comprises a frame having first and second laterally opposing ends first and second side beams and first and second longitudinal beams. Each of a pair of slots disposed at each of the free ends of the first and second longitudinal beams comprises a tapered portion leading to a generally longitudinal portion. The slots provide a seat for a dogbone shaped sample.

According to another embodiment of the present invention a microscale testing stage comprises a frame having first and second opposing ends and first and second side beams. At least one deformable force sensor beam near the first end extends laterally across the frame between the first and second side beams. A first longitudinal beam bisects the at least one force sensor beam and has a free end and a second longitudinal beam has a free end facing the free end of the first longitudinal beam to define a gap therebetween. A support structure is disposed near the second end. A pair of slots are disposed at each of the free ends of the first and second longitudinal beams respectively and each of the slots provide a seat for an end of a separately fabricated microscale or nanoscale specimen. A conductive layer of a conductive material is disposed on or in the stage and defines a first conductive path through at least a portion of the stage from a first contact on the stage to one of the slots and a second conductive path through at least another portion of the stage from a second contact on the stage to the other of the slots. The conductive layer defines an open circuit when the gap is open and the specimen closes the circuit across the gap when placed into the pair of slots.

According to still another embodiment of the present invention a high temperature microscale testing stage for a microscale or nanoscale specimen comprises a frame having first and second opposing ends and first and second side beams. At least one deformable force sensor beam near the first end extends laterally across the frame between the first and second side beams. A first longitudinal beam bisects said at least one force sensor beam and has a free end and a second longitudinal beam has a free end facing the free end of the first longitudinal beam to define a gap therebetween. A support structure is disposed near the second end and a pair of slots is disposed at each of the free ends of the first and second longitudinal beams respectively where each of the slots provide a seat for an end of a separately fabricated microscale or nanoscale specimen. The stage is formed of a material having a high melting temperature. In particular example embodiments a temperature sensor is provided.

Embodiments of the present invention provide among other things microscale testing stages and specimens for reducing misalignment during loading of a microscale or nanoscale specimen as a result of uniaxial testing. Example testing stages and specimens can be used in situ for instance in testing environments such as but not limited to TEM and SEM. An example embodiment for uniaxial testing includes a testing stage and a separately fabricated microscale or nanoscale specimen. As used herein it is to be understood that except where indicated otherwise descriptions related to microscale are also generally applicable to nanoscale and vice versa.

An example testing stage includes a frame having first and second opposing ends and first and second side beams at least one deformable force sensor beam near the first opposing end extending laterally across the frame between the first and second side beams a first longitudinal beam bisecting the at least one force sensor beam and having a free end and a second longitudinal beam having a free end facing the free end of the first longitudinal beam to define a gap therebetween. A support structure is disposed near the second opposing end and comprises a plurality of laterally extending beams the second longitudinal beam bisecting the plurality of laterally extending beams. A pair of slots is disposed at each of the free ends of the first and second longitudinal beams respectively each of the slots providing a seat for an end of the specimen. A conductive layer or layers is provided on the testing stage to define conductive paths through at least a portion of the testing stage from each of first and second contacts on the testing stage to each of the slots respectively. An open circuit is defined across the stage which can be closed by the specimen when placed into the pair of slots.

The terminals may be coupled to any of various electrical devices for electrical measurement of the specimen and or supplying current or voltage to the specimen. For example such stages can allow concurrent measurement of mechanical and electrical properties to explore their coupled interactions. Stress strain response fracture strength and piezoresistance are of great interest with MEMS and NEMS applications. An example stage is capable of measuring these properties independently and simultaneously in SEM and TEM under uniaxial loading. Example embodiments for mechano electrical testing can also include a specimen having a self aligning mechanism.

Other embodiments of the present invention provide an in situ uniaxial testing stage comprising a material having a high melting temperature which allows the stage to test microscale or nanoscale samples by measuring simultaneous forces at high temperatures. An example stage is of a unitary material having a high melting temperature. The stage includes a frame having first and second opposing ends and first and second side beams at least one deformable force sensor beam near the first opposing end extending laterally across the frame between the first and second side beams a first longitudinal beam bisecting the at least one force sensor beam and having a free end and a second longitudinal beam having a free end facing the free end of the first longitudinal beam to define a gap therebetween. A support structure is disposed near the second opposing end and comprises a plurality of laterally extending beams such that the second longitudinal beam bisects the plurality of laterally extending beams. A pair of slots is disposed at each of the free ends of the first and second longitudinal beams respectively each of the slots providing a seat for an end of a separately fabricated specimen. Example stages can also be used for mechano electrical measurements either through the unitary material itself or an additionally layered material and or for providing Joule heating through a resistive path provided by the stage. In particular example embodiments a bi metal temperature sensor can be provided as part of the stage for measuring the temperature of the stage.

An example MEMS or NEMS based uniaxial stage is capable of testing a wide range of material and accommodating various specimen dimensions with uniaxial tension and compression loading. Example embodiments allow testing of any of various types of materials including organic inorganic or a combination of materials. Sample materials include but are not limited to metals including single crystal or polycrystal dielectrics biological materials and or multi layer composites that can be fabricated into a suitable shape to be used with the particular testing stage. Embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for probing microscale or nanoscale material behavior where the deformation characteristics are expected to deviate significantly from bulk values. Because the samples are fabricated separately a greater variety of samples are possible for material testing than that available under certain previous methods. Further separately fabricated samples allow particular example testing stages to be reusable.

Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that are not to scale which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.

During testing the first end is moved relative to the second end for instance using a moving stage not shown having pillars coupled to the testing stage at apertures such as pinholes . For tensile testing the first end and the second end are moved away from one another along a loading direction L while for compressive testing the first end and the second end are moved toward one another along the loading direction the direction of the arrow L in is for tensile testing . Either the first end or the second end may be a fixed end while the other end is moved. Alternatively both ends may be moved while loading.

For supporting a specimen sample to be tested the testing stage includes a first longitudinal beam that is substantially laterally centered within the frame and coaxial with the loading direction L. The first longitudinal beam bisects one or more and preferably several deformable force sensor beams . These force sensor beams extend laterally between the first and second side beams . As shown in the force sensor beams extend along a lateral line such as line A A. The force sensor beams provide support to the first longitudinal beam and are configured to deflect in response to a tensile or compressive stress on the sample. Using a plurality of force sensor beams in the testing stage allows a larger range of spring constants when testing the sample. For example if the sample to be used is soft one or more of the force sensor beams may be cut such as by focused ion beam FIB to lower the beam stiffness and attain higher force resolution.

The example testing stage also includes a second laterally centered longitudinal beam also coaxial with the loading direction L which bisects a plurality of laterally extending beams . These generally rectangular beams which extend laterally between the first and second side beams such as along line B B in provide a support structure for supporting the second longitudinal beam and help to reduce misalignment during loading. While three support beams are shown in it will be appreciated that less than or more than three support beams are possible. Thus the support structure is not intended to be limited to the configuration shown. It is preferred however that a plurality of the support beams be used.

As also shown in the first and second longitudinal beams are coaxially disposed so that free ends of the beams face one another the edges of which are separated by a gap . These free ends include generally symmetrical sample slots which support ends of a separately fabricated sample and provide sample grips. Thus slots such as the slots are also referred to herein as grips. For testing the sample is placed within the testing stage such as by using a focused ion beam FIB omniprobe so that first and second ends of the sample are seated within the sample slots at the free ends . The sample is partially suspended spanning the gap between the first and second longitudinal beams to connect the beams. A nonlimiting example length for the sample is between one half micron and twenty microns.

The sample shown in is formed into a dogbone shape and the sample slots in the free ends can be similarly patterned in complementary parts to receive the sample. Other example shapes for the slots are shown and described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 897 927 filed Aug. 31 2007. The sample generally includes a pair of enlarged longitudinally opposed ends having at least a portion tapered inwardly to a more narrow longitudinal portion extending therebetween. Similarly the sample slots may each include a laterally enlarged portion that tapers inwardly to a narrower longitudinal portion . The longitudinal portions of the sample slots are coaxial with the loading direction. The sample slots can be formed by patterning and Si etching FIB and or other methods. A nonlimiting example material for the sample is single crystal silicon with a crystal orientation .

The support structure supporting the second longitudinal beam transmits the displacement between the first and second ends of the testing stage to the sample during testing via the second longitudinal beam. The support beams also correct load misalignment between the loading direction and the load axis of the load axis of the sample . Similarly the force sensor beams indicate a force transmitted to the sample via the first longitudinal beam . Both the support beams and the force sensor beams preferably are compliant in the in plane transverse direction but stiff in other directions due to high depth to width ratio e.g. 150 10 150 60 .

For preventing premature loading of the sample within the testing stage the second longitudinal beam preferably terminates beyond the support structure in a cantilevered support end opposite the free end . The support end extends laterally from the center of the second longitudinal beam forming a symmetrical generally T shaped end . An opening is formed in the second end to accommodate the support end and this opening is slightly larger than the T shaped support end to provide a pair of small gaps on longitudinally opposed sides of the cantilevered end. During testing tensile loading and compressive loading the testing stage has to be pulled or pushed respectively to close one of the gaps before imparting a load on the sample .

To further correct misalignment between the sample and the loading direction and for providing additional structural integrity to the testing stage a pair of springs such as U shaped springs is provided at each lateral side respectively near the side beams or elsewhere on the testing stage. These springs deform when the first end and the second end are pulled apart during relative movement e.g. during actuation of the testing stage and thus substantially prevent the side beams between the springs and the first end from deforming. This also facilitates transmission of the displacement between the ends along the second longitudinal beam to the sample . Cutouts not shown may be provided within the side beams for providing additional structural integrity.

The inward edges at the facing front ends of the first and second longitudinal beams can provide displacement gauges for measuring stress of the force sensor beams and displacement of the ends of the sample . As shown in a center gauge is provided by a beam that extends laterally from the side beam toward the edges functioning as a reference. Cutouts not shown at the inward edges may be provided to further define the displacement gauges e.g. to provide a larger range of measurement without interfering with the sample .

It will be appreciated that additional or alternative displacement gauges or markers may be provided on the testing stage or the sample at different locations to measure the displacement in the sample and the force on the sample. Locating displacement gauges or markers near the sample though allows the gauges or markers to be read simultaneously with observation of the sample. This may be especially useful during in situ monitoring and testing such as within a TEM or SEM chamber to enable simultaneous study of the sample s quantitative response as well as its microstructural and topological evolution during deformation.

Upon loading the support springs transfer the deformation to the specimen . In an example testing stage the U beams suppress misalignment between the pillar and the grips by six orders of magnitude e.g. 18 loading alignment error can be reduced to 1.33 10degrees misalignment at the grips . The specimen and the force sensor beams are in series. Therefore the load in the specimen is obtained from the deformation of the beams where the stiffness of the beams is calibrated by a scale. A desired high resolution of the force sensor beams can also be achieved by decreasing the width of the force sensor beams. In an example operation after the calibration of the force sensor beams the tensile stage and the specimens are assembled for instance in an FIB e.g. an FEI Dual Beam 235 FIB chamber for assembly using the FIB omniprobe. The specimen may be fixed to the probe e.g. by Pt deposition and after assembly the specimen may be released from the probe e.g. by FIB milling .

To apply load on the sample the testing stage is actuated so that the appropriate gap at the opening becomes closed for tensile or compressive testing. Further actuation applies load on the sample and the displacement gauges and or markers are moved relative to one another to provide deflection of the force sensor beams which can be used to calculate the force on the sample by multiplying with the stiffness of the force sensor beams. The relative movement of the displacement gauges and or markers also provides the deformation and thus the strain of the sample . The strain response of the specimen is correlated with the applied stress.

In a particular nonlimiting example operation for tensile testing scanning electron microscope SEM images are taken to measure strain and stress of the specimen simultaneously. A correlation algorithm is used to track arbitrary marks automatically with resolution enhancement up to 1 10 of pixel size. Image tracking marks in an example embodiment are created on the stage and the specimen by FIB milling. The marks on the stage may be located for instance on one or both of the grips and on the force sensing gauge . For the specimen several marks can be created along the vertical surface for instance near top bottom and neutral planes of the specimen. These marks allow for independent measurement of the strain corresponding to the different planes away from the neutral plane and the systematic investigation of non uniform loading during the test. Again though tensile testing is described in this example stages such as the testing stage are preferably capable of both tension and compression tests.

In an example method for calibrating the force sensor beams the effect of geometric nonlinearity of the force sensor beams is considered. This effect is due to the beam s transverse deformation along the loading direction L. The force sensor beams are anchored to the frame at their ends and therefore the beams not only bend but also stretch during large deformation. Thus a force displacement relation becomes where is a linear spring constant and is a nonlinear spring constant. The linear and nonlinear spring constants of N pairs of the force sensor beams e.g. at A A in can be written as

As stated above alignment is a significant consideration for accuracy of uniaxial testing stages. For example misalignment between the axis of loading and the sample axis results in non uniform stress on the cross section of the sample as well as along its gauge length. The degree of misalignment may change in a given experiment with increasing load due to the shift of the location of the load at the grip. This shift is due to compliance of the sample and or the loading stage resulting in a nonlinear relation between the measured applied load and strain at a point on the surface of the sample even though the strains are small and the materials are linear elastic.

In the case of ideal alignment the neutral axes of the grips are precisely aligned with a neutral axis of the testing frame . Moreover these aligned components are in line with the specimen neutral axis such as along a centerline of the longitudinal portion . Misalignment in uniaxial tests in general is caused by a combination of poor alignment of grips transverse misalignment TM poor conformance of specimen and grips rotational misalignment RM and inaccurate machining of the test specimen itself misalignment due to shape of tested materials MS . A combination of these three sources of misalignment which occur simultaneously operates in uniaxial tests. The main influence of this combined misalignment is stress and strain gradients across a specimen where the extreme stresses and strains occur at the surfaces. Validity of testing results can be affected by these gradients.

It is particularly difficult to achieve uniaxial loading in small scale. Unlike macroscale uniaxial testing instruments it can be challenging to utilize alignment devices achieve precise alignment between grips and a specimen and fabricate an exact specimen shape for microscale or nanoscale testing due to the small size that is required.

In the example testing stage RM can be made very small due to the provided U shaped springs in combination with an accurate alignment between the grips . To help minimize TM a tensile stage is shown in according to another embodiment of the present invention. The testing stage is generally similar to the testing stage shown in and like parts are indicated with like reference characters. However to reduce TM grips are provided that have a depth to about mid height of the stage which depth may also be adjusted to accommodate the thickness of the sample as shown in . This suppresses the effect of the compliance of the stage as otherwise asymmetry of the sample location with respect to mid height of the stage results in bending of the stage. In the example testing stage having a stage height of 150 m and a sample thickness of about 30 m the example grips have a depth of 90 m 15 m deeper than 75 m to compensate for the sample thickness .

To enhance the resolution of the force measurement force sensing beams are provided having a reduced beam width as shown in . In the example testing stage the width of the force beams is reduced from 60 m to 12 m and accordingly the resolution of the force measurement is enhanced by two orders of magnitude. These thinner force sensing beams lead to large transverse deformation and thus the nonlinear spring constant is properly considered.

Also as shown in a specimen is provided having the general dogbone shape of the specimen but further includes freestanding arms having a portion extending parallel to a gauge length that provide a strain measurement gauge for strain resolution enhancement. As best seen in the arms include top and bottom image tracking marks which in combination with tracking marks formed on the stage and tracking marks formed on the center gauge provide automated stress strain measurement with resolution enhancement. The strain measurement gauge ensures that the gauge length of the specimen is free from any influence of FIB ion milling or an electron beam e.g. in the SEM.

To further minimize non uniform loading from grips a specimen is provided according to additional embodiments of the present invention that includes a self aligning mechanism between grips and the gauge length of the specimen. The self aligning mechanism prevents bending from being transferred to the specimen thus providing a reliable method to test mechanical properties of microscale and nanoscale specimens with uniaxial loading. Finite element analysis shows a significant reduction of the non uniform stress in example specimens. Tensile testing of example single crystal silicon specimens gives an expected elastic modulus.

FIGS. and A B show a specimen according to an example embodiment. The preferably unitary material specimen includes a centrally disposed gauge length portion and outer portions providing gripped parts. The outer portions may be made similarly to the samples or may have other configurations. To provide a self aligning mechanism a pair of self aligning beams is provided on both longitudinally opposed sides of the gauge length portion . An inner pair of self aligning beams is disposed respectively between the gauge length portion and the outer portions at either end separated from the gauge length portion by a transition portion . An outer pair of self aligning beams is disposed between the inner self aligning beams and the outer portions separated from the inner self aligning beams by a transition portion . Each of the aligning beams are flexible in designed bending directions such that they behave as hinges connected to the gauge length portion . This leads to significant reduction in bending and improves validity of testing results.

In the example specimen cross sectional areas of the aligning beams are larger than that of the tested part the gauge length portion so that the mean stress in the self aligning beams is always smaller than that in the gauge length portion. Additionally the bending stiffness of the self aligning beams is much smaller than that of the gauge length portion so that any bending due to misalignment from grips can be suppressed by the self aligning beams.

These example features will now be described more particularly with respect to . The specimen generally includes the gripped parts GP the gauge length portion of the specimen inner self aligning beams each of which are referred to in the equations that follow as self aligning beam I and outer self aligning beams each of which are referred to as self aligning beam II separated by transition portions . Note that despite the use of I and II the locations of the beams and their respective directions can be reversed in other embodiments. The dimensions of respective parts can be defined by W Hand L where i 1 2 and 3 correspond to the gauge length portion self aligning beam I and self aligning beam II respectively. The difference in cross sectional areas described above indicates that WH

The other general feature described above is that the bending stiffness of the self aligning beams is much smaller than that of the gauge length portion about a designed direction. For instance self aligning beam I and self aligning beam II preferably are configured to be compliant in an out of plane bending direction and an in plane bending direction respectively though again these directions can be reversed . Hence the bending stiffness ratios between the specimen gauge length and the self aligning beam I are

To predict the response of the self aligning specimen analytically upon loading the system is simplified by one dimensional beams due to the high ratio of length to height e.g. 50 . shows a schematic for a first case Case I with a hinge like self aligning mechanism according to an embodiment of the present invention. shows a schematic for a second case Case II without a hinge like mechanism. L and I are length and moment of inertia respectively. The beams shown have pinned pinned boundary conditions.

Example self aligning specimens are fabricated by microfabrication and FIB milling. An example fabricated sample is shown in . The inner and outer self aligning beams are modified by FIB milling during which the gauge length tested material is preferably never directly exposed to ion beam. Measurement arms are provided on the specimen including a portion extending parallel to the gauge length . The example measurement arms are supported by the transition portion .

An example gauge length portion is 50 m long with A 5 m 18 and a self aligning sample is used with I I I 1.5 shown in where Iand Iare moment of inertia for the beam hinge and the gauge length portion see . The length of beam is about 160 m. The stress strain relation and versus curve are shown in respectively. The apparent elastic moduli of the specimen are E 180 GPa and E 160 GPa. Eis 170 GPa with 0.6 relative error with respect to E. The strain ratio 1.1 is obtained by linear fit. Error in the measured elastic modulus on the top of the sample is e 6.1 and at the bottom of the sample is 5.6 . The difference in the magnitude of eat the top and at the bottom of the sample is further reduced.

Next the same sample is used but with increased I I I 23 . The curve is shown in . As expected the stress uniformity in the sample is further improved for large I since 1.02.

Thus specimens according to example embodiments having self aligning hinges can significantly reduce non uniform stress. By providing multiple hinges such as hinges the influence of unaccounted misalignment errors is eliminated or minimized even when the misalignments at the grips induce in and out of plane bending. Thus the example hinges allow almost ideal uniaxial loading for microscale or nanoscale uniaxial tests. Accordingly even when single strain measurement either at the top or bottom of the sample is available the elastic modulus can be measured accurately.

Application of strain to a crystal leads to a change in electrical conductivity due to the piezoresistance effect. Piezoresistance effect has been extensively studied and used for mechanical sensors with high sensitivity and good linearity. More recently the drive for miniaturization of such sensors has resulted in increased attention to the material properties at macro nano scale. Due to the size dependence of material properties their bulk properties cannot be extrapolated to small scale directly. Further observed superplasticity of well known brittle materials for instance suggests that large strain should be imposed to small samples for complete mechano electrical characterization.

Hence independent and simultaneous in situ measurement of resistance for a small scale sample along with stress strain response is essential for characterization of mechano electrical properties and deformation mechanism of materials. However characterization of mechano electrical properties for small volume samples involves several challenges including sample preparation and manipulation measuring force and displacement with high resolution and electrical connection to the sample and reliable resistance measurement. Thus MEMS based apparatuses and methods are provided which allow concurrent in situ measurement of mechanical and electrical properties to explore their coupled interactions up to sample fracture strength.

According to another embodiment of the present invention a micro apparatus e.g. MEMS based apparatus is provided that allows mechano electrical testing of nanoscale or microscale samples in situ e.g. in SEM and TEM. In example tests using such an apparatus in situ observation of samples at high resolution can reveal fundamental mechanism of deformation of materials and their size dependence at small scale. Example embodiments of the present invention allow concurrent measurement of mechanical and electrical properties to explore their coupled interactions. The sample specimen to be tested can be fabricated separately from the testing stage. Hence samples from a wide range of materials and sizes can be tested. Example testing stages may be employed for instance to measure stress strain response fracture strength and or electrical resistivity as a function of strain of single crystal silicon or other materials with sample dimensions from 10down to 10 m. The known elastic modulus can be recovered as well as piezoresistive properties of SCS with high e.g. 99.99 accuracy.

As with the stage the first end and the second end can be coupled to a moving stage for instance via pillars of a piezoelectric actuator labeled in as C and E coupled at apertures such as pinholes . For tensile testing the first end and the second end are moved away from one another along a loading direction while for compressive testing the first end and the second end are moved toward one another along the loading direction the direction of the arrow in is for tensile testing . Either the first end or the second end may be a fixed end while the other end is moved. Alternatively both ends may be moved while loading.

For supporting a specimen such as the specimens a first longitudinal beam is substantially laterally centered within the frame and has a central axis coaxial with the loading direction. Similar to testing stage the first longitudinal beam bisects one or more and preferably several deformable force sensor beams which extend laterally between the first and second side beams . As shown in the force sensor beams extend along a lateral line such as line A A. The example testing stage also includes a second laterally centered longitudinal beam also having a central axis coaxial with the loading direction and bisecting a plurality of laterally extending generally rectangular beams such as along line B B in . The beams provide a support structure for supporting the second longitudinal beam and for reducing misalignment during loading. As with testing stage more than or fewer than the three support beams shown in are also contemplated and the support structure is not intended to be limited to the configuration shown. To correct misalignment between the sample and the loading direction and for providing additional structural integrity to the testing stage springs such as U shaped springs are provided at each lateral side respectively near the side beams or elsewhere on the testing stage.

As shown in and the first and second longitudinal beams are coaxially disposed so that free ends of the beams face one another the edges of which are separated by a gap labeled D in . As with the testing stage these free ends include generally symmetrical sample slots which support ends of the separately fabricated sample in a specimen similar to specimen is shown by example and provide sample grips. The grips allow an assembly approach so that samples from a wide range of materials can be fabricated separately from the stage and tested. The sample may be placed within the testing stage as with other methods described herein.

In an example operation the specimen fits into the grips and the specimen is loaded by deforming the stage using a piezoelectric actuator with the two metal pillars C and E . Force on the specimen is obtained from the deformation of the force sensor beams where stiffness of these beams can be calibrated by scale Upon loading the deformation of the force sensor beams and the strain of the sample can he obtained from image analysis.

Following fabrication of the Si stage a thin layer of SiO is grown on all the surfaces . A thin preferably ductile layer of a conductive material such as but not limited to gold is then deposited e.g. by sputtering which coats both horizontal and vertical surfaces of the stage . The two ends of the stage are then electrically isolated from one another by removing part of the conductive material from the mid region see line F F in of the stage by FIB as shown in .

Thus as shown in the electrically conductive layer provides a first conductive path between a contact on the stage as a nonlimiting example where the conductive layer contacts the left as shown metal pillar and the grip . Similarly a second conductive path is provided between a contact on the stage where the conductive layer contacts the right as shown by nonlimiting example metal pillar and the grip . The open mid region creates an open circuit across the stage so that the ends and both of the metal pillars are electrically isolated from one another unless the specimen is placed in the grips to close the circuit. In a nonlimiting example method the specimen is placed in the grips by using a micro manipulator. Resistance measurement and other electrical or electromechanical measurement of the specimen can be performed by forming the closed circuit through the two metal pillars. Though contacts are shown in to electrical contact pillars it is also contemplated that other locations along the conductive layer can provide contacts and may be electrically coupled to other electrical devices so long as the contacts are electrically isolated from one another before the circuit is closed by the specimen or so long as the circuit is otherwise suitably configured for measurement by the specimen closing the gap . It is also contemplated that same or separate devices may he used to mechanically manipulate the stage and to provide electrical measurement for the specimen .

In an example operation using the testing stage mechano electrical properties of small scale single crystal silicon SCS samples one of the most commonly used piezoresistive materials are characterized by forming a circuit such as a circuit shown in . The testing stage offers concurrent and direct in situ measurement of mechanical and electrical measurement of small volume specimens. With uniaxial tensile loading up to fracture of samples stress strain response fracture strength and piezoresistance can be independently and simultaneously measured. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the example methods described herein can be readily extended to various materials and sizes due to the assembly approach.

In order to achieve desired uniform strain the U beam springs and the ductile gold film are used to suppress misalignment between the pillars and the grips and between the grips and the sample respectively. The uniform strain. was confirmed by the equality of strain at the top and bottom of the specimen as shown in .

Contact resistance between the metal pillars and the testing stage was measured before the FIB cut at mid region and it was consistently less than 50 for all tested apparatuses. This contact resistance is ignored for all resistance measurement in the example testing operations due to the relatively large resistance of the tested samples. This assumption induces only about 0.01 measurement error which is compatible with instrument error. Electrical isolation between the two ends was confirmed by comparing resistances of the stage before and after the FIB cut and the ratio between the two cases was less than 10. An example resistance measurement of the specimen is performed by using the circuit shown in . In the circuit a voltage reference V a precision resistor R and an impedance for a microvolt meter MVM R are precisely known. The total resistance for the measurement instrument indicated by the dotted line in is

The single crystal silicon specimens were separately fabricated by ICP DRIE and characterized. Stress strain response fracture strength and piezoresistance were independently and simultaneously measured. shows the stress strain response of two SCS samples with cross sectional areas of 72 mand 2.5 m. The elastic modulus of both the samples is 173 GPa close to the expected value of 169 GPa for SCS along direction. Two samples show substantial difference in the fracture strain 2.07 and 3.18 for the larger and the smaller samples respectively.

Other embodiments of the present invention provide among other things in situ uniaxial testing apparatus in scanning and transmission electron microscopy SEM and TEM at high temperature for microscale and nanoscale samples. While methods have been provided to test some small volume materials at room temperature microscale and nanoscale devices are often required to operate in a wide range of temperature such as but not limited to sensors used in automobiles planes and aerospace. Hence it is very useful to test and understand material properties of such materials at in service temperature including in high temperature environments.

To provide uniaxial testing of nanoscale to microscale samples at high temperature as a nonlimiting example at or above about 1000 C. a high temperature testing stage is provided according to another embodiment of the present invention. An example silicon carbide SiC based MEMS testing stage is shown in . Silicon carbide is chosen as an example material for the example testing stage due to its outstanding mechanical properties at high temperature semiconductive characteristics and high heat conductive coefficient. For example SiC has high melting temperature 2730 C. and shows small variation in elastic modulus within 4 between at 1000 C. with respect to room temperature . However other materials for high temperature testing stages are also contemplated such as Nichrome platinum or others. Choice of particular material can be at least partially based as a nonlimiting example on mechanical properties of the material at particular target high temperatures. The melting temperature and temperature range for small variation in elastic modulus for particular materials can be selected according to the testing needs such as the particular environment in which a particular sample material will be use. Also while the semiconductive characteristics of SiC are useful for a testing stage such as stage it is not required that all high temperature compliant testing stages be made from material having such characteristics.

The testing stage e.g. made entirely from SiC substrate material includes a generally rectangular frame having a first opposing end and a second opposing end . A pair of laterally opposed side beams extend longitudinally between the first opposing end and the second opposing end . The testing stage may be of various dimensions.

As with the stages the first end and the second end can be coupled to a moving stage for instance via pillars of a piezoelectric actuator labeled in as D and F coupled at apertures such as pinholes . For tensile testing the first end and the second end are moved away from one another along a loading direction as with stages while for compressive testing the first end and the second end are moved toward one another along the loading direction. Either the first end or the second end may he a fixed end while the other end is moved. Alternatively both ends may he moved while loading 

For supporting a specimen such as the specimens a first longitudinal beam is substantially laterally centered within the frame and having a central axis coaxial with the loading direction. Similar to testing stages the first longitudinal beam bisects one or more and preferably several deformable force sensor beams which extend laterally between the first and second side beams . As shown in the force sensor beams extend along a lateral line such as line A A. The example testing stage also includes a second laterally centered longitudinal beam also having a central axis coaxial with the loading direction and bisecting a plurality of laterally extending generally rectangular beams such as along line B B in . The beams provide a support structure for supporting the second longitudinal beam and for reducing misalignment during loading. As with testing stages more than or fewer than the three support beams shown in are also contemplated and the support structure is not intended to be limited to the configuration shown. To correct misalignment between the sample and the loading direction and for providing additional structural integrity to the testing stage springs such as U shaped springs are provided at each lateral side respectively near the side beams or elsewhere on the testing stage.

The first and second longitudinal beams are coaxially disposed so that free ends of the beams face one another the edges of which are separated by a gap labeled C in . As with the testing stages these free ends include generally symmetrical sample slots which support ends of the separately fabricated sample and provide sample grips such as those shown in and or . The grips as with those of stages allow an assembly approach so that samples from a wide range of materials can be fabricated separately from the stage and tested. The sample may be placed within the testing stage as with other methods described herein.

The configuration of the example high temperature testing stage and the high temperature material e.g. SiC allow simultaneous force measurement by measuring deformation of the force sensor beams at a raised temperature as a nonlimiting example about 1200 C. . Further because SiC is a semiconductive material the example stage can be resistively heated by applying electric current through contacts D E . SiC also has a high heat conductive coefficient and thus can be transferred to the specimen efficiently.

In an example embodiment the testing stage includes a bi material type temperature sensor for evaluating temperature in situ. As shown in FIGS. and A E the temperature sensor includes a measuring arm which may be directly supported by a substrate such as a portion of the testing stage or a different stage or indirectly supported by a support depending on the particular configuration used. Another arm includes an end generally facing the free end of the measuring arm serving as a gauge or reference and this arm may itself be directly or indirectly supported by the testing stage or a different stage depending on the particular configuration used. In other embodiments the measuring arm the substrate the support and the reference arm may be a single piece which itself is attached to the testing stage or a different stage. Preferably the measuring arm the reference arm and the support are of a unitary material which may be that of the testing stage or of a different material. Further the arms and can extend from a portion of the testing stage or a different stage . In the arms and extend from the longitudinal beams respectively though the arms may extend from other portions of the testing stage in other embodiments or may be part of a unitary piece as discussed above that is attached to the testing stage or a different stage at any of various locations.

The measuring arm includes an additional layer of a material having a different thermal expansion coefficient than that of the principal layer of the measuring arm thus providing a bi material temperature sensor. As shown in the example of the measuring arm as well as the arm is made of silicon while the additional layer is platinum. In another nonlimiting example embodiment the materials are SiC and platinum respectively. Si Pt may be useful for instance at relatively low temperatures e.g. below 600 C. or below brittle to ductile transition temperature for silicon . The measuring arm is thus divided into two lengths a length L along both layered materials and a length l where the measuring arm has one layer of material. A distance can be defined between the free end of the measuring arm and the end of the reference arm . This distance increases with increase in temperature due to the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch. To calibrate the temperature sensor the onset of phase transition for pure metals such as but not limited to Ti Zn Al and Ag with known melting temperatures can be correlated with . General principles of the bi metal temperature sensor can be found in S. Timoshenko Analysis of bi metal thermostats Journal of the Optical Society of America 11 3 233 255 1925 which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

For uniaxial testing the testing stage can be operated as discussed herein with respect to other testing stages. In example methods using the testing stage mechanical characterization can be performed by recovering known elastic modulus of single crystal silicon samples at room temperature. Then the bi material type temperature sensor can be calibrated as described above. show an example operation demonstrating heating capability by using an SiC heating element in air. An Si stage is placed on a piezoactuator and heat radiation is provided by applying electric current through the stage such as through resistive path along the frame between pillars . The temperature is believed to have reached about 1200 C. show the testing stage in a vacuum chamber demonstrating the testing stage operating at glass melting temperature.

The size of the example SiC stage is small enough to localize influence of heat near interested samples without damaging SEM TEM and thus in situ testing of microscale or nanoscale samples in an SEM TEM environment can be performed. Such in situ uniaxial testing allows direct observation of fundamental mechanisms of microscale or nanoscale samples. This capability can provide opportunities not only to study MEMS NEMS related materials with temperature variation but also to explore energy related materials that are used in nuclear reactors and fossil fired plants for instance at high temperature. Efficiency of the nuclear and fossil fired plants is directly related to their operation temperature. For example nuclear reactors generally operate at 330 C. with 34 efficiency while the efficiency will be 50 at 1000 C. This clearly indicates the importance of providing advanced materials for higher temperature applications and a material testing method at in service temperature. By using the example SiC based stage underlying mechanisms in material degradation creep and crack formation processes at high temperature can be directly observed in situ in SEM TEM. This fundamental understanding of material responses at high temperature will provide materials design criteria for desired material properties and reliable life span prediction.

While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described it should be understood that other modifications substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which should be determined from the appended claims.
