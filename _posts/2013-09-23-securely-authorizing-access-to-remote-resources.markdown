Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to application management and more particularly to methods and apparatuses for providing securely authorized access to remote resources.

Managing authorization for software application application usage is critical to ensuring that sensitive resources are protected from unauthorized access. Depending on the sensitivity of any given application an array of authorization rules may be necessary to ensure that the resources are adequately protected. Some applications may only require ensuring that an authorized user is requesting the resource. Other applications may require compliance with more stringent authorization rules such as determining whether the user device executing the application is a secure user device. When dealing with applications that access medical records financial records or other resources that may pertain to an individual and contain confidential and or personal information even more advanced control over application usage may be desired. To date application management solutions have not addressed the unique security concerns for authorizing application access to remote resources.

More particularly a managed user device may include an authorized user device such as a user device communicatively coupled to a management server a user device enrolled into and or registered with a management service a user device associated with a service contract for a management service and or a user device that satisfies at least one compliance rule depicted in associated with a management service .

In any case the resource service may determine if a user device is authorized to communicate with the resource server and or access the contents of the resource store . If the resource service determines that a user device is authorized the resource service may permit the user device to communicate with the resource server and or access the contents of the resource store . If the resource service determines that a user device is not authorized the resource service may prohibit the user device from communicating with the resource server and or accessing the contents of the resource store . The resource server may store any type of data such as various types of general individual specific or enterprise specific content applications records and or any other data in the resource store . Common examples of resources depicted in that may be stored by the resource server in the resource store include documents and or word processor files photos and or graphic files presentations and or slide show files spreadsheets and or other computational files and other electronic files commonly used for business.

For purposes of convenience the resource server is referred to herein in the singular although it will be understood that a plurality of servers may be employed in the arrangements as descried herein. Furthermore in some embodiments multiple resource servers may operate on the same server computer. The components executed on the resource server for example may comprise various applications services processes systems engines or functionality not disclosed in detail herein.

The management server may be any type of network accessible electronic device or system that includes a service such as the depicted management service and a storage such as the depicted management record store management identifier store and compliance rule store . For purposes of convenience the management identifier store is depicted within the management record store as in certain embodiments a management identifier depicted in stored within the management identifier store may be related to and or associated with a management record stored within the management record store . The management server may be configured to communicate with the user device and or the resource server over one or more networks such as the depicted network to provide user device management capabilities. For example the management server may comprise cloud based solutions server computers and or any other system providing user device management capabilities.

In any case the management service may determine whether a user device is authorized to perform certain functionality such as accessing resources stored within a resource store of a resource server based at least in part on at least one management record stored within the management record store at least one management identifier stored within the management identifier store and or at least one compliance rule stored within the compliance rule store . For instance the management service may query the management record store to determine whether a management record is associated with a user device seeking to perform certain functionality which may be required for the user device to be authorized to perform the functionality. The management service may also query the management identifier store to determine whether a management identifier has been issued to the user device which may be alternatively or additionally required for the user device to be authorized to perform the functionality. The management service may also query the compliance rule store to identify at least one compliance rule that must be satisfied by the user device which may be alternatively or additionally required for the user device to be authorized to perform the functionality.

For purposes of convenience the management server is referred to herein in the singular although it will be understood that a plurality of servers may be employed in the arrangements as descried herein. Furthermore in some embodiments multiple management servers may operate on the same server computer. The components executed on the management server for example may comprise various applications services processes systems engines or functionality not disclosed in detail herein. The management service executed by the management server may according to some example embodiments be configured to notify the resource service executed by the resource server that at least one user device is authorized to access resources stored by the resource server within the resource store .

As described herein the management server may comprise a management service and a compliance rule store storing one or more compliance rules e.g. compliance policies that may be applicable to a user device . While the management service is shown as within the management server the management application may additionally or alternately be within the user device s and or remotely located on the resource server and may be remotely updated such as periodically via management server according to any number of suitable over the air OTA updating methods. In some embodiments for instance an agent application executed by the user device may provide functionality equivalent to and or on behalf of the management service .

Attempts by the user device to perform certain functionality such as accessing downloading uploading viewing and or modifying resources may require the user device to be in compliance with one or more of the compliance rules . Depending on the sensitivity and or nature of a given resource different compliance rules may be necessary to ensure that the resource is adequately restricted. Some resources may only require ensuring that the proper user is requesting the functionality such as a user that has been issued a management identifier by the management service . Other resources may require compliance with more stringent authorization rules such as determining whether the resources are restricted during certain time windows or geographic areas. Accordingly the user device and or the management server may be operative to determine whether the user of the user device is authorized to access the resources at the time a user of the user device requests to access such resources .

The management server may for example use the compliance rules to impose hardware restrictions regarding the use of specific user devices and or specific user device features such as for instance cameras Bluetooth IRDA tethering external storage a mobile access point and or other hardware restrictions. The compliance rules may additionally or alternatively impose software restrictions such as the use of specific user device operating systems or applications internet browser restrictions screen capture functionality and or other software restrictions. Mobile device management restrictions may additionally or alternatively be included in the compliance rules and may comprise encryption requirements firmware versions remote lock and wipe functionalities logging and reporting features GPS tracking and or other user device management features.

The management server may determine whether one or more characteristics of a requesting user device satisfy one or more of the restrictions enumerated in the compliance rules . For example the management server may determine that a requesting user device that has a camera Bluetooth capability and is executing a specified version of an operating system satisfies the compliance rules . As another example the management server may determine that a requesting user device that is associated with an external storage unit and screen capture functionality enabled does not satisfy the compliance rules .

In some embodiments an agent application executed by the user device may make the compliance determination based on a device profile Depicted in describing the user device and or user data Depicted in describing a user of the user device which may include user credentials and or user preferences. For instance the agent application may monitor calls by applications on the user device such as the resource access application a productivity application a web browser an email client and or any other application to an operating system of the user device to determine whether the user device seeks to perform functionality associated with one and or more of the compliance rules described above such as viewing modifying transmitting and or receiving resources . Additionally the agent application executed on the user device s may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests. For instance the agent application may instruct the operating system of the user device to prevent the user device from viewing modifying transmitting and or receiving resources in response to a determination that a compliance rule is not satisfied which may be effectuated by notifying the resource service and or management service that the user device is not authorized to access the resources .

In some embodiments the agent application executed on the user device may rely on the management server to determine whether a given functionality of the device such as viewing modifying transmitting and or receiving resources is authorized according to the compliance rules . For instance the agent application may transmit information such as the device profile and or user data to the management server so that the management server may determine whether the user device is authorized to perform the functionality. Additionally the management server may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests. For instance the management server may notify the resource service of whether the user device is authorized to access resources stored within the resource store . In other cases the management server might instruct the agent application on the user device to not allow resources to be accessed such as preventing the downloading viewing modification and or transmission of the resources .

In some embodiments the compliance rules may comprise user device settings and or executable instructions that define which functionality the operating system of the user device is authorized to perform. Furthermore the compliance rules may comprise a list of user device functions such as those provided by Application Programming Interface s API s associated with the operating system and or a platform library Depicted in that may be treated as protected user device functions. Accessing resources hosted by the resource server e.g. resources stored by the resource server in the resource store may comprise or otherwise be associated with one or more of these functions protected user device functions. Calls to these functions such as attempts to access the resources e.g. download receive transmit upload or modify the resources may result in checks by the user device e.g. via the agent application and or the management server e.g. via the management service to determine whether the user device satisfied the applicable compliance rules .

In some embodiments the agent application may perform a set of ordered operations to accomplish a requested user device function. These operation sets may be defined on e.g. stored in a memory of the user device s and or the management server and may comprise one or more operations to determine whether the user device is in compliance with compliance rules e.g. those stored within the compliance rule store of the management server . The agent application may control at least one respective computing resource of the user device . The operations may include configuring at least one respective computing resource of the user device such as restricting access to at least one resource hosted by the resource server that is managed by the agent application and or management service .

As shown in the user device management server and or resource server may communicate with one another directly and or via the network . The user device management server and or resource server may connect to the network via wired or wireless means such as via one or more intermediate networks. For example the user device s management server and or resource server may connect with the network via wired means such as Ethernet USB Universal Serial Bus or the like or via wireless means such as for example WI FI Bluetooth or the like or by connecting with a wireless cellular network such as a Long Term Evolution LTE network an LTE Advanced LTE A network a Global Systems for Mobile communications GSM network a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA network e.g. a Wideband CDMA WCDMA network a CDMA2000 network or the like a General Packet Radio Service GPRS network or other type of network .

A real world example involving securely authorizing access to remote resources may be useful to understand the above concepts. An employee of an enterprise may be provided a smartphone for use within her employment. The IT policy at the enterprise may require that smartphones used for enterprise purposes be managed by a management service administrated by the IT team of the enterprise. When the smartphone is provided to the employee the IT team may enroll the smartphone into the management service to satisfy the IT policy. As a part of using the smartphone for enterprise purposes the employee may need to utilize a resource access application that relies on certain resources hosted by a cloud based resource server . The cloud based resource server may not know whether the smartphone is authorized to access the hosted resource and or may have been instructed to rely on the management service s determination of whether the smartphone is authorized to access the hosted resources .

Accordingly the cloud based resource server may request that the management service make a determination of whether the smartphone is authorized to access the hosted resources . The management service may determine whether the smartphone has been issued a management identifier which may have occurred during enrollment of the smartphone into the management service . More specifically the management service may query its management record store to identify a management record associated with the smartphone and determine whether it contains the management identifier. Additionally or alternatively if the smartphone provided the cloud based resource server with a management identifier when requesting to access the hosted resources then the management service may request that the cloud based resource server provide the management identifier to the management service for validation. Depending on the requirements for authorization configured by the IT team administrating the management service the management service may further make a determination of whether the smartphone satisfies compliance rules configured by the IT team administrating the management service .

In response to the management service confirming that the smartphone is authorized to access the hosted resources the management service may notify the cloud based resource server that the smartphone is authorized. In such a scenario the cloud based resource server may rely on the confirmation of authorization provided by the management service in proceeding to transmit the hosted resources to the smartphone for use in its execution of the resource access application . On the contrary in response to the management service deciding that the smartphone is not authorized to access the hosted resources the management service may notify the cloud based resource server that the smartphone is not authorized. In such a scenario the cloud based resource server may rely on the denial of authorization provided by the management service in denying the transmission of the hosted resources to the smartphone. Additionally the management service may reconfigure the smartphone by transmitting configuration policies and or instructions to the smartphone that modify the smartphone in a manner which makes the smartphone authorized at which time the cloud based resource server may be further notified that the smartphone has been made authorized and which may trigger a transmission of the hosted resources from the cloud based resource server to the smartphone for using in its execution of the resource access application .
