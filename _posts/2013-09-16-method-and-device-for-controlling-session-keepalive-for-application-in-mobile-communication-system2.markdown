The present disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for controlling session keep alive for an application in a mobile communication system.

The recent emergence of smartphones has led to a sharp increase in Transport Control Protocol TCP based packet exchanges between User Equipments UEs and the Internet network. The TCP is generally used to transmit traffic requiring reliability or to transmit traffic requiring flow control over the Internet. The TCP operates based on an end to end session and a TCP session is generated by end to end handshaking. If an on going TCP session is not used for a predetermined time the TCP session is released. There are various types of TCP based service applications. Among the TCP based service applications for example a messenger and chatting service such as Kakao Talk or Google Talk often transmits a keep alive message to a server even in the absence of valid transmission data in order to prevent release of a TCP session.

For periodic transmission of a keep alive message a UE switches from idle mode to connected mode in spite of the absence of valid data. The state switching operation imposes a signaling processing load on the network and the periodic transmission of a keep alive message consumes battery power of the UE. Accordingly there is a need for a method for effectively keeping a TCP session alive.

The present disclosure provides a method and apparatus for controlling session keep alive for an application in a mobile communication system.

The present disclosure provides a method and apparatus for acquiring or resetting a preset session lifetime for a current established session and adjusting a transmission period of a message for keeping the session alive based on the acquired or reset session lifetime by a User Equipment UE .

In an aspect of the present disclosure a method for controlling session keep alive by a User Equipment UE in a mobile communication system includes upon starting of a new application setting request information about a session lifetime for the new application and transmitting the request information to a network and acquiring the session lifetime from the network and adjusting a transmission period of a message transmitted from the UE to keep a session alive using the session lifetime.

In another aspect of the present disclosure a UE for controlling session keep alive in a mobile communication system includes a setter configured upon starting of a new application to set request information about a session lifetime for the new application a transceiver configured to transmit the request information to a network and to acquire the session lifetime from the network and a transmission period controller configured to adjust a transmission period of a message transmitted from the UE to keep a session alive using the session lifetime.

In another aspect of the present disclosure a method for controlling session keep alive of a UE in a mobile communication system includes receiving request information about a session lifetime for a new application from the UE that has started the new application and resetting the session lifetime based on the request information and transmitting information about the reset session lifetime to the UE.

In another aspect of the present disclosure an apparatus for controlling session keep alive of a UE in a mobile communication system includes a controller configured upon receipt of request information about a session lifetime for a new application from the UE that has started the new application through a transceiver to reset the session lifetime based on the request information and to control the transceiver to transmit information about the reset session lifetime to the UE.

According to the present disclosure since a UE acquires a preset session lifetime for a session established for an on going application or resets the preset session lifetime to a requested lifetime and adjusts a transmission period of a message transmitted to keep the session alive based on the acquired or reset session lifetime the resulting decrease in unnecessary message transmissions and related state switching operations leads to reduction of the signaling and processing load of a network and the battery consumption of the UE.

Reference will be made to preferred embodiments of the present disclosure with reference to the attached drawings. Like reference numerals denote the same components although they are shown in different drawings. A detailed description of a generally known function and structure of the present disclosure will be avoided lest it should obscure the subject matter of the present disclosure. In addition although the terms used in the present disclosure are defined in consideration of functions of the present disclosure the terms may be changed according to the intention of a user or an operator or customs. Therefore the present disclosure must be understood not simply by the actual terms used but by the meaning of each term lying within.

Referring to a Radio Access Network RAN of the LTE mobile communication system includes an Evolved Node B ENB forming an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network EUTRAN a Mobility Management Entity MME and a Serving GateWay SGW . A User Equipment UE is connected to an external network through the ENB the SGW and a Packet Data Network GateWay PGW . An Application Function AF is a device that exchanges specific application level related information with the UE . A Policy Charging and Rules Function PCRF which controls a policy related to Quality of Service QoS of users is an entity that overall controls the QoS and charging of traffic A Policy and Charging Control PCC rule corresponding to the policy is transmitted to the PGW for application.

The ENB is a RAN node corresponding to for example a Radio Network Controller RNC in a UTRAN system and a Base Station Controller BSC in a GSM EDGE RAN GERAN system. The ENB is connected to the UE via a radio channel and functions similarly to a conventional RNC and BSC. The ENB may manage a plurality of cells simultaneously. In the LTE mobile communication system all user traffic transmitted by the Internet Protocol IP including a real time service such as Voice over IP VoIP is serviced on a shared channel. For this purpose the ENB schedules UEs by collecting state information about the UEs.

The SGW provides data bearers. The SGW generates or removes a data bearer under the control of the MME . The MME performs various control functions. One MME may be connected to a plurality of ENBs.

In the LTE mobile communication system illustrated in QoS is applied on an Evolved Packet System EPS bearer basis. One EPS bearer is used to transmit IP flows having the same QoS requirement. QoS related parameters may be set for the EPS bearer and may include a QoS Class Identifier QCI and an Allocation and Retention Priority ARP . An EPS bearer corresponds to for example a Packet Data Protocol PDP context in a General Packet Radio Service GPRS system. One EPS bearer belongs to a Packet Data Network PDN connection and the PDN connection may have an Access Point Name APN as an attribute. A RAN node manages EPS bearers by mapping the EPS bearers to logical channels.

Referring to a Network Access Translator NAT is generally used not to expose a public IP address assigned to a user of a UE in order to ensure security or used to service a plurality of users based on limited private IP addresses that can be assigned by a private network. While not shown in the NAT is deployed around a PGW to achieve this object. When the NAT is used to service a plurality of users based on limited public IP addresses the NAT is called a Network Address and Port Translation NAPT . The NAT enables use of one public IP address as up to 65535 private IP addresses. The NAT has a table in which private IP addresses and ports are mapped to limited public IP addresses and ports assigned to UEs. The NAT identifies a public IP address and port of a UE and transmits a private IP address and port mapped to the public IP address and port to the outside of a private network.

Specifically if a public IP address port assigned to UE is for example 1.1.1.1 3333 and a public IP address port assigned to UE is for example 2.2.2.2 3333 the NAT detects a private IP address port mapped to the public IP address port assigned to each of UE and UE . Then the NAT resets IP address port of UE and UE to private IP address extention port mapped to the public IP address port assigned to UE and UE that is 9.9.9.9 5555 and 9.9.9.9 5556 and transmits 9.9.9.9 5555 and 9.9.9.9 5556 to a server . The above operation for mapping the public IP address and port of a UE to a private IP address and extension port by the NAT will be referred to as port mapping herein.

The NAT maintains mapping between an IP address and port and an extension address and port for a UE for a predetermined time. If a user generates a TCP session to use a TCP based service application through the user s UE the NAT releases the mapping of an IP address and port assigned to the UE for the TCP session in the absence of packet transmission and reception for the TCP session for a predetermined time. Thus the TCP session may not be kept alive any longer. Accordingly the UE periodically transmits a keep alive message to a server in order to keep the TCP session alive in spite of no packet transmission and reception for the TCP session.

In the afore described LTE communication system if a UE does not perform data transmission and reception the UE generally releases a connection to a RAN node and switches to idle mode. However upon generation of a keep alive message the UE should switch from the idle mode to connected mode to transmit the keep alive message. During these operations huge signaling is generated between the UE and the RAN node and between the RAN node and a core network node.

In this context the present disclosure provides a method for acquiring a time during which a NAT maintains port mapping referred to as a session lifetime or resetting the session lifetime to a required value and adjusting a transmission period of a keep alive message based on the session lifetime by a UE. While embodiments of the present disclosure will be described basically in the context of a 3Generation Partnership Project 3GPP LTE system those skilled in the art will understand that slight modifications can be made to the subject matter of the embodiments of the present disclosure for application to other communication computer systems having similar technical backgrounds and system configurations within the scope of the present disclosure. Further while the embodiments of the present disclosure are described with the appreciation that a TCP session is used for the clarity of description the subject matter of the present disclosure is also applicable to the User Datagram Protocol UDP for example in order to prevent loss or retransmission of a UDP packet caused by deletion of address port mapping of an NAT.

Referring to for the convenience of description the mobile communication system is shown as including only a UE and a network . While not shown it is assumed that the network includes a server that provides an IP service such as a EUTRAN a core network and a virtual private network after the UE described with reference to .

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the UE includes an application executer a socket connection handler and a transmission and reception controller . The application executer executes a specific application according to a user s request and the socket connection handler manages the TCP IP or the UDP IP. The transmission and reception controller provides an Application Programming Interface API . In the above configuration of the UE particularly components that perform important operations according to embodiments of the present disclosure have been described.

For example it is assumed that a new service application is executed in the application executer . In this case the application executer requests the socket connection handler to open a new socket for the service application in operation . Then the socket connection handler generates a new socket according to the request and notifies the transmission and reception controller that an IP flow for the service application will be transmitted using the API provided by the transmission and reception controller in operation . The notification operation may be performed just by installing a packet filter representing a corresponding IP flow. Or the operation of operation may be replaced with an operation for transmitting a new packet through the generated new socket by the service application. Then the transmission and reception controller transmits a session lifetime request of a NAT or an intended session lifetime value in an EPS Session Management ESM request message based on the notified information that is transmission of a packet filter or a new packet in operation . The EMS request message is a message requesting a PDN connection or EPS bearer resources. The EMS request message includes for example a PDN connectivity request message a bearer resource modification allocation request message or the like. If the UE performs an initial attachment procedure the session lifetime may be included in an ESM request message inserted into an attach request message.

In operation the network transmits a current session lifetime of the NAT or a notification of resetting to the session lifetime value requested by the UE to the transmission and reception controller by an ESM accept message in response to the resource request. The ESM accept message is configured according to a Protocol Configuration Option PCO in which a session lifetime defined according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is inserted. The session lifetime is set uniquely by an operator or acquired from the NAT in methods according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The transmission and reception controller transmits the session lifetime to the socket connection handler in operation . In operation the socket connection handler transmits the session lifetime to the application executer . Then the application executor adjusts the transmission period of a keep alive message based on the session lifetime. Hereinbelow adjustment of the transmission period of a keep alive message based on the session lifetime implies for example setting of the transmission period of the keep alive message to a time shorter than the session lifetime of the NAT.

Now a description will be given of specific procedures for acquiring a current session lifetime of an NAT or requesting resetting of the session lifetime to a specific value by a UE according to embodiments of the present disclosure.

According to a first embodiment of the present disclosure a UE requests a current session lifetime of an NAT. The UE may set a requested session lifetime value and transmit it so as to reset the current session lifetime of the NAT. Or an operator may reset the current session lifetime to a session lifetime set in a PGW. The UE may acquire the current session lifetime of the NAT and may adjust the transmission period of a keep alive message of an on going application using the acquired session lifetime.

Referring to a UE starts a new application in operation and transmits a session lifetime request to an MME in operation . The session lifetime request is transmitted to the MME for example using a PCO of a PDN connectivity request message or a bearer resource modification allocation request message. In another example if the UE is performing an initial attachment procedure the UE transmits the session lifetime request in an ESM request message inserted in an attach request message to the MME . The session lifetime request may be included as one of parameters included in an additional parameter list in the PCO. A container identifier of the parameter may be set to Port Control Request PCR or Session Lifetime Request STP . In the presence of a session lifetime requested by the UE a container identifier contents field may be set to the session lifetime value. In the absence of a session lifetime requested by the UE the container identifier contents field is set to empty .

In operation the MME transmits the session lifetime request of the UE to a PGW . The session lifetime request is transmitted to the PGW for example through a PCO included in a Create session request message. Subsequently the PGW transmits the session lifetime request to the NAT according to the contents of the PCO or transmits the session lifetime value requested by the UE to the NAT . For example if the operator has a session lifetime set in the PGW or receives a session lifetime value requested by the UE the PGW transmits the operator set session lifetime value or the UE requested session lifetime value to the NAT by an information request in operation . In this case the NAT resets the current session lifetime to the operator set session lifetime value or the session lifetime value requested by the UE and indicates completion of the reset to the PGW for example by a PCP MAP response in operation . Or the NAT may consider its preset session lifetime value with priority. Then the NAT transmits its preset session lifetime value to the PGW along with the indication.

In another example if there is no operator set session lifetime value and the PGW does not acquire the session lifetime value requested by the UE the PGW requests the current session lifetime of the NAT to the NAT in operation . In operation the NAT transmits its current session lifetime value to the PGW for example by a PCP MAP response. Consequently the session lifetime value transmitted by the NAT in operation is the current session lifetime of the NAT .

In operation the PGW transmits the current session lifetime value of the NAT to the MME . The current session lifetime value indicates a session lifetime reset or currently used by the NAT and is transmitted to the MME for example through a PCO of a Create session response message or a Create Update Bearer Request message. The session lifetime is included as one of parameters included in an additional parameter list in the PCO as in the Create session message. A container identifier of the parameter may be set to PCP or STP. A container identifier contents field is set to the current session lifetime value.

In operation the MME transmits the acquired current session lifetime value to the UE . The current session lifetime value may be transmitted using a PCO of an ESM ACCEPT message such as a Session Management Request message or a PDN connectivity Accept message.

Then upon receipt of the current session lifetime used by the NAT the UE adjusts the transmission period of a keep alive message for the new application being executed using the received session lifetime in operation .

According to a second embodiment of the present disclosure a UE transmits its intended specific session lifetime value to a NAT through an MME. The specific session lifetime value is compared with a session lifetime value subscribed by the UE in subscriber information about the UE stored in a Home Subscriber Server HSS and the smaller value between the specific session lifetime value and the subscribed session lifetime value is transmitted to the NAT. In the absence of any session lifetime value subscribed by the UE in the subscriber information about the UE the HSS determines a subscribed session lifetime value corresponding to the subscriber information about the UE and transmits the determined session lifetime value to the NAT. Then the NAT resets its session lifetime to the determined session lifetime value and the UE acquires the reset session lifetime value. Thus the UE may adjust the transmission period of a keep alive message of an on going application using the reset session lifetime value.

Referring to a UE starts a new application in operation and transmits a specific session lifetime value to an MME in order to reset a session lifetime of a NAT in operation . The specific session lifetime value may be included in for example a session lifetime field of a PDN connectivity request message or a bearer resource modification allocation request message. In another example if the UE is performing an initial attachment procedure the UE transmits the specific session lifetime in an ESM request message inserted into an attach request message to the MME .

In operation the MME transmits an Update Location Request message or a message requesting subscriber information about the UE to a HSS . The HSS detects a pre stored session lifetime to which the UE has subscribed and transmits the subscribed session lifetime in subscription information about the UE to the MME in operation . The subscription information may be transmitted to the MME for example in an Update Location ACK being a response message to the Update Location Request message or in a subscriber information message. The subscribed session lifetime may be set differently according to the subscriber information about the UE that is a charging policy or a data service amount to which the UE has subscribed.

In operation the MME compares the specific session lifetime acquired from the UE with the subscribed session lifetime acquired from the HSS and determines the smaller value to be a session lifetime to be applied to the UE . Then the MME transmits the determined session lifetime to a PGW . The determined session lifetime is transmitted to the PGW for example in a GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP message that is a Create Session Request message or a bearer resource command message.

The PGW transmits the determined session lifetime to the NAT in operation . The determined session lifetime is transmitted to the NAT for example in a PCP MAP request message. In operation the NAT resets its current session lifetime to the determined session lifetime and transmits the reset session lifetime value to the PGW . The reset session lifetime value is transmitted to the PGW for example in a PCP MAP response message in response to the PCP MAP request message.

In operation the PGW transmits the reset session lifetime value to the MME . The reset session lifetime value is transmitted to the MME for example in a Create Session Response message or a Create Update Bearer Request message. Then the MME transmits the reset session lifetime value to the UE in operation . Herein the reset session lifetime value is inserted in a session lifetime field of an EMS ACCEPT message such as a Session Management Request message or a PDN connectivity Accept message. Or the PGW may transmit the determined session lifetime received from the NAT to the UE using a PCO as in the foregoing embodiment.

Subsequently the UE adjusts the transmission period of a keep alive message of the new application started in operation using the reset session lifetime value.

According to a third embodiment of the present disclosure when a PCRF generates PCC for an application the PCRF determines a session lifetime suitable for the application and transmits the determined session lifetime to a NAT. Accordingly the NAT resets a current session lifetime to the session lifetime determined by the PCRF and transmits the reset session lifetime to a UE through a PGW and an MME. Then the UE may adjust the transmission period of a keep alive message of the application based on the reset session lifetime.

Referring to a UE starts a new application in operation . In operation the UE transmits for example a bearer resource modification allocation request message in which a Traffic Aggregate Description TAD including packet filters for the new application is inserted to an MME . The MME transmits a Bearer Resource Command message with the TAD inserted in it to a PGW in operation . The PGW transmits the packet filters included in the TAD to a PCRF in operation . The packet filters are transmitted to the PCRF for example in an IP Connectivity Access Network IPCAN message requesting a PCC rule. Then the PCRF determines a session lifetime during generating PCC for each application and determines a session lifetime suitable for the new application started in operation during generating a PCC for the new application in operation .

Then the PCRF transmits the PCC rule including the determined session lifetime to the PGW for example in an IPCAN message. According to another embodiment the PCRF may transmit the determined session lifetime to the PGW by signaling through a Gx interface instead of using the PCC rule.

In operation the PGW transmits a port mapping request and the determined session lifetime for the application started in operation to the NAT . The port mapping request and the determined session lifetime are transmitted to the NAT in a PCP map request message. Then the NAT sets the current session lifetime to the determined session lifetime and transmits a result of the port mapping along with the set session lifetime to the PGW in operation .

In operation the PGW transmits the set session lifetime to the MME . Herein the set session lifetime is transmitted to the MME for example using a PCO of a Create Update Bearer Request message. The PCO may include the session lifetime request as one of parameters included in an additional parameter list. A container identifier of the parameter may be set to PCP and a container identifier contents field may be set to the set session lifetime. In operation the MME transmits the set session lifetime value to the UE . Herein the current session lifetime value is transmitted by inserting a PCO for example in an ESM ACCEPT message such as a Session Management Request message or a PDN connectivity Accept message.

Subsequently upon receipt of the session lifetime set by the NAT the UE may adjust the transmission period of a keep alive message for the new application started in operation using the set session lifetime.

According to a fourth embodiment of the present disclosure a UE sets a PCO including an intended session lifetime for an application and transmits the PCO to a NAT. Accordingly the NAT sets a current session lifetime to the session lifetime acquired from the PCO and transmits a PCO with the set session lifetime to the UE. Therefore the UE may adjust the transmission period of a keep alive message for the application based on the set session lifetime.

Referring to a UE starts a new application in operation and transmits a bearer resource modification allocation message to an MME in operation . The bearer resource modification allocation request message includes a TAD including packet filters for the application and a container identifier set to PCP in an additional parameter list of a PCO. A container identifier contents field is configured to include a UE intended session lifetime in a PCP MAP request message.

In operation the MME transmits the TAD and PCO of the ESM message acquired from the UE to a PGW for example in a Bearer resource command message or a bearer resource modification message. Then the PGW transmits the received PCP MAP request message to a NAT in operation . In operation the NAT sets a current session lifetime to the session lifetime included in the PCP MAP request message. The PGW may include the set session lifetime as one of parameters included in an additional parameter list of a PCO in operation . A container identifier of the parameter is set to PCP and for example a PCP MAP response received through the NAT is inserted in a container identifier contents field. The PGW transmits the set PCO to the MME for example in a Create Session Response message or a Create Update Bearer Request message. In operation the MME transmits an EMS ACCEPT message including the PCO to the UE . The EMS ACCEPT message corresponds to a Session Management Request message or a PDN connectivity Accept message.

Subsequently the PCP MAP Response message inserted in the PCO is transmitted to a PCP client. The PCP client may adjust the transmission period of a keep alive message for the new application started in operation using the session lifetime set by the NAT inserted in the PCP MAP Response message.

According to a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure information indicating whether a session lifetime setting function is supported or not is exchanged between a UE and a network and the transmission period of a keep alive message for an application is adjusted according to the result of the exchange.

Referring to a UE transmits information indicating that the UE supports a function of setting a session lifetime of a NAT hereinbelow referred to a PCP capable function to an MME in operation . The information indicating support or non support of the PCP capable function is transmitted using for example a PCO of a PDN connectivity request message or a bearer resource modification allocation request message. In another example if the UE performs an initial attachment procedure the information indicating support or non support of the PCP capable function is transmitted to the MME by an ESM message inserted into an attach request message. Capability information about the session lifetime may be included as one of parameters in an additional parameter list in the PCO. A container identifier of the parameter is set to PCP and a container identifier contents field may be set to empty or a specific session lifetime value requested by the UE .

In operation the MME transmits the PCO acquired from the UE to a PGW for example in a Create session request message.

Then the PGW performs a port mapping request and session life time negotiation operation with the NAT in operation . Specifically the PGW requests a current session lifetime to the NAT and acquires it from the NAT . If the PGW has a preset session lifetime or acquires a UE requested session lifetime from the PCO the PGW compares the preset session lifetime the UE requested session lifetime and the current session lifetime acquired from the NAT and determines the smallest lifetime value as a session lifetime for the NAT . Then the PGW transmits the determined session lifetime to the NAT . Upon receipt of the determined session lifetime the NAT sets the determined session lifetime as the current session lifetime and indicates completion of the setting to the PGW .

In operation the PGW transmits the determined session lifetime in a PCO to the MME . The determined session lifetime is transmitted along with information indicating whether the PGW supports the PCP capable function to the MME for example in a Create session response message or a Create Update Bearer Request message. The determined session lifetime may be included as one of parameters included in an additional parameter list in the PCO. A container identifier of the parameter may be set to PCP indicating support of the PCP capable function or Port Control Not Supported indicating non support of the PCP capable function. A container identifier contents field is set to the determined session lifetime. In operation the MME transmits the PCO to the UE . The PCO is inserted in an ESM ACCEPT message such as a Session Management Request message or a PDN connectivity Accept message and transmitted to the UE .

Upon receipt of the PCO the UE may adjust the transmission period of a keep alive message for the application using the session lifetime acquired from the PCO. Or the UE determines whether the PGW supports the PCP capable function from the PCO and determines the following operation according to the determination.

With reference to an operation of each apparatus that performs an important operation according to each embodiment of the present disclosure will be described below.

Referring to the UE sets a request for a current session lifetime of a NAT and related information and transmits them to a network in operation . According to the first and second embodiments of the present disclosure the UE may set an intended session lifetime value as the related information and transmit it. How the session lifetime or the related information is transmitted has been described with reference to each embodiment and thus will not be described herein in detail. Particularly in the fourth embodiment of the present disclosure the session lifetime or the related information is inserted in a message using a PCO. In the fifth embodiment of the present disclosure the UE includes information indicating support or non support of the PCP capable function as the related information.

In operation the UE acquires the current session lifetime of the NAT. The current session lifetime of the NAT is given as a different value according to each embodiment. For example the current session lifetime of the NAT may be set to a UE requested specific session lifetime value in the first embodiment of the present disclosure and to a session lifetime set in subscription information about the UE in the second embodiment of the present disclosure. In the third embodiment of the present disclosure the current session lifetime of the NAT may be set to a session lifetime determined when PCC is generated for a new application that the UE has started.

In operation the UE adjusts the transmission period of a keep alive message in a TCP session using the current session lifetime value.

Referring to the MME acquires a UE s session lifetime that a UE wants to set in operation . The procedure for acquiring the UE s session lifetime has been described in detail with reference to and thus will not be described herein in detail.

In operation the MME acquires a UE s subscribed session lifetime included in subscriber information about the UE. Then the MME selects the smaller value between the UE s session lifetime and the UE s subscribed session lifetime in operation and transmits the selected session lifetime to a NAT through a PGW in operation . Then the MME acquires a session lifetime to which the NAT resets the current session lifetime using the selected session lifetime and transmits the acquired session lifetime to the UE in operation .

Referring to the PGW acquires a session lifetime determined during generation of PCC for a new application that a UE has started from a PCRF in operation .

In operation the PGW transmits a port mapping request for the application along with the determined session lifetime to a NAT. The PGW receives a session lifetime reset based on the determined session lifetime from the NAT in operation and transmits the reset session lifetime through the MME in operation .

Referring to a NAT includes for example a controller and a transceiver . When the transceiver senses reception of information requesting a session lifetime for a new application from a UE that has started the new application the controller acquires a specific session lifetime intended by the UE and information indicating whether the UE supports the PCP capable function from the request information. The request information may be received using a PCO in a resource request to the network or a message transmitted during initial attachment.

Then the controller may reset the session lifetime to the smaller value between the UE intended session lifetime value acquired from the request information and a subscribed session lifetime included in subscriber information about the UE. Further the controller may reset the session lifetime based on a session lifetime determined when PCC is generated for the new application. The controller controls the transceiver to transmit information about the reset session lifetime to the UE.

According to the above embodiments of the present disclosure a UE acquires a TCP session lifetime during a port mapping operation of a NAT and adjusts the transmission period of a keep alive message for the application using the acquired session lifetime. Therefore unnecessary transmissions of the keep alive message and unnecessary UE state transitions can be reduced.

While the present disclosure has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
