This patent application claims priority filing benefit from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 772 390 filed Mar. 4 2013 which application is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Computing devices are ubiquitous in today s society. Many people own computing devices that can be loaded with applications or software to perform very specific operations. These devices when loaded with proper software may be used to control devices such as televisions lights door locks and other types of devices. Often when computing devices are used to perform functions of existing devices e.g. remote controls etc. the software designers create software for the computing devices with the same or very similar functionality as the traditional devices. Although this may allow a user to perform desired operations with the computing device this type of design may fail to leverage performance opportunities that are available with use of the computing device such as use of global positioning information network access and or other functionality or hardware included in the computing device.

Described herein are methods and systems that allow modification of functionalities based on distances between a shared device e.g. a shared display etc. and an individual device e.g. a mobile computing device etc. and or on relative orientations between the shared device and a user operating the individual device.

In some embodiments the shared device may be in communication with the individual device. The shared device may then measure a distance between the shared device and the individual device. The shared device may translate the distance into a mode of operation. The shared device may then transmit this mode of operation and or the measured distance to the individual device. The individual device after receiving the mode of operation or possibly the measured distance may then modify a functionality of the individual device such as by providing display of a user interface that corresponds to the mode of operation or the measured distance received from the shared device. In some embodiments the individual device may measure the distance between the shared device and the individual device.

In various embodiments the shared device may track distances associated with multiple individual devices. The shared device may identify one of the individual devices and provide information such as distance information and or mode of operation information to that respective individual device while providing different distance information and or mode of operation information to another one of the individual devices.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

This disclosure is directed in part to systems and techniques to modify a functionality of an individual device e.g. a mobile computing device etc. based on a distance between the individual device and a share device e.g. a shared display etc. . For example a user interface implemented by the mobile computing device may be automatically determined and or modified based on distances between the mobile computing device and the shared display.

In various embodiments the shared device may connect with the individual device by performing a connection protocol such as a handshake or pairing of information. After connecting the shared device may measure a distance between the shared device and the individual device. Based on the distance the shared device may determine a mode of operation to be implemented by the individual device. In some embodiments the shared device may determine the mode of operation based on an orientation of a user operating the individual device in relation to the shared device and or an absolute orientation associated with the user. The shared device may then instruct the individual device to perform a function and or modify a functionality based on the mode of operation. For example the shared device may transmit the mode of operation to the individual device. The individual device may determine the function based on the mode of operation and then perform the function. In some instances the shared device may detect a change of the distance in response to movement of the user. The shared device may update the mode corresponding to the changed distance and instruct the individual device to modify the functionality corresponding to the updated mode. In some embodiments the shared device may transmit the distance information to the individual device. The individual device may then change a mode of operation based on the distance information e.g. provide a different user interfaces based on different distance ranges etc. .

In some embodiments the individual device may measure a distance between the shared device and the individual device and or update distance information. For example the individual device may detect a display associated with the shared device and measure a distance between the display and the individual device. Based on the distance the individual device may determine and or updated a mode of operation associated with a user interface and perform a function corresponding to the mode of operation.

In various embodiments the shared device may track distances associated with multiple individual devices. The shared device may identify one of the individual devices and provide information such as distance information and or mode of operation information to that respective individual device while providing different distance information and or mode of operation information to another one of the individual devices.

The share device may be in communication with an individual device . The individual device may be a mobile computer a mobile telephone e.g. smart phone a personal computer a laptop computer a portable digital assistant PDA a game console a personal media player PMP a digital still camera a digital video camera a personal navigation device or any other computing device capable of exchanging data with another device e.g. a sensing device and producing outputs e.g. a visual representation which can be used with various devices e.g. a display . In some embodiments the shared device may be in communication with multiple individual devices. For example the shared device may receives information from the multiple individual devices and produce one or more visual representations which are surfaced in the interface and shown on the display .

The shared device may established a connection with the individual device through a communication process such as a handshake pairing exchange of credentials and or by using any other processes. In some instances the shared device may establish the connection when the individual device is in proximity of the shared device the display and or the sensing device . In some embodiments the connection may be initialized by the shared device or the individual device . In some embodiments the connection may be established via one or more networks . The networks may include any one or combination of multiple different types of networks such as cable networks the Internet and wireless networks e.g. Bluetooth Wi Fi mobile telephone networks etc. . For example the individual device may communicate with the shared device using a hardware address of the shared device that was exchanged during the communication process.

In various embodiments the shared device may detect a user operating the individual device and track movement of the user within a certain range using the sensing device . The shared device may also measure a distance between the user and the shared device using the sensing device . Based on the distance the shared device may determine a mode associated with the individual device . For example the shared device may determined the mode by using a predetermined relationship between multiple modes and distances which may be grouped and sorted into a table accessible by the shared device . The shared device may transmit information associated with the mode to instruct the individual device to perform a function corresponding to the mode.

In some embodiments the shared device may determine the mode associated with the individual device based on a physical distance e.g. a linear distance between the sensing device and the individual device and or a social distance e.g. an orientation of the user in relation to the sensing device . For example when detecting that the user stands at a position and faces to the sensing device and or display the shared device may instruct the individual device to perform a function. However the shared device may instruct the individual device to perform another function when detecting the user stands at the position but faces away from the sensing device and or display .

The shared device may detect movement of the user . For example the user may move from the position to a position as indicated by gray arrows in . The shared device may measure a distance in response to the movement of the user . The shared device may then determine the mode associated with the individual device based on the distance . If the distance corresponding to a different mode the shared device may update the mode and instruct the individual device to modify the current functionality associated with the individual device such as performing a function corresponding to the updated mode.

For example the distance may be less than a reachable distance by the user . In other words the user may directly interact with the display e.g. a touch screen . Suppose that a menu mode corresponds to the distance . As a result the shared device may show a whiteboard on the display and instruct the individual device to perform a first menu function. For example the individual device may present a color palette in a user interface such that the user may paint on the display while controlling colors via the individual device .

In some embodiments the movement of the user may include a change in orientation of the user in relation to the sensing device and or display . The shared device may then determine the mode associated with the individual device based on a change in distance and or orientation. For example if the changed distance and or orientation corresponds to a different mode the shared device may update the mode and instruct the individual device to modify the current functionality associated with the individual device .

In addition when the shared device detects that the user moves from the position to the position the shared device may transmit a command to modify a functionality of the individual device . In some embodiments the shared device may measure the distance and determine that the distance is greater than the reachable distance. In other words the user is further away from the display at the position than at the position . Suppose that a second menu function such as a remote control function corresponds to the distance . As a result the shared device may instruct the individual device to perform a remote control function. For example the individual device may function as a remote input device e.g. a virtual pointing device and virtual keyboard such that the user may remotely control the display via the individual device while at the distance from the display .

In various embodiments the shared device may provide distance information to the individual device . The individual device may then determine the mode of operation based on the received distance operation.

In some embodiments the individual device may measure the distance and determine a mode based on the distance . Accordingly the individual device may perform a function corresponding to the mode. For example based on the predetermined relationship between multiple modes and distances the individual device may determine a mode associated with a user interface corresponding to the distance and then perform a function corresponding to the mode.

In some embodiments the mode associated with the individual device may be determined based on the distance and context. The context may be a task that the user the shared device and or the individual device are performing. Accordingly while the user is within a same distance from the display the individual device may perform different functions in response to different tasks that the shared device operates and thus based on the context of operation of the shared device . For example the individual device may function as a color palette when the user is painting on the display using a painting application one example context while as a virtual keyboard when the user is making a presentation on the display using presentation software another example context . In these instances the distances between the user and the shared device are the same yet the context of operation of the shared device is different. In some embodiments the context may include orientation information associated with the individual devices and or the shared device . For example content may be viewed in a portrait or landscape orientation via the individual devices and or the shared device .

In some embodiments the shared device may track multiple users operating multiple individual devices via the sensing device . In some instances the shared device may track the multiple users by identifying features of individual users and associating the individual users with one or more individual devices that the individual users are operating. For example the shared device may identify an individual user based on user characteristics e.g. voice facial features and or body features etc. and or based on other tracking information associated with the individual user e.g. device identifiers marker identifiers self registration etc. . For further example using the sensing device the shared device may track multiple users and measure distances between the individual user and the display . Accordingly based on the distances the shared device may determine one or more modes and instruct the multiple individual devices to perform respective functions corresponding to individual mode.

In some embodiments the shared device may measure distances between multiple users and the display . Based on the distances the shared device may assign to the multiple users different modes authorities and or permissions associated with a task that the multiple users are involved. For example the shared device may assign higher authorities to certain users that are within a certain distance from the display . In these instances these certain users may have permits to modify a document while other users may only have permits to access the document. In some instances the multiple individual devices may be in communication with each other. Using this communication multiple users associated with the multiple individual devices may collaborate with a task that the shared device and or the multiple individual devices are operating. For example the individual device e.g. a mobile phone may in communication with another individual device e.g. a stylus to allow multiple users to collaborate side by side with their own palette while a whiteboard is shown on the display e.g. a Perceptive Pixel display while a globally unique identifier GUID is assigned to the stylus.

In some embodiments the environment may also include server s associated with a service provider that provides services e.g. cloud storage external content etc. to the shared device and or the individual device . In some instances while interacting with the shared device the individual device may access the services of the service provide via the networks . For example the user may request a mapping service from the service provider . The shared device may receive mapping information e.g. a map and present the map information on the display . Some mapping information may also be provided to the individual device although this mapping information may be different than the mapping information provided to the shared device .

In addition the shared device may present a requested visual representation e.g. an image text etc. on the display using display parameters that indicate information on how to display the visual presentation. Example display parameters may be a font of text that is displayed or a size of an image displayed by the shared device . In these instances the display parameters may change e.g. increasing or decreasing font size image size etc. in response to a change of the distance between the user and the display . For example the individual device may decrease a font size of text or a size of an image when detecting that the user moves towards to the display . On the other hand the individual device may increase a font size or a size of the image when detecting that the user moves away from the display .

In another example using another context of operation the distance of between the user or the individual device and the shared device may be used to control a zooming of the imagery displayed by the shared device . For example as the user moves toward the shared device the imagery on the interface may show a more detailed view but less information such as to facilitate zooming in on a location on a map. Conversely detected movement of the user moving away from the shared device may cause the shared device to display a zoomed out display that includes additional imagery but at a smaller scale. Thus the distance information and or mode of operation may be used by the shared device to update the interaction with the interface possibly based on the context of the operation of the shared device .

Alternatively or in addition the functionally described herein regarding the shared device and the individual device may be performed at least in part by one or more hardware logic components. For example and without limitation illustrative types of hardware logic components that may be used include Field programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs Program specific Integrated Circuits ASICs Program specific Standard Products ASSPs System on a chip systems SOCs Complex Programmable Logic Devices CPLDs etc.

In some embodiments the shared device may include at least one processing unit and system memory . Depending on the exact configuration and type of computing device the system memory may be volatile such as RAM non volatile such as ROM flash memory etc. or some combination of the two.

The system memory may include an operating system one or more program modules and may include program data as well as device data . In some instances the device data may store information associated with devices e.g. the individual device that have connected and or are to be connected with the shared device . The program modules may include a communication module a sensing module a functionality module a display module and or a context module each discussed in turn.

The communication module may be configured to communicate with devices such as the individual device and or the servers . In some embodiments the communication module may connect with the individual device by performing a connection protocol such as a handshake pairing of information exchange of credentials and or by using other connection protocols. For example the shared device and the individual device may be Bluetooth capable devices. Accordingly a personal area network PANs may be created between the shared device and the individual device .

The sensing module may be configured to detect the user and measure a distance between the display and the user e.g. the distance or a distance between the display and the individual device . For example combining with the sensing device the sensing module may perform partial or full body three dimension motion capture facial recognition and or voice recognition. In some embodiments the sensing module may track movement of the user and or the individual device and update the distance information e.g. the distance or .

Based on the distance information the functionality module may determine a mode of operation to be performed by the individual device . For example the functionality module may determine the mode using illustrative predetermined corresponding relationships between multiple modes and distances that is listed below in Table 1 which may be implemented as a lookup table. In some embodiments there may be a distance threshold for transitioning between modes. In these instances the distance threshold may be different in one direction than in the other such as to provide hysteresis between state changes. For example the hysteresis may avoid undesirable false transitions due to a noise associated with movement of the user or when the user happens to be standing at one of the distance thresholds. In some embodiments each mode may be associated with multiple variants e.g. near and far variants which may entail a blending or easing of the visuals and or functionality of one distance based mode into another.

After mode determination the communication module may transmit a command to instruct the individual device to perform a function corresponding to the determined mode.

In some embodiments the predetermined corresponding relationship may also include functions corresponding to the distances and the modes which are listed in illustrative Table 2 and may be implemented as a lookup table. In some embodiments the display module may display the interface corresponding to the function that is performed by the individual device . For example the display module may display a whiteboard when the user is within a reachable distance from the display and the individual device functions as a color palette.

In some instances the program modules may also include a context module configured to determine context such as a task that is operated on the shared device and or the individual device . In these instances the functionality module may determine the mode based on the distance and or context. For example the predetermined corresponding relationship between the distances and modes may be context specific which is listed below in illustrative Table 3 which may be implemented as a lookup table.

In some embodiments the operating system includes a component based framework that supports components including properties and events objects inheritance polymorphism reflection and the operating system may provide an object oriented component based application programming interface API . Again a terminal may have fewer components but will interact with a computing device that may have such a basic configuration.

The shared device may have additional features or functionality. For example the shared device may also include additional data storage devices removable and or non removable such as for example magnetic disks optical disks or tape. Such additional storage is illustrated in by removable storage and non removable storage .

Computer readable media may include at least two types of computer readable media namely computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media may include volatile and non volatile removable and non removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data. The system memory the removable storage and the non removable storage are all examples of computer storage media. Computer storage media includes RAM ROM EEPROM flash memory or other memory technology CD ROM digital versatile disks DVD or other optical storage magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium that may be used to store the desired information and which may be accessed by the shared device . Any such computer storage media may be part of the shared device . Moreover the computer readable media may include computer executable instructions that when executed by the processor unit s cause the shared device to perform various functions and or operations described herein.

In contrast communication media may embody computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transmission mechanism. As defined herein computer storage media does not include communication media.

The shared device may also have input device s such as keyboard voice input device touch input device e.g. stylus pen etc. touch screen device navigation devices e.g. track pad mouse etc. etc. In some embodiments input methods may be implemented via Natural User Interface NUI . NUI may include any interface technology that enables a user to interact with a device in a natural manner free from artificial constraints imposed by input devices such as mice keyboards remote controls and the like. Examples of NUI methods may include those relying on speech recognition touch and stylus recognition gesture recognition both on screen and adjacent to the screen air gestures head and eye tracking voice and speech vision touch gestures and machine intelligence. Categories of NUI technologies may include touch sensitive displays voice and speech recognition intention and goal understanding motion gesture detection using depth cameras such as stereoscopic camera systems infrared camera systems RGB camera systems and combinations of these motion gesture detection using accelerometers gyroscopes facial recognition 3D displays head eye and gaze tracking immersive augmented reality and virtual reality systems all of which provide a more natural interface as well as technologies for sensing brain activity using electric field sensing electrodes EEG and related methods .

In some embodiments the shared device may include the sensing device that receives and or responses to an input signal generated via methods such as NUI. For example the sensing device may be a motion sensing input device that receives and or responses to signals used for partial or full body three dimension motion capture facial recognition and voice recognition. In some instances the sensing device may track one or more users in various conditions e.g. complete darkness by tracking users bodies e.g. skeletons and appendage . The appendage may include arms legs and heads of the users.

The shared device may also output device s such as a display e.g. the display speakers printer etc. The shared device may also contain communication connections that allow the device to communicate with other computing devices e.g. the individual device such as over a network such as the networks .

The sensing module is configured to measure a distance between the display and the individual device . In some embodiments the sensing module may detect the display and measure the distance between the display and the individual device by using a distance measuring device or other input devices associated with the individual device such as a camera. For example when combined with imagery from a camera the sensing module may detect and or recognize an reference feature of the display such as a frame of the display or other object image located on or near the display and then measure or approximate the distance between the individual device and the display based on changes in the size of the reference feature of the display as sensed by the imagery from the camera or other data. The sensing module may update the distance information at any different interval periodic after detected movement random etc. in response to movement of the individual device .

Based on the distance information the functionality module may determine a mode associated with the individual device .

The individual device may determine the distance based on information from the distance measuring device which may measure or approximate the distance between the individual device and the display based on a size of a reference feature as discussed above.

At based on the measured distance from the operation a mode to be implemented by the individual device may be determined.
