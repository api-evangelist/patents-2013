This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT JP2013 064946 filed May 29 2013 claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 160566 filed Jul. 19 2012 the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to silver nanoparticles which have excellent dispersibility in a solvent and are capable of providing on a substrate a silver element such as a silver film or line having excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity to a substrate through low temperature sintering at not higher than 150 C. as well as to a method for preparing the same a dispersion liquid containing the silver nanoparticles and a substrate having a silver element formed thereon.

There is known a method for forming a metal film by preparing a liquid or paste ink of a metal and applying or printing the ink on a substrate followed by warming. The metal used here may be gold silver copper or aluminum with silver being generally used as a wiring material. Ink with silver which usually contains silver metal dispersed in a dispersion solvent is patterned on an interconnection substrate and silver metal in the ink is sintered to form wiring. It is known that when used as an electrically conductive material silver metal is required to be sintered at a lower temperature making use of melting point depression caused by the fine size of the dispersed silver metal particles. Fine metal nanoparticles of a nanoscale are raising expectations as a material sintering at a low temperature.

On the other hand silver metal particles of such a fine size as to cause melting point depression are prone to contact and aggregate with each other and a dispersant is required in the ink for preventing such aggregation. However sintering the silver metal particles in the ink containing a dispersant may result in residual impurities originated from the dispersant. It is thus usually desired to remove the impurities by a high temperature treatment or the like.

A general method of preparing silver nanoparticles includes for example reducing a silver salt composed of an inorganic acid and silver such as silver nitrate in the presence of a dispersant. With this method however a residual acid component originated from the silver salt may result and high temperature treatment is required for removal of the dispersant.

A method of forming silver metal with a silver salt containing an organic acid instead of the inorganic acid has also been reported. The organic silver proposed is for example silver salt of long chain carboxylic acid which is thermally decomposed or reduced in the presence of an alkylamine Patent Publications 1 to 5 . To the silver nanoparticles prepared from any organic silver carboxylic acid or silver carboxylate is adhered which is nonvolatile and thermally decomposed at higher temperatures. Thus in order to obtain a silver element such as silver film or line of excel lent electrical conductivity heat treatment at not lower than 200 C. for a prolonged period of time may be required.

There have recently been made active attempts to form silver metal on a transparent resin substrate. A transparent resin substrate generally has a lower softening point compared to glass or the like and thus a silver forming material sintering at low temperatures is desired which realizes formation of silver metal through heating at not higher than 150 C. Sintering at low temperatures calls for removal at low temperatures of the dispersant adhered on the silver nanoparticles. Further for the production of a durable metal resin substrate strong bond is required between the transparent resin substrate and the silver element.

As means for low temperature sintering there has been proposed a method of mixing silver oxalate and amine to produce silver nanoparticles of silver oxalate amine complex having a thermal decomposition temperature of 110 C. Patent Publication 6 . The silver nanoparticles obtained by this method provide a silver element such as a metal film having good electrical conductivity through sintering at not higher than 150 C. but this publication discloses nothing about durability including adhesivity of the obtained silver element. It is assumed that pure silver element obtained by such a mechanism of action to leave no residual organic substance in the resulting film has poor adhesivity to a substrate.

On the other hand as means for improving adhesivity or strength of a silver element there has been reported to use a composition wherein an organic polymer having a urethane group and a diol group is hybridized with an inorganic material Patent Publication 7 . However with an organic polymer which will remain as a resistive component in the resulting electrically conductive film electrical conductivity comparable to bulk silver is hard to be achieved.

It is an object of the present invention to provide silver nanoparticles having excellent dispersion stability in a solvent and capable of forming on a substrate a silver element such as a silver film or line having excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity through heating even at a lower temperature for a short time as well as a method for preparing the same and a dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticle. It is also an object of the present invent ion to provide use of the silver nanoparticles or the dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticle for the formation on a substrate of a silver element such as a silver film or line having excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a substrate having a silver element such as a silver film or line formed thereon with excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity as well as a method for producing the substrate having a silver element formed thereon.

According to the present invention there is provided silver nanoparticles obtained by reduction treatment treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment of a silver containing composition comprising 

polymer C obtained by polymerization of a monomer composition comprising diol meth acrylate compound c1 having a urethane bond represented by formula 2 

wherein a content of said amine compound B is 1 to 50 mole equivalent of silver elements in said silver compound A and a content of said polymer C is 0.1 to 0.9 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of silver elements in said silver compound A .

According to the present invention there is also provided a method for preparing silver nanoparticles comprising reduction treatment treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment of a silver containing composition comprising the silver compound A represented by the formula 1 the amine compound B having a primary amino group and the polymer C wherein a content of said amine compound B is 1 to 50 mole equivalent of silver elements in said silver compound A and a content of said polymer C is 0.1 to 0.9 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of silver elements in said silver compound A .

According to the present invention there is further provided a dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles comprising the silver nanoparticles and a solvent sometimes referred to as a present dispersion liquid hereinbelow .

According to the present invention there is also provided a substrate having a silver element formed thereon by applying the present dispersion liquid on a substrate followed by heating.

The silver nanoparticles according to the present invention which have been obtained by reduction treatment treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment of a silver containing composition containing the silver compound A the amine compound B and the polymer C at a particular ratio are excellent in dispersion stability in a solvent. The dispersion liquid according to the present invention which contains the silver nanoparticles and a solvent is capable of forming on a substrate a silver element such as a silver film or line with excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity at a lower temperature of not higher than 150 C. Further sintering at a lower temperature of not higher than 150 C. the dispersion liquid of the present invention is capable of forming a silver element on a resin substrate of a low heat resistance. The silver element thus obtained which exhibits the properties similar to those of bulk silver maybe expected to be applied not only to wiring materials making use of its electrical conductivity but also to various fields including reflective or antibacterial materials.

The silver nanoparticles according to the present invention is obtained by the method of the present invention including reduction treatment of a silver containing composition containing silver compound A represented by the formula 1 amine compound B having a primary amino group and particular polymer C at a particular ratio.

The silver compound A is silver acetonedicarboxylate and is usually in the form of powder. The silver compound A is low in solubility in a solvent and cannot undergo reduction reaction in a homogeneous system so that stably dispersible nanoparticles are hard to result. However by combining the silver compound A with the amine compound B having a primary amino group the silver compound A dissolves to proceed with the reduction reaction in a homogeneous system. Further the organic structure acetonedicarboxylic acid of the silver compound A decomposes into a volatile compound in the reaction system to leave silver only so that the resulting silver nanoparticles contain no residual nonvolatile carboxylic acid which allows formation of a silver element such as a silver metal film or line through heat treatment at not higher than 150 C.

Thus the silver nanoparticles according to the present invention may be used in the formation on a substrate of a silver element such as a silver film or line with excellent electrical conductivity and adhesivity.

In the silver containing composition the content of the amine compound B is 1 to 50 mole equivalent of the silver elements in the silver compound A . At less than 1 mole equivalent a homogeneous solution cannot be prepared and precipitation is prone to form in the reduction. Over 50 mole equivalent effects commensurate with the content cannot be achieved.

The amine compound B is not particularly limited as long as it has in its structure a primary amino group which is easy to be coordinated in the silver compound A . Examples of the amine compound B may include 1 butylamine 1 amylamine 1 hexylamine 1 heptylamine 1 octylamine 1 nonylamine 1 decylamine 1 undecylamine 1 dodecylamine 1 tridecylamine 1 tetradecylamine 1 pentadecylamine 1 hexadecylamine 1 octadecylamine 2 ethylhexylamine isobutylamine isoamylamine sec butylamine tert butylamine tert amylamine allylamine oleylamine benzylamine 2 phenethylamine 3 methoxypropylamine 3 ethoxypropylamine 3 isopropoxypropylamine 3 butoxypropylamine 2 ethylhexyloxypropylamine 3 decyloxypropylamine dibutylaminopropylamine dimethylaminopropylamine diethylaminopropylamine and diisopropylaminoethylamine. One or a mixture of two or more of these may be used.

For the purpose of rendering the silver nanoparticles of the present invention particularly excellent in low temperature sintering the amine compound B preferably has a structure which facilitates its removal from the film upon sintering such as 1 butylamine 1 amylamine 1 hexylamine 1 heptylamine 1 octylamine 2 ethylhexylamine isobutylamine isoamylamine sec butylamine tert butylamine tert amylamine allylamine 3 methoxypropylamine 3 ethoxypropylamine 3 isopropoxypropylamine dimethylaminopropylamine diethylaminopropylamine and diisopropylaminoethylamine. One or a mixture of two or more of these may be used.

For the purpose of rendering the silver nanoparticles of the present invention particularly excellent in stability in a solvent the amine compound B preferably has a structure with a side chain which causes steric repulsion such as 1 decylamine 1 undecylamine 1 dodecylamine 1 tridecylamine 1 tetradecylamine 1 pentadecylamine 1 hexadecylamine 1 octadecylamine oleylamine 2 ethylhexyloxypropylamine 3 decyloxypropylamine and dibutylaminopropylamine. One or a mixture of two or more of these may be used.

For the purpose of imparting both the low temperature sintering and dispersion stability in a solvent to the silver nanoparticles of the present invention two or more of the amine compound B may be used together at an arbitrary ratio which may suitably be selected according to the desired low temperature sintering and dispersion stability.

The polymer C is a copolymer obtained by polymerization of a monomer composition containing diol meth acrylate compound c1 having a urethane bond represented by the formula 2 sometimes referred to as monomer c1 hereinbelow and at least one monomer c2 selected from meth acrylate monomers acrylamide monomers vinyl monomers vinyl ether monomers or monomers having an epoxy group.

The polymer C has a polar urethane group and two hydroxyl groups a diol group structurally derived from the monomer c1 . Each of the urethane and hydroxyl groups alone does not have a very strong interaction with silver but as the three groups are arranged adjacent to each other the polymer C may efficiently be adsorbed on the surfaces of the silver nanoparticles due to the coordination of the three groups and may have improved dispersion stability due to the steric repulsion of the remaining polymer chain. When the silver nanoparticles of the present invention are prepared into a dispersion liquid and applied to and heated on a substrate the polymer C is desorbed from the surfaces of the silver nanoparticles and will not interfere with the silver element formation. Further the polymer C having been desorbed from the nanoparticle surfaces is directed toward the interface to tightly adhere the resulting silver element such as a silver metal film or line to the substrate.

In the formula 2 representing the monomer c1 Ris a hydrogen atom or a methyl group with a methyl group being preferred for easy molecular weight regulation. Ris CH and n is an integer of 1 to 4. Ris specifically any of CH CHCH CHCHCH or CHCHCHCH with CH and CHCH being preferred for their availability.

The monomer c1 may be for example glycerol 1 methacryloyloxyethyl urethane or glycerol 1 acryloyloxyethyl urethane with the former being preferred for its ready synthesis.

The monomer c1 may be synthesized for example according to a method disclosed in Patent Publication 7.

The meth acrylate monomers as the monomer c2 may be for example methyl meth acrylate butyl meth acrylate isobutyl meth acrylate lauryl meth acrylate stearyl meth acrylate dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylate 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate 2 methoxyethyl meth acrylate 3 methacryloyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane naphthylmethacrylate 2 methyl 2 adamantyl meth acrylate 2 perfluorohexyl ethyl meth acrylate or 1H 1 trifluoromethyl trifluoroethylacrylate.

The acrylamide monomers as the monomer c2 may be for example acrylamide N methylacrylamide N ethylacrylamide N methylolacrylamide N isopropylacrylamide N N dimethylacrylamide N N diethylacrylamide or N N diisopropylacrylamide.

The vinyl monomers as the monomer c2 may be for example styrene 2 chlorostyrene bromostyrene vinylcarbazole or perfluorohexylethylene.

The monomers having an epoxy group as the monomer c2 may be for example glycidyl meth acrylate 3 4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl meth acrylate or 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate glycidylether.

In the monomer composition the compositional ratio by mole of the monomer c1 and the monomer c2 monomer c1 monomer c2 is preferably 20 80 to 90 10 more preferably 30 70 to 80 20. At less than 20 in molar ratio of the monomer c1 the adsorption efficiency to the resulting silver nanoparticles may be low to lower the dispersion stability. At over 90 in molar ratio of the monomer c1 the resulting polymer C may associate together to lower the affinity to and thus the dispersion stability in a solvent.

The molecular weight of the polymer C in weight average molecular weight is preferably 5000 to 50000 more preferably 7000 to 40000. At less than 5000 the molecule is too small and the dispersion stability in a solvent due to the steric repulsion may not be improved sufficiently. At over 50000 the polymer C may associate together to lower the affinity to and thus the dispersion stability in a solvent.

The polymer C may be prepared for example by radical polymerization such as conventional solution bulk emulsion or suspension polymerization of the monomer composition in an atmosphere of or substituted with an inert gas such as nitrogen carbon dioxide or helium as necessary. The polymerization temperature is usually 0 to 100 C. and the duration of the polymerization is usually 1 to 48 hours.

The polymerization may be effected in the presence of a polymerization initiator. Examples of the polymerization initiator may include 2 2 azobis 2 amidinopropane dihydrochloride 4 4 azobis 4 cyanovaleic acid 2 2 azobis 2 5 methyl 2 imidazoline 2 yl propane dihydrochloride 2 2 azobis 2 2 imidazoline 2 yl propane dihydrochloride 2 2 azobisisobutylamide dihydrate ammonium persulfate potassium persulfate benzoyl peroxide diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate t butylperoxy 2 ethylhexanoate t butyl peroxypivalate t butyl peroxydiisobutyrate lauroyl peroxide azobisisobutylonitrile 2 2 azobis 2 4 dimethylvaleronitrile t butyl peroxyneodecanoate trade name Perbutyl ND manufactured by NOF CORPORATION and mixtures thereof. The polymerization initiator may also be various redox promoters.

The amount of the polymerization initiator is preferably 0.01 to 5.0 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the monomer composition. The obtained polymer may be purified by common purification such as re precipitation dialysis or ultrafiltration.

In the preparation of the silver nanoparticles of the present invention a solvent may suitably be used for the purpose of regulating the silver concentration or the generation speed of the silver nanoparticles. The amount of the solvent is not particularly limited and is preferably less than 3000 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the silver compound A in view of the productivity and the environmental burden.

The solvent is not particularly limited as long as the silver nanoparticles are dispersed therein and a single or a mixture of solvents may be used according to the purpose. Examples of the solvent may include methanol ethanol 1 propanol 2 propanol 1 butanol 2 butanol tert butanol 1 pentanol 2 pentanol 3 pentanol tert amylalcohol 1 hexanol 1 octanol 2 ethyl 1 hexanol ethylene glycol butoxyethanol methoxyethanol ethoxyethanol ethyl carbitol ethyl carbitol acetate butyl carbitol butyl carbitol acetate propylene glycol propylene glycol monomethyl ether propylene glycol monopropyl ether propylene glycol monobutyl ether and dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether alcohols such as terpineol ethers such as acetoxymethoxy propane phenylglycidyl ether and ethylene glycol glycidyl ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone and butyrolactone nitriles such as acetonitrile propionitrile butyronitrile and isobutyronitrile aromatics such as benzene toluene and xylene and water.

In the silver containing composition the content of the polymer C is 0.1 to 0.9 parts by mass preferably 0.2 to 0.7 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the silver elements in the silver compound A . At less than 0.1 parts by mass the silver nanoparticles though generated have low dispersion stability in a solvent and are prone to precipitation. In addition the adhesion between the substrate and the silver element obtained by heat treatment of the dispersion liquid of the present invention is insufficient. At over 0.9 parts by mass the polymer C acts as an aggregating agent to cause precipitation.

In the preparation of the silver containing composition the order of mixing the silver compound A the amine compound B and the polymer C is not particularly limited.

The silver nanoparticles according to the present invention may be obtained by the method of the present invention including reduction treatment treatment with a reducing agent or heat treatment of the silver containing composition.

The heat treatment may be pyrolytic reduction of a silver compound amine complex. The heating temperature is preferably not lower than 50 C. more preferably 70 to 200 C. The treatment time is preferably 5 to 120 minutes. At lower than 50 C. progress of the pyrolytic reduction is too slow and the silver nanoparticles are not generated whereas at over 200 C. the silver nanoparticles may be fused together.

The reducing agent may be for example formic acid hydrazine ascorbic acid hydroquinone sodium borohydride tertiary amine or amino alcohol but is not limited to these.

The amount of the reducing agent is preferably 1.0 to 5.0 mole equivalent more preferably 1.1 to 3.0 mole equivalent of the silver elements in the silver compound A of the silver containing composition. At less than 1.0 mole equivalent the amount of the reducing agent is not sufficient which causes retardation of the silver nanoparticle generation whereas at over 5.0 mole equivalent the silver nanoparticles are generated too quickly which causes aggregation and possible precipitation.

The manner of adding the reducing agent is not particularly limited and may be adjusted according to its reducing power. A reducing agent with a high reducing power may be diluted and added slowly which results in stably dispersed silver nanoparticles without precipitation. A mild reducing agent may be added at a time or the reaction may proceed by heating. The treatment with a reducing agent may usually be carried out at about room temperature.

After the completion of addition of the reducing agent the reduction reaction is terminated and the resulting liquid may preferably be stirred further for promoting coordination to the generated silver nanoparticles. Here the manner and duration of the stirring are not particularly limited.

The silver nanoparticles of the present invention has a mean volume diameter of usually 1 to 100 nm and a silver content of usually not less than 90 mass .

The silver nanoparticles of the present invention may suitably be used particularly as an electrically conductive material for forming an excellent silver element such as a silver metal film or line through heat treatment. The silver nanoparticles may thus be used for the production of a substrate having a silver element formed thereon.

The silver nanoparticles obtained by the method of the present invention may be used as obtained but preferably purified by removing excess reducing agent and amine compound not involved in the coordination to the silver nanoparticles. The purification may be carried out by precipitation in a highly polar solvent and if this does not work by centrifugation or ultrafiltration.

The dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles according to the present invention contains the silver nanoparticles of the present invention and a solvent with the silver nanoparticles being dispersed in the solvent.

The solvent is not particularly limited as long as the silver nanoparticles are dispersed therein. Examples of the solvent may include methanol ethanol 1 propanol 2 propanol 1 butanol 2 butanol tert butanol 1 pentanol 2 pentanol 3 pentanol tert amylalcohol 1 hexanol 1 octanol 2 ethyl 1 hexanol ethylene glycol butoxyethanol methoxyethanol ethoxyethanol ethyl carbitol ethyl carbitol acetate butyl carbitol butyl carbitol acetate propylene glycol propylene glycol monomethyl ether propylene glycol monopropyl ether propylene glycol monobutyl ether and dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether alcohols such as terpineol ethers such as acetoxymethoxy propane phenylglycidyl ether and ethylene glycol glycidyl ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone and butyrolactone nitriles such as acetonitrile propionitrile butyronitrile and isobutyronitrile aromatics such as benzene toluene and xylene and water.

The silver content of the dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles may suitably be selected according to the use of the dispersion and is usually preferably 10 to 85 mass and preferably 20 to 60 mass for use as an electrically conductive material in view of the low temperature sintering and dispersion stability in a solvent.

The dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles of the present invention may optionally contain as necessary for example hydrocarbon acetylene alcohol or silicon oil for adjusting the levelling property on a substrate or for example resin or a plasticizer for adjusting the viscosity characteristics of the dispersion liquid. The dispersion liquid may optionally contain further for example other electrically conductive powder glass powder surfactants metal salts and other additives generally used in a silver containing composition as necessary.

The substrate having a silver element formed thereon according to the present invention is a substrate such as a base plate having a silver element formed thereon by applying the dispersion liquid of the present invention on the substrate and heating the substrate to form silver metal into a film or line shaped silver element.

The substrate to which the dispersion liquid of the present invention is to be applied is not particularly limited as long as the dispersion liquid may be printed thereon and may be for example a plastic substrate such as of polyester polyimide epoxy resin bismaleimide triazine resin modified polyphenylene ether ABS resin polyamide polyethylene polyvinyl chloride or fluororesins a glass substrate such as of soda glass borosilicate glass silica glass or quartz glass or an interconnection substrate having metal wiring of gold silver copper aluminum or the like. The substrate may have been subjected to primer treatment plasma treatment etching treatment or solvent absorbing layer treatment.

The substrate having a silver element formed thereon may be produced using the dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles of the present invention and the substrate discussed above by for example the following methods.

The dispersion liquid of the present invention may be applied to the substrate by printing or the like method. The printing is not particularly limited and may be for example ink jet printing microgravure printing gravure offset printing screen printing roll coating air knife coating blade coating bar coating die coating or slide coating.

The temperature of the heating for forming a silver element on a substrate varies depending on the kind of the substrate and may suitably be selected. For example a heating temperature which is not higher than the heat resistance temperature of the substrate and gives a silver element with excellent electrical conductivity volume resistivity of less than 1.0 10 cm is preferred and specifically a temperature range of 100 to 200 C. is preferred. The heating time varies depending on the heating temperature so that a silver element with excellent electrical conductivity is formed and is usually 1 to 120 minutes preferably 10 to 60 minutes.

The thickness of the silver element formed on a substrate varies depending on the application and is preferably 0.2 to 50 m for use as a wiring material in view of the electrical conductivity and durability and preferably 0.5 to 30 m in view of drying and sintering in heating.

The use of the substrate having a silver element formed thereon according to the present invention is not particularly limited and is particularly useful for example in the field of electronic materials such as wiring of electronics devices in the light of its electrical conductivity represented by a volume resistivity on the order of 10 cm which is comparable to that of bulk silver and tight adhesion and durability of the silver element on the substrate.

The adhesivity was evaluated by forming 100 squares of 1 mm 1 mm each on the silver film with a cutter adhering an adhesive tape manufactured by 3M on the film peeling the tape and counting the number of the squares left. The adhesivity was graded as for 100 100 for 99 to 50 100 and x for 49 to 0 100. The results are shown in Table 7.

Using the dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles shown in Table 7 a silver film was formed on a PEN in the same way as in Example 3 1 and the electrical conductivity and the adhesivity were evaluated. The results are shown in Table 7.

Using the dispersion liquid of the silver nanoparticles shown in Table 8 a silver film was formed on a PEN in the same way as in Example 3 1 and the electrical conductivity and the adhesivity were evaluated. The results are shown in Table 8.

The results in Table 8 show that the electrical conductivity was poor and the resistance value could not be measured in Comparative Example 3 1. It is assumed to be because as silver laurate was used as a silver compound in the preparation of the silver nanoparticles residual silver laurate lauric acid or a silver laurate amine complex remained in the silver film as a nonvolatile component.

In Comparative Example 3 2 the silver film had a poor adhesivity and was easily flaked off. It is assumed that the adhesivity to the PEN substrate could not be ensured due to the absence of a polymer component in the preparation of the silver nanoparticles. This leads to the assumption that the polymers C of Examples are desorbed from the surfaces of the silver nanoparticles and are adsorbed between the nanoparticles and the substrate surface during the heating process which improves the adhesivity of the silver film to the substrate.

In Comparative Example 3 3 the resistance value was two digits higher. It is assumed to be because too much polymer component was added to cause tangling of the molecular chains which prevented the silver nanoparticles from leaving the substrate surface to remain in the silver film.
