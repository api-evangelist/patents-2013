The present invention relates to a virtual storage system. More particularly the present invention relates to a virtual storage system and methods of copying electronic documents into the virtual storage system.

Virtual storage systems have become a popular alternative for storing files thereby eliminating the need to install physical storage devices and minimizing file storage costs. A virtual storage system is an online storage system where data is stored in virtual storage pools. The pools are hosted by third parties that operate large data centers. The third parties virtualize resources in servers and present the resources as virtual storage pools for users to store files for example. The virtual storage system is accessed through a web application programming interface API a gateway or a Web based user interface UI for example. A typical virtual storage system e.g. a cloud type storage system has several disadvantages which create security concerns. For example the storage location of the files stored therein may be unknown to both third party hosting companies and or users of the virtual storage system. In addition the typical virtual storage system can be easily accessed over a communication network e.g. the Internet using simple single factor authentication processes for access thereof. The typical virtual storage system does not encrypt files that are stored on their servers which makes the files easily visible to internal employees and hackers. Further the typical virtual storage system is not Pci Compliant PCI DSS a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit credit prepaid e purse ATM and POS cards. Further once any file is stored on the virtual storage system they become property of the virtual storage system provider and are no longer user owned therefore the files can be used for other purposes such as data mining without user permission.

Online banking systems provide resources to enable users to conduct banking transactions electronically from a personal computer for example. Online banking transactions include monitoring accounts conducting money transfers applying for loans submitting loan payments etc. However users are required to visit the bank in person to conduct certain transactions such as depositing documents into a safe deposit box which is an individually secured container held in a bank vault for example. The safe deposit box is used to store valuable possessions such as jewelry currency marketable securities and important documents e.g. bank statements wills passports property deeds insurance policies photographs and birth certificates . Bank personnel typically open the bank vault with a key and a user is required to produce an assigned key to open the safe deposit box.

Currently online banking systems fail to allow users to store important documents electronically and also fail to allow users to retrieve view and share these documents electronically outside of the bank environment when desired.

The present invention obviates the above mentioned disadvantages by providing a virtual storage system that encrypts and copies electronic documents retrieved from an external system e.g. an online banking system to thereby enable a user to store important documents in a known storage location within the virtual storage system.

The present invention relates to virtual storage system and methods of selectively or automatically copying electronic documents e.g. bank statements into the virtual storage system.

Further the virtual storage system of the present invention employs a multi factor authentication process for verifying user access rights via a specifically designed application programming interface API for example that can be installed at a user computing device thereby providing a maximum security level of file storage for the user.

The virtual storage system of the present invention is also PCI Compliant following a proprietary information security standard to allow storage of cardholder information for the major debit credit prepaid e purse ATM and POS cards.

In addition the virtual storage system locks each file with encryption as it is uploaded or copied and only the user owner holds the key i.e. access rights to retrieve the file thereby leaving ownership of the file with the user owner at all times and providing extra security protection from unauthorized individuals.

The present invention provides a virtual storage system in data communication with a user computing device via a communication network which includes at least one processor configured to process encrypt and copy electronic documents retrieved from an external system and a plurality of redundant physical storage devices in data communication with the at least one processor and each configured to store the electronic documents retrieved from the external system.

Further the present invention is a method implemented by computer system to effect the copying of electronic documents into the virtual storage system in data communication via a communication network with an online document retrieval and storage system. The method includes receiving input data at the online document retrieval and storage system from a user at a computing device via a communication network requesting access to online account information selecting and viewing an electronic document of the online account information to be copied selecting a copy link within the electronic document to copy the electronic document viewing a plurality of electronic folders of the virtual storage system in a folder selection dialog selecting via the user a specific folder of the plurality of electronic folders for receiving and storing the electronic document selected encrypting the electronic document via the virtual storage system and copying the electronic document to the specific folder of the plurality of electronic folders.

Further the present invention is a method implemented by a computer system to effect the automatic copying of electronic documents into a virtual storage system in data communication via a communication network with an online document retrieval and storage system. The method includes processing an electronic document associated with a user at the online document retrieval and storage system determining whether the user has access rights to the virtual storage system encrypting the electronic document via the virtual storage system when it is determined that the user has access rights to the virtual storage system and automatically copying the electronic document to the virtual storage system.
