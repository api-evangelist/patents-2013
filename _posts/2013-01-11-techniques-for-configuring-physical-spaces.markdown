The present application is co pending with a non provisional to and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 585 309 entitled Techniques for Branch Bank Layout filed on Jan. 11 2012 the disclosure of which in its entirety is incorporated by reference herein.

Technology advancements are pervasive in modern society. Capabilities associated with processing data storing data and networking devices keep improving daily. Enterprises have taken advantage of the technology advancements along with the corresponding new consumer devices to transact track and communicate with their customers.

Most but not necessarily all of the business methodologies that enterprises use for engaging customers via technology occur while the customers are away from brick and mortar establishments of those enterprises. Moreover the methodologies that are used to engage a customer while the customer is at a brick and mortar establishment are related to conclude a transaction such as via a kiosk or kiosk type device phone of the consumer .

Very little if any enterprise uses technology to customize the physical experience that a customer has while at a brick and mortar store. This situation is less than ideal because brick and mortar stores are struggling to stay profitable in the wake of hyper competition from online stores. Most brick and mortar stores have become showcases where customers go to look and demo products which the customers subsequently buy online for a far cheaper price.

Still further service oriented brick and mortar stores are increasingly competing for the attention and loyalty of customers as more and more service oriented businesses spring up and specialize in niche areas of the market.

Enterprises have heretofore not utilized technology to enhance the physical space and utility of their brick and mortar stores. Yet improvements in this area have the potential to increase customer traffic increase customer loyalty and increase revenue generated from customers for an enterprise.

In various embodiments techniques for configuring physical spaces are presented. According to an embodiment a method for automatically configuring a physical space is provided.

Specifically an instruction is received to configure a physical space having multiple walls into a target configuration from an existing configuration. Next devices associated with the walls are directed to move selective walls along tracks to achieve the target configuration. Finally media devices embedded in or affixed to portions of selective walls are directed to present custom information consistent with the target configuration.

The space configuration manager executes on one or more processors. The processors may be distributed over a network to interact with devices within a specific geographical location. In an embodiment the processors are at least partially accessible via a cloud or server based environment.

At the space configuration manager receives an instruction to configure a physical space having multiple walls into a target configuration from an existing source configuration. That is the instruction is a series of sub instructions defining the order and timing of wall movements to achieve the desired target configuration. The walls are sectioned and fit together or can exist independent of one another and move via hinges in the walls and tracks. The tracks can be lined discretely along the floor and or can exist along the ceiling. The hinges and the walls include devices that are integrated into or coupled to the hinges and the walls to process the sub instructions and to physically move the hinges and the walls to the target configuration.

In an embodiment the physical space is associated with a branch bank and the target configuration is a desired layout for the branch bank at a specific time of day occurring on a specific calendar date.

The instruction for causing the physical space to be reconfigured automatically without manual intervention can be received in a variety of manners.

For example in one case at the space configuration manager obtains the instruction from an automated agent that triggers the instruction based on a specific event and or specific date and time. In other words the automated agent is configured to send the space configuration manager the instruction to cause the desired configuration based on some predefined event promotion calendar date time of day etc. .

In another case at the space configuration manager obtains the instruction via user that is interacting with a graphical user interface GUI acting as a front end to the space configuration manager. Here the user defines the target configuration from scratch. So the user can process the GUI to custom define the physical space by defining the target configuration and causing the target configuration to be sent to the space configuration manager.

In yet another situation at the space configuration manager obtains the instruction from the user via a GUI but here the user selects the target configuration from a list of available configurations.

Continuing with the embodiment of and at the space configuration manager acquires the target configuration as a modification made by the user to a selected configuration from the list.

So based on the space configuration manager can receive the instruction for the target from an automated agent or from a user. The user custom defines the target configuration selects it from a predefined list or modifies it from a selection made from the list.

At the space configuration manager directs devices associated with the walls to move selective walls or portions of walls along tracks and or hinges to achieve the desired target configuration within the physical space.

At the space configuration manager instructs media devices embedded in or affixed to portions of selective walls to present custom information consistent with the target configuration. In an embodiment the media devices include tablets laptops desktops televisions money stations other kiosks and the like. Again the media devices are embedded or affixed to the walls.

According to an embodiment at the space configuration manager initiates selective services that are interactively available to consumers via the media devices as defined by the target configuration. So tablets or laptops are loaded with services that consumers can interactively use based on the target configuration.

Continuing with the embodiment of and at the space configuration manager configures the media devices for security restrictions with respect to the selective services based on the target configuration. Here only limited features of the services and only the defined services are accessible to the consumers on the media devices for security reasons.

In an embodiment at the space configuration manager configures each media device to present different information from remaining ones of the media devices. So one media device may be playing a video while another offers kiosk services and still another displays an advertisement. In some cases the information can fit together so one media device presents one aspect of an ad while another presents another portion of that ad.

According to an embodiment at the space configuration manager adjusts lighting associated with the target configuration within the physical space. Temperature can be adjusted as well.

Continuing with the embodiment of and at the space configuration manager initiates audio selections associated with the target configuration within the physical space. This can be informational audio or background music.

Still continuing with the embodiment of and at the space configuration manager alters blinds associated with the target configuration the blinds appearing on selectively outwardly facing windows of the physical space. So during different times of the year and for a given time of day the window blinds are automatically adjusted. It is noted that the walls may have windows with blinds as well and based on the target configuration can be closed to provide privacy within a sub room associated with the target configuration.

The space controller presents another and in some ways enhanced processing perspective of the space configuration manager represented by the method and discussed above with reference to the .

At the space controller instructs devices that control walls of a physical space to reconfigure from a source state to a target space. Again the walls or some select walls move along tracks that can be hung on the floor and or the ceiling of the physical space. Devices integrated into the walls or engaged with the walls are directed to move the walls to the target space. The timing and order of the movements are controlled based on the source state and the desired target space. Moreover some walls can be bent to form tables or archways and other structures along hinges. In such cases these hinges include devices receptive to the instructions of the space controller to achieve the desired configuration.

In an embodiment at the space controller obtains the target state via a front end interface that communicates with the space controller over a network connection can be WiFi cellular Bluetooth Radio Frequency Near Field Communication NFC Ethernet and others .

Continuing with the embodiment of and at the space controller provides the front end interface as an Application Programming Interface API . This permits automated services to define the target state and to decide when and under what conditions the instruction to move from the source state to the target state is sent to the space controller.

In another instance of and at the space controller provides the front end interface as a mobile device app. So an administrator or employee of an enterprise can have an app on a tablet or phone that defines the target state and sends the target state instruction for transition from the source state to the space controller. Obviously security is enforced in such a scenario to prevent chaos with unauthorized requests to reconfigure the physical space.

In yet another circumstance of and at the space controller provides the front end interface as a GUI which an authorized user can access via any processing device to define the target state and initiate the instruction to transition from the source state to the target state the instruction sent to the space controller.

According to an embodiment at the space controller identifies the target state based on a specific business using the physical space on a specific calendar date and at a specific time of day.

At the space controller configures media devices within the physical space to a media state that is consistent with the target state. Such a situation was discussed above with reference to the .

The automated physical space configuration system includes a one or more processors having memory and or non transitory computer readable media programmed with executable instructions that represent the space configuration manager . The space configuration manager is also operational over a network which is wired wireless or a combination of wired and wireless. Example processing associated with the space configuration manager was presented above in detail with reference to the space configuration manager and space controller respectively .

The space configuration manager is configured to interact with devices that control physical space within a building to custom and to automatically redefine that physical space.

According to an embodiment the space configuration manager is further configured to interact with other devices that control physical attributes of the physical space to automatically adjust those physical attributes.

Continuing with the previous embodiment and in some situations the physical attributes include one or more of configurations of media devices located throughout the physical space lighting within the physical space temperature settings within the physical space audio selections within the physical space and blind adjustments from blinds on windows within the physical space.
