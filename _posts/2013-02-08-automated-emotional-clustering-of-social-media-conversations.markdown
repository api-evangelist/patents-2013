This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 596 481 filed Feb. 8 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

With the rising popularity of social media e.g. Twitter Facebook blogs marketers and brand managers have become increasingly interested in understanding and monitoring how consumers perceive their brands and products through analyzing social media conversations. Given the massive amount of social media conversations e.g. users post around 400 million short messages on Twitter per day an automated methodology is needed to efficiently analyze and make sense of the content in social media conversations.

Current methods of analyzing social media conversations do not provide an automated system. With current technologies the system requires an analyst to systematically code up a portion of social media conversation as training data before that method can provide any meaningful output.

The instant invention relates to a method and system for using methodological framework that allows one to automatically categorize and summarize the expressed emotions in social chatter by using a knowledge base of emotional words phrases as an input to define a distance metric between conversations and then conduct hierarchical clustering based on that distance metric.

An important feature of the present inventive subject matter as an unsupervised emotional clustering algorithm based method and system is the ability to categorize the different kinds of emotions in social media conversation automatically without the need of any human intervention. This is fundamentally different from current approaches which either rely partially on human input or provide analysis only at the simple word count level.

One advantage of completion automation is to eliminate costly and time consuming work by a human analyst. Another advantage is that an automated system can be readily scaled. Another advantage is that scaling allows a system to handle data from various domains. Another advantage is that using data from various domains allows marketers to analyze social media content more efficiently. Another advantage is that an automated system avoids subject input from a human analyst obtaining a large degree of objectivity in the data set and conclusions.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a knowledge base is constructed. In this embodiment the knowledge base comprises a database of emotional tokens and a pairwise distance between all of the major tokens and a subset of the minor tokens determination of major minor based on incidence in a sample . Raw data representing social media communications is obtained from a social media provider.

For a computer program to understand whether a certain word phrase expresses emotions an external knowledge base of emotional word phrases is necessary Manning and Schuetze 1999 . The quality of the information contained in such knowledge base directly drives the performance of our emotional categorization system Manning and Schuetze 1999 .

In some embodiments the platforms systems media and methods described herein include a knowledge base or use of the same. In further embodiments a knowledge base comprises a list of emotional tokens and pairwise token distance.

In particular embodiments a knowledge base K for emotional categorization is comprised of two key components K V D. First an exhaustive list of all emotional tokens under consideration is provided. In various embodiments a token can be a single word e.g. amazing a phrase e.g. not blow away or a collection of words that carries a specific emotion e.g. so far pretty good . In a particular embodiment this list is denoted as V v v . . . v where vis an emotional token and n denotes the total number of emotional tokens considered. Thus such a knowledge base allows the computer program to tag each communication based on the existence of emotional tokens in the communication. Note that n can be a very large number thus the construction of such knowledge bases may be extremely costly. However recent success to construct a large lexical database for English see e.g. the WordNet database described in Fellbaum 2005 shows that such a task is possible albeit time consuming.

In some embodiments the platforms systems media and methods described herein include a database of tokens or use of the same. A database of tokens described herein has many suitable sizes. In various embodiments a database of tokens described herein includes about 50 about 100 about 200 about 300 about 400 about 500 about 600 about 700 about 800 about 900 about 1000 or more tokens. In further various embodiments a database of tokens described herein includes about 1000 about 2000 about 3000 about 4000 about 5000 about 6000 about 7000 about 8000 about 9000 about 10000 or more tokens. In various embodiments a database of tokens described herein includes at least 50 at least 100 at least 200 at least 300 at least 400 at least 500 at least 600 at least 700 at least 800 at least 900 at least 1000 at least 2000 at least 3000 at least 4000 at least 5000 at least 6000 at least 7000 at least 8000 at least 9000 at least 10000 or more tokens.

In some embodiments tokens are identified manually by one or more analysts. In some embodiments tokens in a database of tokens are ranked scored or rated based on incidence in a calibration sample. In a further embodiment tokens in a database of tokens are ranked into two or more groups based on incidence. In a particular embodiment tokens are ranked as major or minor tokens. In some embodiments tokens are associated with equivalents. In further embodiments token equivalents include by way of non limiting examples synonyms misspellings slang abbreviations foreign language alternatives and the like.

In some embodiments a database of tokens is language specific and intended for analysis of social media communications expressed in a particular language or group of related similar languages. Many languages are suitable. In various embodiments suitable languages include by way of non limiting examples English Spanish Italian Portuguese French Dutch Polish German Russian Ukrainian Mandarin Wu Cantonese Hindi Punjabi Bengali Marathi Urdu Arabic Turkish Tamil Farsi Japanese Korean Vietnamese Thai Burmese Malay Telugu Javanese and Tagalog. In a particular embodiment the tokens are English tokens.

In some embodiments a database of tokens is domain specific and intended for analysis of social media communications pertaining to a particular subject matter. Many domains are suitable. Any domain for which consumers express sentiment in social media is suitable. In various embodiments suitable domains include by way of non limiting examples entertainment e.g. movies television books magazines music video games etc. sports e.g. college professional Olympic etc. fashion travel politics e.g. local state national etc. news technology shopping and the like.

In some embodiments one or more tokens in a database of tokens are assigned an arousal score. In some embodiments all of the tokens in a database of tokens are assigned an arousal score. In further embodiments an arousal score represents the degree of emotional activation or deactivation expressed by the token. Many scoring rating or ranking regimes are suitable including by way of non limiting examples numeric scores letter grades and the like.

In some embodiments one or more tokens in a database of tokens are assigned a valence score. In some embodiments all of the tokens in a database of tokens are assigned a valence score. In further embodiments a valence score represents the degree of positivity or negativity expressed by the token. Many scoring rating or ranking regimes are suitable including by way of non limiting examples numeric scores letter grades and the like.

In further particular embodiments the second component of the knowledge base is a specification of the pairwise similarity between any two emotional tokens. This allows a computer system to later compute an emotional similarity between any two social media communications a pre requisite for a full hierarchical clustering of communications based on their emotional content Johnson and Wichern 2007 .

In some embodiments the platforms systems media and methods described herein include a software module for building and maintaining a matrix of pairwise relationships between pairs of tokens or use of the same. In some embodiments a matrix of pairwise relationships between tokens described herein includes every possible pair of tokens available in a database of tokens. In other embodiments a matrix of pairwise relationships between tokens described herein includes a subset of the possible pairs of tokens available in a database of tokens.

In some embodiments each pairwise relationship between tokens in a matrix of relationships includes a degree of similarity for each token pair. In further embodiments a degree of similarity spans a range from positive similarity to negative similarity e.g. dissimilarity . In still further embodiments a degree of similarity is expressed on a scale. Many scales are suitable including by way of non limiting examples numeric scales letter grades qualitative scales and the like.

In some embodiments a matrix of pairwise relationships between tokens described herein is generated manually by one or more analysts. In some embodiments each pairwise relationship in the matrix of relationships including the degree of similarity is validated by one or more additional analysts. In further embodiments validation is performed by voting. In still further embodiments validation is performed by voting agree or disagree with each configured token relationship.

In certain embodiments pairwise similarity between any two tokens s is rated on a scale of 3 strongly opposite 2 moderately opposite 1 weakly opposite 0 no relationship 1 weakly synonymous 2 moderately synonymous and 3 strongly synonymous . For example the pairwise similarity between dull and fascinated is 3 the pairwise similarity between fantastic and exquisite is 3. Based on this pairwise similarity we define a symmetric distance matrix D where 4 Formula 1

with the diagonal entires of D equals 0. Thus in this embodiment the distance between any two tokens ranges from 0 to 7 distance 0 if two tokens are the same and distance 7 if the two tokens carry strongly opposite emotions.

In some embodiments social media communications are classified as either emotional or non emotional communications. Given the knowledge base of emotional tokens K in light of the disclosure provided herein it is straightforward to determine whether a social media communication carries emotions or not. The collection of communications is denoted as x k 1 2 . . . K . For any communication the words contained in the communications are compared with the set of emotional tokens V . Formally each communication xis represented by the set of tokens that belong in V which we denote by the vector right arrow over z . The absence of any emotional tokens in a communication i.e. right arrow over z put the communication into the communications with no emotions category. The remaining communications which are classified as communications with emotions are then clustered based on their emotional content using the methodology discussed herein.

In some embodiments expressed emotions are categorized. In order to cluster communications based on their emotional content a distance metric is first defined between any two communications which may contain a different number of emotional tokens. For ease of exposition two communications are denoted as xand x and the distance function between them is denoted as d x x . Provided herein is the definition of d x x and examples to illustrate the distance metric. Also provided herein is a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm based on d x x 

In some embodiments a distance metric utilizes an expand align compare EAC algorithm. Given that xand xmay contain a different number of emotional tokens the following expand align compare EAC algorithm is utilized to define the distance between any two communications which are now summarized by their respective collections of emotional tokens. The intuition of the described approach is as follows. First if the two sequences of emotional tokens extracted from the two communications respectively differ in length the shorter sequence is expanded by making replicates of itself to match the length of the longer sequence. Next the two sequences now of equal lengths are aligned i.e. the emotional tokens are ordered so that they are maximally similar to each other in each position. Finally the emotional tokens in each position are compared based on the pairwise token distance D defined in the knowledge base described herein and the distance between two communications is taken as the average of all the pairwise token distances.

The EAC algorithm is formally defined as follows. As discussed the sequence of emotional tokens extracted from communication xand communication xare denoted as right arrow over z and right arrow over z respectively. Without loss of generality we assume that the length of the sequence right arrow over z henceforth denoted as right arrow over z is shorter or equal to the length of right arrow over z . Alternatively one computes d x x instead assuming that the distance metric is symmetric. It is denoted that tilde over z t 1 2 . . . T as the expanded versions of right arrow over z by making replicates of itself to matches the length of right arrow over z . Thus if right arrow over z is a multiple of right arrow over z e.g. right arrow over z a b right arrow over z c d e f and there should only be one version of tilde over z a b a b in this example hence T 1. Otherwise if right arrow over z is a not multiple of right arrow over z e.g. right arrow over z a b right arrow over z c d e tilde over z should carry more than one expanded version a b a or a b b . In general if we let q floor right arrow over z right arrow over z there should be T C versions of tilde over z to represent all the possible expansions of right arrow over z .

Next the distance metric between communication xand communication xis defined as the average aligned distance defined later between tilde over z and right arrow over z . That is 

where d right arrow over z right arrow over z denotes the aligned distance between the sequence of emotional tokens right arrow over z and right arrow over z which are assumed to be equal in length . d right arrow over z right arrow over z can be computed by looking at every possible permutation of right arrow over z and selecting the one that has the smallest average pairwise distance with right arrow over z . Formally we define 

where right arrow over z denotes a permuted version of right arrow over z and z denotes the i th element of right arrow over z . Thus Formula 2 and Formula 3 fully define an emotional distance metric between any two communications which may consist of different number of emotional tokens.

In some embodiments communications are hierarchically clustered. Given the definition of an emotional distance metric clustering communications based on their emotions is straightforward and can be done using a variety of standard clustering algorithms e.g. John and Wichern 2007 . Here we outline the procedure of agglomerative hierarchical clustering with average linkage it is clear that other clustering methods e.g. k means clustering k mediod clustering can be directly applied here as well.

In some embodiments the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm produces a series of partitions of the data using the following steps please refer to Johnson and Wichern 2007 for details 

 2 At each particular stage we join together the two clusters which are most similar where distance between any two cluster A and B are measured by

where a b denotes elements of cluster A and B respectively and A and B denotes the number of elements in cluster A and B respectively.

In some embodiments the platforms systems media and methods described herein include a software module for providing a visualization of sentiment clusters or use of the same. In further embodiments a software module for providing a visualization of sentiment clusters is part of a customer dashboard application and provides customers of a social intelligence service to monitor sentiment expressed in social media for any particular topic.

In some embodiments a visualization of sentiment clusters described herein is a textual visualization. In other embodiments a visualization of sentiment clusters described herein is a graphical visualization. Many graphic visualization formats are suitable. In various embodiments suitable graphic visualization formats include by way of non limiting examples charts graphs maps diagrams and the like.

In some embodiments the individual elements of a graphic visualization represent sentiment clusters for a topic. In further embodiments an individual element indicates the magnitude e.g. number of communications in the cluster etc. of a sentiment cluster. In further embodiments an individual element indicates the arousal e.g. degree of emotional activation or deactivation associated with a sentiment cluster. In further embodiments an individual element indicates the valence e.g. degree of positively or negativity associated with a sentiment cluster. In some embodiments an individual element indicates one or more representative social media communications associated with a sentiment cluster.

In some embodiments the visualization is hierarchical indicating the relationships between sentiment clusters. In some embodiments the visualization is interactive. In further embodiments interactivity is utilized to allow a customer to expand and or collapse hierarchies of sentiment clusters in order to get different views of the data contained therein. In further embodiments interactivity is utilized to allow a customer to move manipulate tag label or organize sentiment clusters in order to make better use of the data contained therein. In some embodiments clusters are optionally interacted with to provide one or more social media communications representative of those in the cluster.

In some embodiments a graphic visualization of sentiment clusters described herein is two dimensional. In other embodiments a graphic visualization of sentiment clusters described herein is three dimensional.

Referring to in a particular embodiment an overall social media intelligence monitoring process includes three phases 1 construction of a knowledge base 2 use of the knowledge base to evaluate the sentiments of social media communications and 3 clustering of communications to provide a summary for a customer. In this embodiment a group of analysts uses a large sample of social media communications pertaining to a particular topic to identify a set of domain specific emotional tokens e.g. words or phrases expressing sentiment emotion etc. . The analysts further identify equivalents for each token . Optionally the tokens are ranked based on their frequency of incidence in the sample of communications i.e. into major and minor groups . Further in this embodiment each token is assigned a valence score and an arousal score to qualify the expressed emotion in terms of strength and direction.

Continuing to refer to in a particular embodiment the analysts then manually rate the similarity of each possible pair of tokens to create a pairwise token distance . These configurations are calibrated by evaluating a sample of social media communications for each token. For each sample communication the valence and arousal is rated and evaluated. Finally the knowledge based is completed by fusing the pairwise distancing data and the calibration data with a data fusion algorithm . This procedure refines the matrix of pairwise tokens distances through a signal processing approach and at the same time approximates missing entries.

Continuing to refer to in a particular embodiment the completed knowledge base is utilized in an iterative process to evaluate the expressed emotions in a plurality of social media communications in order to create a clustered summary of expressed emotions. In this embodiment for each communication the emotional tokens are identified . It should be noted that a single communication in various cases includes none one or a plurality of tokens. Further in this embodiment using the valence and arousal scores of each token in the knowledge base each communication is assigned a valence score and an arousal score . Given the pairwise distance between tokens in the knowledge base an algorithm is applied to compute the pairwise distance between communications in the data set. Next given the pairwise distance between communications a clustering algorithm is applied to cluster the communications into different emotional clusters . The number of clusters is dynamically determined. Last a visual summary of sentiment clusters is generated in a graphical format and presented to a customer via a dashboard application.

The following illustrative examples are representative of embodiments of the software applications systems and methods described herein and are not meant to be limiting in any way. Described herein are five examples to further illustrate suitable distance metrics. Note that in the examples below a b c d e f denotes six different emotional tokens in V i.e. a b c d e f V.

In this case clearly d x x D a b . Since each communication contains only a single emotional token the expand or align steps of the EAC algorithm described herein are not necessary.

To compute d x x we first expand right arrow over z a to match the length of right arrow over z . Because right arrow over z is a multiple of right arrow over z we have T 1 and tilde over z a a a. Thus we have

Here right arrow over z and right arrow over z have the same length so the expand step is not needed. To compute the aligned distance we consider the two possible orderings of right arrow over z c d and d c and take the ordering that gives the smallest distance with right arrow over z . Thus we have

In this case both the expand and align steps of the EAC algorithm described herein are needed. We first expand right arrow over z a b to match the length of right arrow over z . Because z is a multiple of right arrow over z we have T 1 and tilde over z a b a b. Next we consider all possible ordering of right arrow over z . Because right arrow over z 4 there are a total of 4 24 permutations 

d x x can then be computed by computing each of the distance of the 24 permutations of with right arrow over z with tilde over z and taking the minimum of those distances.

Finally consider the case where right arrow over z is not an exact multiple of right arrow over z . In this case we need to consider two possible expansions of right arrow over z a b. That is T 2 with tilde over z a b a and tilde over z a b b. Then we consider the 6 possible permutations of right arrow over z c d e c e d d c e d e c e c d and e d c.
