With the growth of technology individuals today are more connected than they ever before. It is common for a single individual to carry one or more mobile devices at any time. However with multiple devices there are challenges when users are interacting with one another. One such challenge occurs when users are submitting information to each other.

There is a growing need to send documents via mobile device and between mobile devices and their users but current solutions are often not as capable as desired. Current solutions include portable storage solutions and Bump offered by Bump Technologies Mountain View Calif. . It is not feasible for users to carry a portable storage device at all times. Although users can send emails they cannot easily refer to previously sent or received information seamlessly. Emails may be lost or become hard to find or track. There are no APIs to build on top of emails for automation. Additionally when individuals are in a face to face professional or corporate setting none of these solutions are viable solutions. Individuals might not wish to Bump phones in a corporate setting.

Current solutions are further limited in their ability to instantly share documents and comments among users. For example Recsolu provides recruiting software to universities. The software aids with management of resumes and organization of career fairs etc. but does not provide instant transfer of resumes or other documents in real time from any device to any device between users. There is latency in the Recsolu system because a recruiter must first scan the applicant s QR code when the applicant is in front of the recruiter the QR code is then forwarded to the server over the internet and the server processes the QR code and then sends the applicant s profile which then allows the recruiter to view the applicant s profile. The resume or profile information cannot be sent in advance to the particular recruiter by the applicant.

There is a need for a system and method for real time collaborative document review and transfer including the use of mobile devices.

Embodiments of a method and system for secure real time collaborative document review and transfer are described. Embodiments enable users to send data and documents with full transparency and on any device. In addition users can quickly provide comments on documents and the comments are stored with the documents in a database accessible to a selected group of users who each can review and comment on the data. For purposes of illustration and not limitation aspects of the invention will be described as a method and system for job applicants and job recruiters. However the invention is applicable to other particular environments. The examples used for illustration demonstrate the advantages of instantly communicating data and storing data including real time observations. The environment of a career fair with hundreds of applicants and hundreds of employers lends itself to a solution for the problem of having a very large amount of data to review in a short period of time combined with the goal of having human interaction and making notes on the interaction for later review. Therefore the career fair environment is used as an example of a use that embodiments of the invention are appropriate for. However embodiments are not limited to career fairs or job seeking scenarios.

In this document a service called Mounza will be used as an example of embodiments of the invention. The service provides each person wishing to transfer receive or send data via the service with a unique identification ID for transferring data. In an example embodiment as described herein the person can be a job recruiter. The unique ID can be alphanumeric graphic or any electronic format that uniquely identifies the individual receiving sending the data. The ID can be an email address a company name plus a recruiter number a job ID plus a recruiter number a photo of the recruiter etc. When a sender is trying to send data to a receiver the receiver s ID must be provided. The service performs the data transfers on the back end and the receiver receives a notification that the data is received. The notification is received on any and all supported electronic communication devices. Herein the terms data and document are used interchangeably but the data is not limited to a text document or other particular form of data. Examples of files types supported include without limitation .jpg .gif .png .tiff. The service and system as described herein includes necessary software for platform support on individual devices.

According to some embodiments location based services LBS are used to allow recruiters and students to detect each other s proximity. In such an embodiment a student does not need to enter a recruiter ID but can see which recruiters are near at a particular time and send information to selected ones of the recruiters in proximity. In addition students can send resumes and other information to other students for critique and comments.

Once received the document can be viewed on any device. Documents can be downloaded and transferred in any way. The received version is stored on a Mounza server. This allows the receiver and other users to view the document on any and all devices.

Additionally Mounza provides a set of application programming interfaces APIs for automation. For example a user can submit a resume to a recruiter at a career fair and that resume is automatically submitted into the recruitment platform at the organization the recruiter is representing. Previously this would have required digitizing the applicant s paper resume for submission a manual process.

On the right side of the diagram two recruiter screens are shown. In the View screen the student s resume appears as soon as the student presses the SEND button. The student sets the status to be displayed on this page. Status options include available right now Idle and Not Available . The recruiter can SMS the student by pressing the SMS button or call the student by pressing the CALL button. The contact information entered by the student when signing up for Mounza is accessed for these features. The recruiter has the ability ahead of time to create tags appropriate to the company s interest. In this example the company has identified three qualities that can be tagged strong communicator and contact . This allows the recruiter to quickly describe the candidate including the intangibles most important to the firm by clicking on one all or none of the tags. The recruiter can highlight the text of the resume as shown.

When receiving a document recruiters will see an alert on their mobile application. The recruiter can open the document within the application as shown in and view the student s resume. The recruiter screen includes a Home button a Resume drop button a Chat button and a Register button which will all be described more fully below. As shown in once the recruiter has reviewed the resume he or she can play a resume classification game to classify the resume as a Yes a No or a Maybe for each of multiple jobs the recruiter is looking to fill.

A recruiter web site screen is shown in . The recruiter also has a profile button to allow review and update of a profile. There is a resume drop button to view the list of jobs the company is recruiting for. Once selecting the job the recruiter will see the yes maybe no classification of the selected job. By classifying the student s application when received recruiters save time when trying to identify potential hires. There are also Inbox and Sent buttons for viewing messages. This screen shows a collaborative session between the recruiter and their decision making colleagues. The resume is viewed by all of the collaborators in real time. This screen lets recruiters see the resumes for a particular job opening that are in the yes maybe or no buckets. After collaboration if needed recruiters may re classify a specific resume in another bucket. The Yes bucket is the list of candidates that should be interviewed. The Maybe bucket is the list of candidates that should be interviewed if there is an interview slot open. The No bucket is the list of candidates that the firm will not interview. The All bucket is a list of all resumes received for the particular job. If desired the microphone button allows the recruiter to replay a recording of the face to face interview with the student. At the bottom of the screen is a record of live chat where typed communications among the collaborators appear. The classification names and the number of classifications are configurable by the recruiter. These classifications are shown as an example.

Students are busy and social driven so a solution as described herein provides a time saving and friendly way to organize the job hunt and also share information with other students. Students can share resumes and recommendations. They can share job opportunities with other students and critique other student s resumes. The instant access to recruiter information and company and career fair information makes planning for the career search easier during an extremely hectic time.

Embodiments of the invention provide a durable professional network for student and recent alumni. In addition relationships between professors and students are enhanced. Students look to alumni and professors for help and the invention allows a central meeting place and a way to centrally share data. This is particularly helpful in today s environment where young professional change jobs often. The network allows ongoing support for job seekers such as periodic reports of job seeker statistics. Recruiters can make themselves and their companies more visible with very current information helping the right resume go to the right recruiter the first time. In an embodiment APIs allow corporate recruiter to integrate embodiments of the invention into existing hiring tools. The invention allows for tracking of success. For example students will almost always provide their updated status to LinkedIn Integration with LinkedIn allows collection of data on students and alumni who are hired for various jobs over time.

In an embodiment the system includes an analytics engine not shown that analyzes data items from the documents and their contexts and produces various statistical data for users. For example some statistics students are interested in include the following 

A recruiter user can give his or her ID to a student as previously described . The recruiter then receives a resume from the student . The recruiter then critiques and rates the student applicant and their resume . The recruiter can then save the resume and submit it for further review all from the Mounza service mobile application.

These statistics are merely examples of types of information that can be generated and are not meant to be exclusive.

Embodiments of the invention include a business method for using network data. Embodiments of the Mounza network as described herein enable highly focused data to be collected and organized. As illustrated by the data includes details about each student for example the data can include college location graduation date degree s obtained hobbies eventual job type and location etc. This data can be sold to entities wishing goods or services to students. Detailed custom reports are generated according to an embodiment at the request of entities. The entities are then given access to the network to provide targeted advertising to students and also to recruiters and professors . The embodiment also includes providing employers a platform to communicate with students based on particular interests.

Various embodiments have been described by way of example but examples not explicitly described are also within the scope of the invention. For example in embodiments the recruiter application is configurable by the recruiter in many ways. Recruiters can categorize and search among data in any desired way. For example for each new job opportunity at the recruiter s company the recruiter is asked which schools will show the job as open. When searching for candidates at a later time the pool of candidates will be broken down into the schools and the jobs applied for. Recruiters can choose to see all candidates that did well across all of the schools for example or perhaps just see all of the yes and maybe candidates.
