title: Disaster recovery service
abstract: A customer may use a disaster recovery service to generate a disaster recovery scenario in order to make certain resources available to the customer in the event of a data region failure. The customer may specify a recovery point objective, a recovery time objective and a recovery data region for the scenario. Accordingly, the disaster recovery service may coordinate with one or more other services provided by the computing resource service provider to reproduce the customer resources and other resources necessary to support the customer resources. These reproduced resources may be transferred to the recovery data region based at least in part on the parameters specified by the customer. In the event of a data region failure, the disaster recovery service may update the domain name system to resolve any customer requests for the customer resources to the recovery data region.

Computing resource service providers and other service providers often grant users access to one or more services to support the users business needs. These services may be maintained and operated in multiple data regions enabling users to select a data region for accessing these services which may potentially reduce latency and provide higher throughput to each user of these services. Despite their many advantages the use of these data regions may present some risks that are borne by the computing resource service provider and the organizations that utilize them. For example despite their best efforts to avoid it these data regions may be susceptible to natural disasters and other events that can cause failures that may result in significant downtime and data loss. Currently the organizations that utilize these services through a data region utilize various tools and mechanisms for disaster recovery scenarios. For instance these organizations may duplicate their data manually to a number of data regions in order to have adequate redundancy in the event of a data region failure. Generally the management and execution of adequate failover plans can be complex and as a result difficult to manage.

In the following description various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

Techniques described and suggested herein relate to a disaster recovery service provided by a computing resource service provider where the disaster recovery service coordinates various computing resource services to prepare a failover and failover itself from one region to another thereby providing continued availability of computing resources provided by one or more services in the event of a data region failure. In an embodiment an entity e.g. an organization may communicate with a disaster recovery service such as through one or more appropriately configured application programming interface API calls to the service to request creation of a disaster recovery scenario that may for example be utilized to restore availability of data that may have become unavailable as a result of a failure at a data region. The entity may be a customer of a computing resource service provider that operates various services such as a virtual computer system service object based data storage services database services the aforementioned disaster recovery service and a plurality of other services.

When a disaster recovery scenario is created the disaster recovery service may coordinate preparation for failover by at least in part transmitting one or more executable instructions to the appropriate services specified by the entity to initiate a replication process. In some embodiments the disaster recovery scenario includes a recovery point objective RPO period and a recovery time objective RTO period for resumption of data availability in an alternative data region after a failure in the original data region comprising customer data. The disaster recovery service may be configured to transmit executable instructions to the various services that the customer may be utilizing to replicate and transmit the customer data to an alternative data region in accordance with the specified RPO and RTO. For instance the executable instructions may cause the various services to perform an initial replication of the computing resources used by the customer and at a later time update the replication process such that in the event of a data region failure the failover process may be able to occur in accordance with the RPO and RTO. Such replication and maintenance of resources may be performed such that the replicated resources maintain any dependencies from one another consistent with the resources that are replicated.

In some embodiments an entity interfaces with the disaster recovery service through a graphical user interface GUI configured to transmit one or more appropriately configured API calls to the service to specify the parameters for the disaster recovery scenario. For instance an entity may use the GUI to specify the RPO RTO and alternative data region to be utilized in the event of a failure. Additionally the entity may interface with the disaster recovery service through a GUI to specify the one or more resources that are to be replicated and redundantly stored within the alternative data region specified. If the entity provides valid entries for the RPO RTO alternative data region and resources that are to be the bases for the disaster recovery scenario a management sub system within the disaster recovery service may be configured to use these entries to generate and transmit the executable instructions noted above to the applicable services specified by the entity. Other parameters for a disaster recovery scenario include various parameters specifying various relationships e.g. resource dependencies among resources so that such relationships are preserved in the case of failover.

In various embodiments once the disaster recovery scenario has been created the disaster recovery service is configured to allow an entity to test the scenario to ensure that the implementation of the scenario is adequate. For instance the entity may interact with the disaster recovery service through the GUI to transmit one or more appropriately configured API calls to the service to initialize a failover test. Accordingly the disaster recovery service may be configured to access the alternative data region specified during the creation of the scenario and modify any entity requests to access the various services provided by the computing resource service provider such that the requests are addressed to this alternative data region. This may allow the entity to access the replicated data in this alternative data region. Additionally the entity may initiate a failover test to ensure that the reproduced data is available in the event of a failover event. The disaster recovery service may be configured to track any relevant metrics in order to verify that the failover has been performed successfully according to the entity specifications for the scenario.

In an embodiment the disaster recovery service is operated and maintained in an objective data region apart from the original data region comprising the entity data and from the alternative data region used for replication of the entity data. For instance the disaster recovery service may be configured to interact with the applicable services in the original data region to transmit one or more executable instructions to these services to replicate the entity resources and transfer these replicated resources to an alternative data region. Additionally the disaster recovery service may be configured to interact with the alternative data region to verify that the replicated resources are available and to test the failover upon entity request. This may prevent the disaster recovery service from interfering with the operations necessary to failover from the original region to the alternate region. Thus the disaster recovery service may be configured to act as a witness to the operations taking place tracking these operations and providing updates and metrics to the entity.

In an embodiment the disaster recovery service is configured to coordinate the failover of any disparate resources to the alternative data region in order to preserve dependencies among the entity data. For instance the disaster recovery service may coordinate the various services for each entity to ensure that upon failover the transferred resources are available with minimal interruption. For example the disaster recovery service may be configured to transmit a set of executable instructions to an object based data storage service that may cause the service to replicate and transfer one or more logical data containers to the alternative data region prior to replication and transfer of a virtual machine instance which may rely on the one or more logical data containers to the alternative data region. This may allow the entity to utilize the replicated instance in this alternative data region upon a failure event.

In this manner an entity may be able to create a disaster recovery scenario that may be used to restore the entity s data and services necessary to support its business needs. In addition the techniques described and suggested herein facilitate additional technical advantages. For example because the creation of the disaster recovery scenario may include coordinating one or more resources in the alternative data region this may enable the services on the alternative data region to have the resources necessary to successfully implement the failover according to the entity s existing service and resource configurations. This in turn may reduce the potential downtime resulting from a data region failure and enable the disaster recovery service to more efficiently comply with the entity specified RPO and RTO time periods.

These services may be hosted in multiple locations worldwide in order to support a variety of customers that may want to operate these services from varied locations. Each location may comprise a number of data regions and one or more data zones. A data zone may be an independent section of a data center that may add redundancy and fault tolerance to a particular location. Each data region may comprise one or more partitions of the data zones which may be used to further allocate resources to the customers utilizing one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. For instance a customer or other entity may be able to access these data zones through the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. For example a customer may use a customer interface to access a virtual machine instance hosted in a particular data zone. Alternatively a computing resource or customer application may be configured to communicate with the customer interface in order to access these data zones on the customer s behalf.

Accordingly as illustrated in the environment includes a number of data regions configured to provide one or more services to customers in a variety of geographic locations. In the environment a customer of the computing resource service provider may interact with an original data region provided by the computing resource service provider to utilize one or more services. For example the customer may interact with an object based data storage service to generate one or more logical data containers for the persistent storage of data. Accordingly the customer may maintain critical or sensitive data within the original data region that may be difficult to reconstruct or recover in the event of a failure in the original data region. While certain geographic jurisdictions are shown for illustration in the present disclosure the geographic jurisdictions can be different and in some embodiments can all be within a particular country s jurisdiction.

Accordingly the customer may interact with a disaster recovery service provided by the computing resource service provider in order to reproduce this data and transfer this data to an alternative data region . The disaster recovery service may be managed and operated in a variety of data regions. However the computing resource service provider may configure a domain name system DNS service to resolve a customer request to access the disaster recovery service to a separate objective data region . The use of an objective data region for the disaster recovery service may prevent the loss or unavailability of the service in the event of a failure of the original data region or in the event of a lack of resources resulting from the reproduction of data in the alternative data region . Accordingly the disaster recovery service may be configured to determine the original data region comprising the customer s resources and the alternative data region that is to be used to provide the host of services and make the resources available in the event of a region failure. This may allow the disaster recovery service to determine which data region may serve as the objective data region upon a failover scenario. While the use of a single objective data region is used throughout the present disclosure for the purpose of illustration the computing resource service provider may configure more than one objective data region for monitoring and detecting data region failures. For instance the computing resource service provider may use multiple objective data regions in order to establish such as through a quorum of the multiple objective data regions that a data region failure has occurred.

The computing resource service provider may configure the disaster recovery service to provide a graphical user interface GUI to the customer such that the customer may specify certain parameters for the failover scenario. For instance the customer may use the GUI to specify a recovery point objective RPO time which may correspond to the maximum tolerable period in which customer data may be lost due to a region failure. For example a customer may specify that he she may be able to withstand a four minute loss of data. Additionally the customer may specify a corresponding recovery time objective RTO which may correspond to the duration of time within which the data must be restored after a region failure in order to avoid significant impact to the customer s operations. The customer may also use the GUI to specify the alternative data region that may be used to support this failover scenario namely the host for the variety of services and resources the customer may currently rely on in the original data region . For some sets of computing resources parameters for a failover scenario may specify dependencies among the various resources potentially involved in a failover. For example a resource provided by one service e.g. virtual computer system service may rely on resources provided by another service e.g. certain data objects stored by a data storage service . Such relationships may be represented by an appropriate data structure such as a data structure that encodes a directed acyclic graph DAG with nodes representing specific resources and edges representing dependencies with the direction of an edge between two nodes specifying which resource represented by a node depends on the other resource represented by the other node. Accordingly the customer may specify a number of services and resources that should be included in the failover scenario in order to support its business in the event of a region failure.

Once the customer has completed generating the failover scenario the disaster recovery service may transmit one or more executable instructions to the affected services in order to coordinate and begin the reproduction of the specified resources. Accordingly the affected services may perform the reproduction of these resources according to the present configuration of the services. For instance a virtual computing system service may be configured to generate a snapshot of an existing virtual machine instance and transmit this snapshot to a host slot in the alternative data region for instantiation. In an embodiment the disaster recovery service is configured to transmit these instructions in a manner that may provide a level of precedence and relationships between the affected services. For instance the disaster recovery service may provide executable instructions to a database service to reproduce and transmit one or more databases necessary for management of a virtual machine instance to the alternative data region prior to the transmission of the virtual machine instance itself.

As illustrated in at some time the original data region may become unavailable due to a failure e.g. system failure natural disaster terrorism excessive latency in one or more data zones etc. . Accordingly a disaster recovery service within an objective data region may be configured to detect a failure of the original data region and initiate the failover process to restore customer access to the one or more services and availability of the resources included in the failover scenario. The disaster recovery service may be configured to interact with a DNS service to process any customer requests to access these services and resources and resolve them to the services and resources provided in an alternative data region . Additionally the disaster recovery service may be configured to observe and coordinate the failover process to ensure that the services and resources are made available according to the particular customer set parameters and according to the dependencies among the services and resources. Thus in the event of a failure of the original data region the customer may be able to access the services and the resources necessary to support its business needs may be available.

As noted above the computing resource service provider may maintain one or more data regions which in turn may comprise one or more data zones for providing a number of services to the customer and for allowing the customer to generate and maintain resources necessary to support its business needs. Accordingly is an illustrative example of an environment in which various embodiments can be implemented. As noted above the computing resource service provider may host a variety of services in multiple locations worldwide. Accordingly each of these locations may include one or more data regions which may be used by customer to access the services provided by the computing resource service provider and to generate a variety of resources that may be used to support its business. For instance a customer may access a data region in order utilize a virtual computing system service to initiate a virtual machine instance. Accordingly this virtual machine instance may be instantiated within that particular data region and thus may be independent from any other virtual machine instances in another data region. Thus if a customer accesses a second data region the resource that may have been generated in the first data region may not be available in this second data region.

Each independent data region may comprise a number of isolated locations or data zones which may be designed to be isolated from other data zone failures. Each data zone within a data region may be connected through one or more links which may allow a customer to generate one or more replicas of the customer s resources in other data zones within the data region. Thus if there is a failure of one data zone within a data region the resources may still be available through a different data zone. In order to maintain this isolation each data zone may operate using its own distinct infrastructure e.g. servers power supplies cooling systems networking systems security systems etc. which may obviate the need to share common points of failure with other data zones within a data region . Thus in the event of a failure of a particular data zone e.g. system failure natural disaster terrorism etc. other data zones within the data region may not be affected.

However if there is a significant failure resulting in the unavailability of a particular data region the customer may need to access a different data region in order to access the services provided by a computing resource service provider and the customer s resources. Accordingly the customer may interact with a disaster recovery service in order to specify an alternative data region in which its resources should be replicated in and the specific time parameters that should be complied with in order to minimize the impact of a regional failure. For instance the customer may specify an RTO and RPO time period for which the resources should be restored and for how up to date the resources should be when restored respectively. Thus based at least in part on the RTO and RPO the disaster recovery service may be configured to execute a recovery plan necessary to satisfy the RTO and RPO and accordingly transmit executable instructions to the services in the data region to initiate the reproduction process. Thus the services in the data region may replicate the various customer resources and transfer these replicated resources to the alternative data region to support the disaster recovery scenario.

As noted above each data zone may be configured to provide a number of services which may be used by a customer to support its business. Accordingly is an illustrative example of the one or more services that may be maintained and operated within a data zone according to at least one embodiment. In this illustrative example the computing resource service provider may configure each data zone to provide at least seven types of services. The services provided by the computing resource service provider that may be included in each data zone in this example include a virtual computer system service an object based data storage service a block level data storage service a database service a data storage archive service a domain name service a disaster recovery service and one or more other services although not all embodiments of the present disclosure will include all such services and additional services may be provided in addition to or as an alternative to services explicitly described herein. Each service may comprise an interface which may utilized by the customer to access computing resources that may be included in the respective service.

The virtual computer system service may be a collection of computing resources configured to instantiate virtual machine instances onto virtual computing systems on behalf of the customers of the computing resource service provider. Customers of the computing resource service provider may interact with the virtual computer systems service to provision and operate virtual computer systems that are instantiated on physical computing devices hosted and operated by the computing resource service provider. The virtual computer systems may be used for various purposes such as to operate as servers supporting a website. Other applications for the virtual computer systems may be to support database applications electronic commerce applications business applications and or other applications.

The object based data storage service may comprise a collection of computing resources that collectively operate to store data for a customer. The data stored in the object based data storage service may be organized into data objects. The data objects may have arbitrary sizes except perhaps for certain constraints on size. Thus the object based data storage service may store numerous data objects of varying sizes. The object based data storage service may operate as a key value store that associates data objects with identifiers of the data objects which may be used by the customer to retrieve or perform other operations in connection with the data objects stored by the data storage service . Access to the data storage service may be through appropriately configured API calls.

The block level data storage service may comprise a collection of computing resources that collectively operate to store data for a customer. For instance the block level data storage system may be configured to provide block level data storage volumes for use with a virtual machine instance as noted above. A customer may interact with the block level data storage service to provision a block level data storage volume that in turn may be mounted as a storage device e.g. hard drive onto a virtual machine instance. The storage volume may be configured to behave like a raw unformatted block storage device with a block level customer interface. Accordingly a customer through properly configured API calls to the service may create a file system on top of the block level data storage volumes or utilize the volume as a block level storage device e.g. a hard drive .

The database service may be a collection of computing resources that collectively operate to run one or more databases for one or more customers. Customers of the computing resource service provider may operate and manage a database from the database service by utilizing appropriately configured API calls. This in turn may allow a customer to maintain and potentially scale the operations in the database.

The data storage archive service may comprise a collection of computing resources that collectively operate to provide storage for data archiving and backup of customer data. The data storage archive service may thus be configured to persistently store data that may be infrequently accessed and for which long retrieval times are acceptable to a customer utilizing the service. A customer may interact with the data storage archive service to generate one or more archives. Each archive may represent one or more data files that may be combined to form the archive. Accordingly a customer through appropriately configured API calls to the service may upload and retrieve archives from the data storage archive service and monitor the retrieval of these archives as each retrieval job may typically require several hours to complete.

The Domain Name System DNS service may be designed to give customers a method to route end users to one or more communications network applications. For instance the DNS service may be configured to translate human readable names such as uniform resource locators URLs into numeric Internet Protocol IP addresses that computer systems may use to connect to each other over the Internet. Thus the DNS service may be configured to connect requests to access one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider to the infrastructure that is operating within a data zone . The DNS service may additionally be configured to route customers of the computing resource service provider to infrastructure outside of the data zone such as another computing system operated by a separate provider.

The disaster recovery service may be designed to allow a customer to generate a disaster recovery scenario to provide redundant availability of customer resources in the event of a regional failure. Accordingly the disaster recovery service may comprise a management layer over the other existing services provided by the computing resource service provider to its customers. This service may operate in each data zone within a data region to ensure the availability of the service in the event of a data zone failure or a data region failure. For instance if a customer maintains one or more resources in a particular data region the computing resource service provider may utilize the DNS service described above to direct the customer to an instance of the disaster recovery service in an objective data region. This may allow the customer to not only generate a disaster recovery scenario but also maintain access to the disaster recovery service if there is a regional failure.

The disaster recovery service may be configured to generate one or more graphical user interfaces GUIs which may be used by the customer to interface with the service. These GUIs may enable the customer to specify the particular RTO and RPO time periods necessary to prevent substantial impact to the customer s business in the event of a regional failure. Additionally the GUIs may also enable the customer to specify the resources that should be included in the disaster recovery scenario for failover purposes. Thus any specified resources may be reproduced and transmitted to an alternative data region of the customer s choosing. The customer may utilize the disaster recovery service to test any disaster recovery scenario to ensure that the resources have been reproduced properly and that these resources are available within the RPO and RTO in the event of a regional failure.

In order to properly reproduce the customer resources specified the disaster recovery service may be configured to transmit one or more executable instructions to the affected services specified by the customer. These executable instructions may cause the affected services to reproduce these resources according to the particular configuration of each of the affected services. For instance the virtual computer system service described above may be configured to obtain a snapshot of an existing virtual machine instance. The snapshot may include the current operational state of the virtual machine instance at a given time including information identifying an entry point for resumption of execution. This snapshot may be transferred to an alternative data region and activated in order to allow a customer to utilize the virtual machine instance upon a failover. The executable instructions may further cause the affected services to perform the reproduction of these resources according to the RPO and RTO provided by the customer. Thus the affected services may be configured to determine the frequency for which actions should be taken to reproduce and transfer the existing resources to an alternative data region.

The disaster recovery service may additionally be configured to consider a precedence of operations and the relationship i.e. dependencies between the various services and resources utilized by the customer to determine which resources may need to be reproduced first to support other resources. For instance the disaster recovery service may be configured to transmit executable instructions to the database service to transfer one or more reproduced databases to the alternative data region that may be necessary to instantiate an existing virtual machine instance. Accordingly once the databases have been transferred to the alternative data region the disaster recovery service may transmit executable instructions to the virtual computer system service to obtain a snapshot of the instance and transfer this snapshot to the alternative data region. Thus when the snapshot is used to activate the instance the necessary databases may be available to support the instantiation of the instance.

The computing resource service provider may additionally maintain one or more other services based on the needs of its customers. For instance the computing resource service provider may maintain an account service which may comprise a collection of computing resources that collectively operate to maintain customer account information for each customer of the computing resource service provider. The account service may include for example the customer name address phone numbers billing details and other personal identification information for each customer of the computing resource service provider. Additionally the account service may include cryptographic keys or other credentials that may be used to verify that a customer has the proper authorization to access the one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Other services include but are not limited to authentication services and services that manage other services and or other services.

As noted above the disaster recovery service may be configured to obtain one or more parameters from a customer to generate one or more executable instructions that may be transmitted to a number of services in order to generate a disaster recovery scenario. Accordingly is an illustrative example of one or more components that may comprise the disaster recovery service in accordance with at least one embodiment. The disaster recovery service may be configured to provide customers with an interface that may enable a customer to access the disaster recovery service. A customer may utilize the interface through one or more communications networks such as the Internet. The interface may include certain security safeguards to ensure that the customer has authorization to access the disaster recovery service . For instance in order to access the disaster recovery service a customer may need to provide a username and a corresponding password when using the interface . Additionally requests e.g. API calls submitted to the interface may require an electronic signature generated using a cryptographic key such that the electronic signature is verifiable by the disaster recovery service such as by an authorization system not shown .

As will be illustrated further in connection with the interface may be configured to provide a customer with a GUI for providing one or more parameters necessary to create the disaster recovery scenario. For instance the customer may use the GUI to specify the RTO and RPO time periods necessary to prevent significant impact to the customer s business operations and needs. Additionally the customer may specify the resources necessary to support the failover process through the GUI. Once the disaster recovery scenario has been created the disaster recover service may allow the customer to utilize the interface to test the disaster recovery scenario through the GUI as illustrated in . Accordingly the interface may be configured to utilize the customer inputs from the GUI to generate and transmit one or more appropriately configured API calls to a management sub system which may be configured to generate and maintain the disaster recovery scenario. In an alternative embodiment the customer may use the interface to submit these API calls directly to the management sub system in order to generate the disaster recovery scenario.

The management sub system may receive the one or more appropriately configured API calls from the interface and accordingly initiate the process to generate the disaster recovery scenario. For instance the management sub system may be configured to generate one or more executable instructions that may be tailored to the particular services specified by the customer through the interface . For example as illustrated above the management sub system may be configured to transmit one or more instructions to a virtual computing system service which may cause the virtual computing system service to obtain a snapshot of an existing virtual machine instance and transmit this instance to an alternative data region. As noted above the disaster recover service may be operated and maintained in an objective data region that is different from the data region the customer is currently using to access a variety of services to support its business needs. Thus the management sub system may be configured to transmit one or more instructions to a variety of services located in the customer s data region.

The management sub system may also be configured to interact with a rules engine in order to determine if any of the operations affecting the services require prioritization or precedence in order to coordinate the various services and successfully create the disaster recovery scenario. For instance the rules engine may be configured to interact with the services the customer utilizes to determine whether any of the customer resources require other resources to operate. For example as illustrated above a virtual machine instance may require that one or more databases be present in order to operate properly. Accordingly the rules engine may maintain precedence for the customer databases to be reproduced and transferred to the alternative data region prior to instantiating the virtual machine instance in this alternative data region. Additionally if the customer did not specify these databases using the interface the rules engine may be used to locate these additional necessary resources for supporting the customer specified resources that are to be included in the disaster recovery scenario.

The management sub system based at least in part on the parameters specified by the customer through the interface e.g. RPO and RTO may provision one or more servers for tracking certain metrics during the failover process e.g. reproducing and transmitting resources from one data region to an alternative data region and providing the necessary capabilities and coordination necessary for the various services to reproduce and transmit customer resources to the alternative data region. For example if the customer provides short RPO and RTO time periods e.g. the resources should comprise near current data and should be made available within a short period of time upon a failure the management sub system may be configured to provision a significant amount of servers to the services in order to support the reproduction of the resources and support the failover process in the event of a failure. Alternatively if the customer specifies longer RPO and or RTO time periods the management sub system may be configured to provision fewer servers to support the various services .

In the event of a data region failure the management sub system may be configured to monitor the alternative data region to ensure that the customer resources have been failed over according to the provided RPO and RTO time periods. Additionally the management sub system may be configured to interact with a DNS service as illustrated in to resolve any customer requests to the services to the alternative data region where the resources have been reproduced. The management sub system may be configured to transmit one or more executable instructions to the interface which may cause the interface to provide information to the customer with regard to the data region failure and the status of the disaster recovery scenario.

As noted above the disaster recovery service may be configured to provide the customer with a GUI which may be used to specify one or more parameters for the creation and maintenance of a disaster recovery scenario. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a GUI for selecting one or more parameters for a disaster recovery scenario in accordance with at least one embodiment. The GUI may include a recovery point objective RPO input field for specifying the RPO time period for recovery of the particular customer resources. As noted above the RPO may correspond to the maximum tolerable period in which data might be lost as a result of a data region failure. For instance as illustrated in if a customer specifies that the RPO should be set to fifteen minutes the disaster recovery service may be configured to coordinate with the various services utilized by the customer to maintain the customer resources to continuously maintain reproductions of these resources according to the RPO. The RPO input field may be configured to include options for the RPO time period in varying units of time e.g. seconds minutes hours days etc. . Alternatively the RPO input field may be configured to allow a customer to input his her own time period according to certain criteria. For instance a customer may be required to utilize only alphanumeric characters when inputting a time period into the RPO input field .

Additionally the GUI may include a recovery time objective RTO input field for specifying the RTO time period for recovery of the particular customer resources. As noted above the RTO may correspond to the duration of time within which customer resources must be restored upon a data region failure in order to avoid significant impact to the customer s business operations and needs. For instance as illustrated in if a customer specifies that the RTO should be set to six hours the disaster recovery service may be configured to coordinate with the various services utilized by the customer to ensure the disaster recovery scenario can be activated and all resources made available to the customer within the six hour RTO. As with the RPO input field described above the RTO input field may be configured to include options for the RTO time period in varying units of time. Alternatively the RTO input field may be configured to allow a customer to input his her own time period according to certain criteria e.g. only alphanumeric characters are permitted etc. .

In addition to the RPO input field and the RTO input field the GUI may be configured to allow a customer to specify an alternative data region e.g. recovery data region where the reproduced resources should be transferred to in order to support the disaster recovery scenario. Accordingly the GUI may include a recovery data region input field . The recovery data region input field may be configured to include a drop down menu that with customer interaction with the field may present other data regions that may be used to support the disaster recovery scenario. For example as illustrated in the customer may specify that resources should be reproduced and transferred to the New York Bronx Region recovery data region. This region may be different from the data region where the customer s resources are currently stored and used from. Thus the recovery data region input field may be configured to omit the current data region used by the customer to support its existing resources. Additionally the choice of a recovery data region may dictate the objective data region that is used to provide the disaster recovery service for the customer. For instance if the customer selected the New York Bronx Region from the recovery data region input field any subsequent interactions with the disaster recovery service may be directed to the service within a data region that is different from both the original data region used to persistently store and maintain the customer s resources and the recovery data region specified in the recovery data region input field.

Once the customer has provided a valid RPO RTO and recovery data region for the disaster recovery scenario the customer may use a next button to proceed to the next GUI and select their resources for reproduction as will be described below in connection with . In an embodiment if the customer has not provided a valid RPO RTO or recovery data region using the next button may cause a customer interface to generate a separate GUI that may include an error message indicating that one or more inputs are invalid. Thus the customer may need to provide valid entries for the RPO RTO and recovery data region in order to continue. Alternatively the customer may use a cancel button to terminate the GUI and cancel the creation of a disaster recovery scenario.

As noted above the disaster recovery service may incorporate a GUI for which may be used by a customer to select one or more resources that may be included in the disaster recovery scenario. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a GUI for selecting one or more resources for a disaster recovery scenario in accordance with at least one embodiment. The GUI may be introduced to the customer upon selecting the RPO RTO and recovery data region and subsequently using the next button illustrated in . The GUI may include a service selection window which may be configured to list the one or more services a customer may currently use to support its business needs. Thus the customer may use the service selection window to select one or more services that may include resources necessary for the creation of the disaster recovery scenario. For example as illustrated in the customer may specify that he she wants to generate a disaster recovery scenario using the virtual computer system service and a database service. It should be noted that the services listed in is not an exhaustive list of services provided by a computing resource service provider and as described in connection with above the computing resource service provider may operate and maintain a variety of different services for customer use.

The GUI may additionally include a resource selection window which may be configured to list the one or more resources associated with the one or more services selected in the service selection window . For instance when a customer selects a service using the service selection window the GUI may display the one or more customer resources associated with the selected service on the resource selection window . Thus the disaster recovery service may be configured to access the selected services to identify and locate any relevant customer resources that may be included in these selected services. The disaster recovery service may be configured to transmit executable instructions to an interface as described in which may cause the interface to display these resources through the GUI . Accordingly the customer may select one or more resources from the resource selection window that may be included in the disaster recovery scenario. Additionally in an embodiment the GUI may be configured to automatically select any other resources that may be necessary to support the resources the customer has selected. This may support the coordination of the failover process and minimize the downtime of any services and resources necessary to support the customer s business needs.

Once the customer has selected the services and associated resources that may be included in the disaster recovery scenario the customer may use the next button to initiate the creation of the disaster recovery scenario and proceed to the next screen. Accordingly the disaster recovery service may obtain the list of selected services and resources from the GUI and proceed to interact with a rules engine and the selected services to generate one or more executable instructions which may cause the selected service to initiate reproduction of the resources selected by the customer and any other resources necessary to support the customer selected resources. Additionally the disaster recovery service may be configured to allocate a number of servers necessary to generate and support the disaster recovery scenario. As noted above the servers selected for this process may depend upon the customer specified RPO RTO and resources selected using the GUI described in and the GUI .

The GUI may additionally include a cancel button . The cancel button may provide a customer an option to terminate the GUI and to cease the creation of the disaster recovery scenario. For instance if the customer wishes to modify the RPO RTO or recovery data region the customer may use the cancel button to close the GUI and initiate the process of creating a disaster recovery scenario anew. While the use of a next button and a cancel button is used extensively throughout the present disclosure for the purpose of illustration the GUI may include additional buttons. For instance the GUI may include a back button which may allow a customer to return to the GUI illustrated in to make additional modifications to the parameters for the disaster recovery scenario.

Once the customer has completed selecting the services and resources necessary to create the disaster recovery scenario and has acknowledged this selection the customer may be presented with an additional GUI illustrating the status of the disaster recovery scenario. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a GUI for providing status of a disaster recovery scenario and testing the scenario in accordance with at least one embodiment. The GUI may include a scenario status screen which may be configured to display the status of the disaster recovery scenario being created. For instance as illustrated in the scenario status screen may be configured to display the estimated amount of time remaining until the disaster recovery scenario is completed. The scenario status screen may additionally be configured to display other useful information. For example the scenario status screen may be configured to display the status of any reproduced resources and any relevant metrics such as estimated RPO for the resources. Thus the customer may use the scenario status screen to ensure that the resources have been reproduced properly and according to the customer s specifications. The scenario status screen may be used to display other metrics depending on the configuration of the GUI .

The GUI may additionally include a testing button which may be used by a customer to initiate a test of the disaster recovery scenario. For instance if the customer uses the testing button to initiate a test the interface may transmit one or more API calls to the management sub system to initiate the failover process and transmit test data to the services in the alternative data region e.g. customer specified recovery data region where the reproduced customer resources may reside. Accordingly the management sub system may evaluate the failover process to ensure that the process satisfies the RPO and RTO specified by the customer.

Thus the GUI may additionally include a testing status window for displaying relevant failover metrics. For instance once the customer has used the testing button the testing status window may be configured to display metrics associated with the failover process. For example the testing status window may be configured to display the corresponding RPO for each resource reproduced in the recovery data region. Thus the customer may verify that the RPO has been satisfied. Additionally once the test is complete the testing status window may display the amount of time that was required to complete the failover process and provide a comparison of this amount of time and the RTO. This may allow a customer to verify that the failover process additionally complies with the RTO. The testing status window may be configured to display additional information such as metrics related to the latency of the connection and available network bandwidth. In this illustrative example the testing status window may display that testing cannot be performed until the disaster recovery scenario has been created. Thus using the testing button may not initiate a test.

The GUI may additionally include an exit button for terminating the GUI. Thus once the customer has completed testing or is satisfied that the disaster recovery scenario has been created properly the customer may use the exit button to terminate the GUI and resume using the various services and resources necessary to support its business. It should be noted that at any point the customer may use the interface as described in to access the GUI and perform additional tests on the created disaster recovery scenario. Additionally the GUIs described in may be accessed in order for the customer to modify an existing disaster recovery scenario.

As noted above the management sub system may be configured to interact with the various services provided by the computing resource service provider along with a rules engine to determine the relationship between the customer specified resources and any other resources that may support the customer specified resources. Additionally the management sub system may be configured to evaluate any precedence that must be considered when reproducing the resources necessary to create the disaster recovery scenario. For example if a customer using the GUI specifies that a particular virtual machine instance should be reproduced and operational in the alternative data region the management sub system may interact with the virtual computing system service to evaluate this virtual machine instance and determine whether any additional resources are necessary to instantiate the virtual machine instance. Thus if the management sub system identifies any additional resources and determines that these additional resources must be present prior to instantiation of the virtual machine instance the management sub system may consider this precedence.

Accordingly the management sub system may be configured to generate and transmit executable instructions to the one or more affected services to initiate the reproduction of the resources necessary to create the disaster recovery scenario. As noted above the management sub system may be configured to consider the relationship and precedence that may exist between a number of resources associated with one or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Thus the management sub system may be configured to interact with a rules engine to generate a set of instructions that may be transmitted to the one or more services to support the creation of the disaster recovery scenario. For instance using the example above the management sub system may be configured to transmit executable instructions to a database service which may cause the database service to reproduce and transfer one or more databases to the recovery data region. These databases may be necessary to support one or more virtual machine instances. Thus once the databases are present in the recovery data region the management sub system may transmit one or more executable instructions to the virtual computer system service to reproduce and transfer one or more virtual machine instances to the recovery data region.

The executable instructions generated by the management sub system may be configured to be compatible with the affected service. For instance the executable instructions when received by a virtual computer system service may cause the virtual computer system service to obtain a snapshot for each of the one or more selected virtual machine instances. These snapshots may then be transferred to the recovery data region where the virtual computer system service in that recovery data region may use the snapshot to instantiate the one or more virtual machine instances. In this manner an affected service may perform the reproduction and transfer of the selected resources according to its own configuration.

Once the necessary resources have been reproduced and transferred to the recovery data region the one or more services from both the original data region and the recovery data region may provide confirmation that the process has been performed. Accordingly the management sub system may receive confirmation from the one or more affected services that the resources have been reproduced and transferred successfully. It should be noted that the management sub system may not receive confirmation from the one or more affected services if there was a problem in the reproduction and transfer of the necessary resources to create the disaster recovery scenario. For instance the recovery data region specified may be at capacity and may be unable to persistently store the necessary resources to support the disaster recovery scenario. Alternatively the one or more services in the original data region may be unable to reproduce the necessary resources. Thus the process may terminate if confirmation is not received which may cause the management sub system to interact with the interface to inform the customer of the issue.

Once the management sub system has received confirmation from the one or more services on both the original data region and the recovery data region the management sub system may proceed to verify that the reproduced resources in the recovery data region are accessible. As noted above the customer may specify an RPO for the various resources. Thus the management sub system may be configured to compare the reproduced resources to the source resources to ensure that the reproduced resources satisfy the RPO requirement. Additionally the management sub system may be configured to perform one or more actions that may involve these reproduced resources. For instance the management sub system may be configured to activate the reproduced virtual machine instance to ensure that it is operational and ready for customer use. The verification of the reproduced resources may be performed one or more times over time to ensure that these resources satisfy the RPO and RTO requirements specified by the customer.

Upon a failure of a data region the disaster recovery service may perform one or more operations to ensure that a customer that has utilized the disaster recovery service to generate a disaster recover scenario is able to access his her resources. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a process for failing over to an alternative data region in the event of a region failure in accordance with at least one embodiment. As with the process illustrated in the process may be performed by a properly configured management sub system included in a disaster recovery service. The management sub system may be configured to observe all other data regions to determine whether a data region is experiencing a failure. The computing resource service provider may provide certain parameters for determining when a regional failure occurs. For instance a data region may be considered to have failed if two or more data zones within the data region are unavailable or have failed in some other way. The parameters for determining when a regional failure occurs may additionally be more complex. For instance a data region may be considered to have failed if one or more performance metrics e.g. latency processing speed etc. corresponding to the particular resources do not meet a certain threshold across a number of data zones within the data region. Thus the management sub system may be configured to detect a failure of a number of data zones within a data region. Thus if a certain number of data zones have failed the management sub system may determine that the entire data region has failed and initiate the failover process to activate the disaster recovery scenario for each customer affected.

At any point during the failover process the management sub system may receive one or more requests from a customer to access one or more resources in the failed data region. For instance upon detection of a regional failure the disaster recovery service may be configured to interact with a DNS service to redirect any requests to the disaster recovery service. Thus the management sub system may use these requests to identify the particular customer resources that may have been reproduced and identify the associated recovery data region for the disaster recovery scenario.

Once the management sub system has identified the applicable recovery data region that comprises the reproduced resources requested by the customer the management sub system may update the DNS to resolve to the recovery data region. For instance if the URL provided by the customer originally corresponded to an IP address of a virtual computer system service in the failed data region the management sub system may interact with the DNS service to identify the IP address of the virtual computer system service in the recovery data region and associate the URL with this different IP address. Thus the customer may automatically be redirected to the reproduced resources subject to the disaster recovery scenario.

At a later point the management sub system may interact with the interface provided by the disaster recovery service to inform the affected customers of the detected data region failure. For instance the management sub system may be configured to transmit one or more executable instructions to the interface that may cause the interface to display a GUI with relevant information regarding the data region failure and the steps taken to mitigate the impact of the failure. Additionally the management sub system may trigger an alarm or other notification system that may inform the affected customers of the failure.

It should be noted that the operations included in the process may be performed in a different order. For instance the management sub system may be configured to inform the affected customer of the detected data region failure immediately after the initial detection and prior to receiving any requests to access one or more resources in the failed data region.

Additionally the management sub system may be configured to update the DNS to resolve to the recovery data region prior to receiving any requests from a customer to access the one or more resources. This may allow the management sub system to interact with the DNS service to automatically process any URLs to the recovery data region.

As noted above the management sub system component of the disaster recovery service may transmit one or more executable instructions to the one or more services comprising customer resources specified in the GUI. Accordingly is an illustrative example of a process for reproducing resources and transmitting these resources to an alternative data region in accordance with at least one embodiment. The reproduction of these resources may be performed by one or more services provided by a computing resource service provider as selected by a customer. A management sub system of a disaster recovery service may generate a disaster recovery scenario based at least in part on services and associated resources selected by a customer through the use of an interface as illustrated in . For instance the interface may be configured to provide one or more GUIs as illustrated in which may allow a customer to specify certain parameters for the disaster recovery scenario and the resources that must be reproduced to support the customer s business.

Accordingly the management sub system may use the selected services and resources to generate one or more executable instructions which may be transmitted to the various selected services for processing. Thus a selected service may receive executable instructions from the disaster recovery service to initiate reproduction of one or more resources that the customer has specified. These instructions may include certain parameters necessary for the reproduction of the customer s resources and other resources necessary to support the failover process. For instance the executable instructions may include an RPO and RTO time period that must be complied with in order to prevent significant impact to the customer s business.

Based at least in part on the parameters specified in the executable instructions and the specific resources selected by the customer for reproduction the selected service may determine the one or more actions that may be required to reproduce the necessary resources. For instance if the customer provides a short RPO time period the executable instructions may cause the selected service to reproduce the necessary resources numerous times over a period of time to ensure that the RPO time period is satisfied. Additionally each service provided by the computing resource service provider may reproduce a number of resources in varying ways dependent upon the configuration of each service. For example as illustrated above a virtual computer system service may be configured to obtain a snapshot of an existing virtual machine instance. This snapshot may comprise the current state of the virtual machine instance when the snapshot was taken. This snapshot may then be transmitted to another data region for instantiation. In another example an object based data storage service may be configured to create a new logical data container to identify any reproduced resources. Accordingly these reproduced resources may be quickly identified and transferred to the recovery data region. Once the selected service has determined the actions necessary to reproduce the resources the selected service may perform these actions and accordingly reproduce the resources.

Once the necessary resources have been successfully reproduced the selected service may be configured to transfer these reproduced resources to the recovery data region. As noted above each data region may comprise a number of data zones. Each data zone may include a replica of the services provided by the computing resource service provider. Additionally the executable instructions provided by the disaster recovery service may include the destination for any reproduced resources. Thus the selected service may be configured to obtain the reproduced resource and transfer it to a particular data zone within the recovery data region that is to be used to support the failover process. Additionally the selected service may be configured to receive confirmation from the recovery data region that the reproduced resources have been transferred successfully.

Once the reproduced resources have been transferred to the recovery data region the selected service may transmit confirmation of the successful transfer to the disaster recovery service. As noted above the disaster recovery service may be configured to verify that the reproduced resources are accessible upon receipt of confirmation. Thus confirmation of the successful transfer of the reproduced resources may allow the disaster recovery service to continue testing the disaster recovery scenario and inform the customer that the scenario is ready in the event of a data region failure.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. Servers as used herein may be implemented in various ways such as hardware devices or virtual computer systems. In some contexts servers may refer to a programming module being executed on a computer system. As used herein the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device handling some even a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server may provide access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the web server in the form of HyperText Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the web server. It should be understood that the web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.

The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user through a device operated by the user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser. It should be noted however that embodiments of the present disclosure are not necessarily limited to the context of web pages but may be more generally applicable to processing requests in general where the requests are not necessarily requests for content.
