The invention relates to preparing imidazo 1 5 a pyridinium ion fluorophores and detecting cations and hydrophobic components.

Small molecule fluorophores are becoming important tools for visualizing analytes of biological relevance. Quantitative data about the analytes is often obtained by detecting changes in the fluorescence emission of select probe molecules that bind them which can result from photoinduced electron transfer PET or intramolecular charge transfer ICT . The fluorophores that are often used for these analyses are BODIPY coumarin naphthalimide and fluorescein. Although these fluorophores theoretically can be modified to display either a ratiometric dual emission response through ICT or a change in fluorescence intensity through PET modifying the structure of these compounds to selectively control the excited state photophyscial properties of these compounds typically requires multi step synthetic operations that result in low yields.

For fluorescent probes to operate successfully and universally in a biological system the probe must exhibit water solubility insensitivity to local polarity and minimal interference from background emission. These requirements are difficult to achieve.

The compounds disclosed herein are fluorophores i.e. when excited by radiation of a first wavelength they exhibit fluorescence emission at a second wavelength . The compounds include an imidazo 1 5 a pyridinium ion core and at least one substituent attached to the core. The compounds can exhibit a change in their fluorescence emission properties due to a change in the deexcitation pathway i.e. the mechanism by which the fluorescence emission is modulated . The change in the deexcitation pathway of the compounds can be modulated by photoinduced electron transfer PET or intramolecular charge transfer ICT . A change in the deexcitation pathway can manifest itself as an increase in the intensity of the fluorescence emission a decrease in the intensity of the fluorescence emission a decrease in the intensity of the fluorescence emission at a first wavelength and an increase in the intensity of the fluorescence emission at a second wavelength and combinations thereof. In some embodiments for example the compound responds to a change in the environment surrounding the compound e.g. the presence absence or change in concentration of a cation or of the hydrophobicity of the environment by exhibiting a change in fluorescence emission due to photoinduced electron transfer when the environment is in one state and a change in fluorescence emission due to intramolecular charge transfer when the environment is in another state. This effect can be reversed upon alteration of the environment to one that mimics its initial state.

The presence and mechanism of fluorescence emission can depend upon the substituents on the compound the nature of a binding event with an analyte the environment in which the compound is located and combinations thereof. The substituents on the compound can be selected to achieve compounds having a variety of fluorescence properties when excited by radiation including e.g. compounds that inherently exhibit fluorescence emission upon excitation compounds that do not inherently exhibit fluorescence emission but exhibit fluorescence emission upon a binding event e.g. when the bound to a cation compounds that exhibit fluorescence emission when present in a certain environment e.g. a hydrophobic environment or an aqueous environment compounds that exhibit a change in fluorescence emission in response to a change in the environment in which the compound is located and combinations thereof. A change in a fluorescence property exhibited by a compound can manifest itself as a change in emission intensity a change in the emission wavelength and combinations thereof.

The substituents also can be selected to achieve compounds that function in a variety of modes including e.g. in a turn on mode in which detectable fluorescence emission occurs as the environment changes or a binding event occurs in a turn off mode in which a detectable fluorescence emission ceases to occur as the environment changes or a binding event occurs in a ratiometric response mode in which there are detectable changes in the relative intensity of fluorescence emissions at at least two different wavelengths and combinations thereof. These compounds can be useful as turn on sensors turn off sensors and ratiometric response sensors respectively. At least one property of the detected fluorescence emission e.g. the presence absence and intensity of the emission can be correlated to a property of the system e.g. the presence absence or concentration of a component of interest in the system .

The compounds preferably absorb radiation having a wavelength from about 250 nm to about 600 nm and emit radiation having a wavelength from about 350 nm to about 900 nm.

The compounds emitted at 600 nm with an intensity of about 7.57 10arbitrary units a.u. in neat acetonitrile. When 50 L trifluoroacetic acid was added to the acetonitrile the compounds exhibited no emission at 600 nm but emitted at 400 nm with an intensity of 1.34 10a.u. illustrates the emission properties of Compound 12. The emission properties illustrated in the plot of are also representative of the emission properties exhibited by Compounds 10 and 11.

Compound 12 was placed in water and the intensity of its fluorescence emission at 600 nm was monitored as the concentration of acetonitrile was increased from 0 volume to volume v v to 100 v v in increments of 10 v v . As the acetonitrile concentration increased a corresponding increase in fluorescence intensity occurred from 7.81 10a.u. to 6.48 10a.u. as illustrated in the plots of .

Compound 12 was added to an aqueous solution of sodium dodecylsulfate SDS and monitored for fluorescence emission at 600 nm. Compound 12 exhibited a similar increase in fluorescence emission intensity with increasing SDS concentration as seen in Example 14 with increasing acetonitrile concentration.
