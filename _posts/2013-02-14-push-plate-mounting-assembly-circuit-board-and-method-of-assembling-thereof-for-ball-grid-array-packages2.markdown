This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61 599 321 entitled PUSH PLATE MOUNTING ASSEMBLY CIRCUIT BOARD AND METHOD OF ASSEMBLING THEREOF FOR BALL GRID ARRAY PACKAGES filed Feb. 15 2012 the specification thereof is incorporated herein by reference in the entirety.

The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE AC04 94AL85000 between the United States Department of Energy and Sandia Corporation for the operation of the Sandia National Laboratories.

The present disclosure is generally directed to a device for attaching a ball grid array package assembly to a test socket or printed circuit board and more particularly to a low profile controlled force minimal torque push plate for ball grid array multi chip module test sockets.

Ball grid array BGA packages such as multi chip modules MCMs are small circuit boards that combine several chips usually a microprocessor and support chips into one convenient subsystem. BGA packaging is ubiquitous aspect of modern electronic miniaturization and micro electronic systems. BGA packages use a ball grid array BGA to make electrical connection with a printed circuit board. The BGA is an improvement over the pin grid array which is a package with one face covered with pins in a grid pattern. The pins connect the integrated circuit to a printed circuit board PCB on which it is placed.

The BGA is a solution to the problem of producing a miniature package for an integrated circuit with many hundreds of pins. Pin grid arrays and dual in line surface mount packages are being produced with more and more pins and with decreasing spacing between the pins. As package pins get closer together the danger of accidentally bridging adjacent pins with solder increases. BGAs solve this problem.

The device is assembled on a PCB with copper pads not shown in a pattern that matches the solder balls . The assembly is heated melting the solder balls to the PCB. Surface tension holds the molten solder and the package in alignment with the circuit board while the solder cools and solidifies.

There are several reasons for directly probing a ball grid array package prior to melting the BGA solder balls. Existing sockets for BGAs often needed during development burn in rework inspection troubleshooting and testing tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket. The more reliable type has spring pins commonly referred to as pogopins that push up under the balls. The less reliable type is a ZIF socket with spring pinchers that grab the balls. Neither of these systems work well without sufficient uniform downward force applied to the MCM package or integrated circuit especially if the balls are small.

The push plate includes openings for receiving and engaging the protrusions . The openings are configured so that when the protrusions are received in the openings and the push plate is rotated the push plate becomes engaged and or locked into position with the interlock portion . The openings of the push plate may be configured to pull the push plate towards the test pad portion when the push plate is rotated thus applying a force to the device to push or apply force to the device towards the test pad portion thereby assuring contact between the ball grid array of the device and the pins of the test pad .

To test a device such as a MCM the device is placed upon test pad with the BGA ball side of the device in contact with the pins of the test pad . The push plate is placed upon the device with the protrusions of the interlock portion received in openings of the push plate . The push plate is rotated to lock the device into position against the test pad .

In other designs the push plate may be attached to an interlock portion by other attachment methods and devices such as screws and or clamps. In still other designs a push plate may be initially attached to the interlock portion and opened to receive the device to be tested by a clam shell or lever action.

These push plates illustrate the root of the problem in using these typical push plates in that these existing methods to clamp the ball grid array package to the temporary socket are clumsy and block access to the ball grid array package. In some existing push plate designs there may be a small opening on that socket but it is for the operator to determine if a chip is installed in the socket without opening the lid.

As discussed above the ball grid array package must be held against the spring pins called POGO pins with the push plate with enough force to make good contact but not with enough force to damage the solder balls or the PCB itself. This holding force must be applied uniformly to the ball grid array package without large torques since torques can cause excessive force along an edge or at a corner of the solder ball array causing damage. Thus the top holder for the test socket must supply a known even down force without excessive torques. Current push plate designs for instance the clam shell design as shown in fail to apply an even down force.

In addition to these force and torque requirements there are many instances where physical access to the top of some portion of the ball grid array package chips is needed for example for failure analysis applications and this is universally not possible with current sockets as pointed out previously. Current push plate methods do not allow this access because of the methods used to supply the down force.

Furthermore push plate assemblies may be used as an installation tool for mounting a ball grid array package onto an application PCB. This application has the same problems associated with the inspection and temporary socket application described above limited visual access to the ball grid array package and uneven force applied to the mounted ball grid array package.

The need remains therefore for a device and method that can attach a ball grid array package such as a MCM to a circuit board or test socket that allows for direct probing of the package and that applies an even down force to the package while enabling unfettered access to the top side of the MCM package.

In an embodiment of the present invention a push plate is disclosed that provides a known uniform down force minimizes torque and that does not interfere with access to the top of a ball grid array package while assembling and or testing a ball grid array package hereafter referred to as package . The package may be a conventional ball grid array package such as microprocessors application specific integrated circuits ASIC memories and MCMs used for microprocessors and or field programmable gate arrays. In an embodiment the package may be a MCM. In an embodiment the push plate is used to assemble a package to a socket or PCB that has spring pins that push up under the balls. The push plate has a large viewing window and a minimum thickness so as not to interfere with the visual inspection of the package. The minimum thickness also minimizes interference around the package.

The push plate provides a uniform down force with minimal torque by suspending a down load frame with double cantilever flexures. The cantilevers have a known calculable down force producing stiffness while providing a calibrated down force. The central slit length of the flexures can be lengthened or shortened to produce the desired torque stiffness and or to minimize torque. This effect is enhanced by intrinsically doubling the cantilevers geometrically.

An advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a push plate having direct visual access to the package.

Another advantage of the present disclosure is to provide a push plate that applies uniform down force to the package during assembly with the package holder.

Other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the principles of the disclosure.

Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to represent the same parts.

The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.

The present disclosure is directed to a push plate having a known down force minimal torque that does not interfere with access to the top of a package and has minimum thickness. This is accomplished by suspending a down load frame with double cantilever flexures. The cantilevers have a known calculable down force producing stiffness. While providing a calibrated down force a central slit length can be lengthened or shortened to produce a desired torque stiffness to minimize torque. This effect is enhanced by intrinsically doubling them geometrically.

In an exemplary embodiment the cantilevers are short making them stiff but the double cantilever prevents damage due to torques. Contrasting the above embodiment with the one shown below the cantilevers are longer providing greater compliance less stiffness for the particular application. The resulting push plate is still quite thin allowing good access to the chips on the package. It also has the needed stiffness and the desired torque minimization. The structure of the pusher plate is easily analyzed with finite element methods ensuring the needed stiffnesses and at the same time ensuring the needed material strength.

The central window portion includes an opening which provides visual access to a device to be tested or package not shown . In this exemplary embodiment the opening provides visual access to greater than about 50 of the package. In another embodiment the opening provides visual access to greater than about 20 of the package. In another embodiment the opening provides visual access to greater than about 75 of the package. In another embodiment the opening provides visual access to greater than about 90 of the package. In another embodiment the opening provides visual access to a portion of the package requiring visual inspection.

The springs are configured to apply a known down force with minimal torque to the device to be tested. In this embodiment this is accomplished by suspending a down load frame with double cantilever flexures. The cantilevers have a known calculable down force producing stiffness. While providing a calibrated down force a central slit length can be lengthened or shortened to produce a desired torque stiffness to minimize torque

In this embodiment the push plate includes four springs . The springs connect the central window portion to the outer portion . In another embodiment the push plate may include two or more springs . For example a push plate may include one set of opposing springs that are configured to apply a known down force with calculable torque to the device to be tested. In another embodiment the number and placement of the springs is symmetrical around the opening to apply minimal torque to the device to be tested.

The springs are defined in the push plate by slits that may be increased or decreased in length and or width and or geometry to control the amount of flex and or torsion provided by the spring . In an embodiment the slits are designed with a connective distance D that determines a determinable amount of flex and or torsion by the springs .

In this exemplary embodiment each spring includes one internal slit A. The internal slit A is designed to tailor the flex and or torsion provided by the spring . In another embodiment each spring may include one or more internal slits of various geometries. In another embodiment the internal slit A may be omitted in one or more springs .

The frame includes holes that provide access for a screw bolt or other force adjustable fixture not shown to attach the push plate to a package holder test pad or PCB. For example the push plate may be attached to a package holder as shown in . In this exemplary embodiment the frame includes four holes one in each corner area of the frame . In another embodiment the frame may include two or more holes . In another embodiment the frame may include holes in areas other than the corners of the frame . The holes allow for the fixture to be tightened or loosened to adjust the amount of down force and or torsion the push plate applies to the package.

The frame also includes holes for attaching the push plate to a test pad and or PCB. In this exemplary embodiment the frame includes four holes one in each corner area of the frame . In another embodiment the frame may include two or more holes . In another embodiment the frame may include holes in areas other than the corners of the frame .

In this exemplary embodiment the window is shown surrounded by a beveled frame in another embodiment the frame may be level with the recessed portion .

The push plate is thin allowing good access to the chips on the package. In an embodiment the push plate may be less than about 0.75 cm. In another embodiment the push plate may be less than about 0.50 cm. In yet another embodiment the push plate may be about 0.4 cm. It also has the needed stiffness and the desired torque minimization.

The push plate may be made of a metal polymer plastic composite reinforced material or material combination of any thereof. In an embodiment the push plate is formed of an anodized aluminum. In another embodiment the push plate is formed of aluminum painted with a non conducting paint.

The push plate allows access to the entire package area of interest with a high power microscope lens. Typically the X lens has a short focal length. It needs to be a few millimeters from the package to be effective. Referring again to the push plate compensates for the curvature of the lens housing by including a tapered edge along the opening . This allows for a lens to traverse across the entire package without hitting the push plate .

The package holder includes a frame a recessed portion and a pin array . The frame includes holes for receiving fasteners not shown such as screws bolts or other similar fasteners for attaching the push plate assembly to a PCB not shown . The holes are in alignment with holes of the push plate so in such a manner attachment fasteners may pass through both the push plate and the MCM holder to attach the push plate assembly to a PCB. In this exemplary embodiment the frame includes four holes one in each corner area of the frame . In another embodiment the frame may include two or more holes . In another embodiment the frame may include holes in areas other than the corners of the frame .

The frame also includes holes for receiving fasteners that pass through holes of the push plate . In such a manner the push plate is attached to the package holder . Furthermore in such a manner a package may be sandwiched between the push plate and package holder and fasteners can be passed through the holes and holes to attach the push plate to the package holder .

The recessed portion corresponds with a select package shape or geometry. The recessed portion includes the pin array that corresponds with a package ball grid array. The push plate also includes a recessed portion not shown on the underside not shown of the push plate that corresponds with a select package shape or geometry.

Comparing push plate and push plate it can be seen that the springs of push plate are shorter than the springs of push plate making them stiffer. However the double cantilever prevents damage due to torques. Contrasting springs and springs the cantilevers are longer providing greater compliance less stiffness for the particular application.

The structure of the push plate may be analyzed with finite element methods ensuring the needed stiffnesses and at the same time ensuring the needed material strength. Thus the essence of the invention is the use of double cantilevers to provide stiffness for down force torque minimization and access to the package components both by minimization of thickness and moving the mechanism the cantilevers providing the down force to the perimeter outside the area of the package.
