title: Visualization tools for reviewing credibility and stateful hierarchical access to credibility
abstract: Some embodiments provide a credibility system including an interface portal for presenting a holistic view of entity credibility. To provide the holistic view, the credibility system aggregates credibility data from multiple data sources. The aggregated credibility data is processed and ordered to present different dimensions of entity credibility, with each dimension graphically presented in the interface portal through an interactive credibility module. In some embodiments, the credibility data associated with each credibility module is processed to produce at least one value that quantifiably represents the credibility data. In some embodiments, the credibility data associated with each credibility module is hierarchically ordered to present the credibility data in a drill-down fashion with each hierarchical layer presenting more detailed credibility data for better understanding the credibility data presented in the preceding layer.

The contents of application Ser. Nos. 13 781 723 13 444 467 and 61 474 246 are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention pertains to systems methods processes and tools for visually and interactively presenting credibility of an entity.

Creditworthiness of individuals and businesses has long been a quantifiable measure from which many personal and commercial transactions are based. The creditworthiness of an individual is used to determine terms e.g. amounts and interest rates when individuals seek home mortgage loans personal loans property rental and credit cards. Several credit agencies exist and operate to determine an individual s creditworthiness and to sell that information to interested buyers. Credit agencies derive the creditworthiness of individuals by monitoring individual spending habits payment habits net worth etc. Credit agencies convert these and other monitored behaviors into a quantifiable credit score that has been standardized to range between 300 850 points with a higher score representing greater creditworthiness and a lower score representing lesser creditworthiness.

Business creditworthiness is also a quantifiable measure that drives many business transactions. However deriving business creditworthiness is a fundamentally more complex problem than deriving an individual s creditworthiness. For individuals there is a one to one correspondence between an identifier i.e. social security number and the individual. Such is not the case for many businesses. A business may operate under different names subsidiaries branches and franchises as some examples. Moreover tracking business assets accounts and transactions is further complicated because businesses merge go out of business start anew split etc. Accordingly more resources are needed to monitor and analyze business creditworthiness. Companies such as Dun Bradstreet operate to monitor and derive the creditworthiness of businesses. Business credit reports can be purchased from Dun Bradstreet and other such business credit reporting companies. Sales of such information have become a multi billion dollar industry.

While critical to some small business needs business creditworthiness is often immaterial to determining the day to day success of the small business. For instance whether a client leaves satisfied with a service or a product that has been purchased from the small business is instrumental in determining whether that client will be a repeat customer or will provide referrals to encourage others to visit the small business. A sufficient number of good client experiences beneficially increases the exposure of the small business thereby resulting in better chances of growth success and profitability. Conversely a sufficient number of bad client experiences can doom a small business. The success of the small business is therefore predicated more on generated goodwill reputation satisfaction and other such criteria that impact the small business operations on a day to day basis than it is on business creditworthiness. Goodwill reputation satisfaction and other such criteria that impact the small business operations on a day to day basis are hereinafter referred to as credibility.

Ascertaining the credibility for any entity whether an individual or business is complicated by virtue of the varied and distributed nature of credibility data. Credibility data exists in various forms including qualitative credibility data and quantitative credibility data. Qualitative data includes customer and professional review data blog content and social media content as some examples. Some data sources from which qualitative data about various entities may be acquired are internet websites such as www.yelp.com www.citysearch.com www.zagat.com www.gayot.com www.facebook.com and www.twitter.com. Quantitative data includes different measures of an entity s credibility as quantified to a scale ranking or rating. Consequently credibility data is neither standardized nor normalized and each data source provides an independent and disjoint view of the credibility for an entity. Other factors also affecting the credibility of a particular individual or business entity include the presence and visibility of the entity and the partnerships and relationships established by the entity as some examples.

It is very time consuming inaccurate and difficult for the small business or other entity to piece together its credibility from these varied data sources. Specifically the small business does not have the tools or the resources to continually scour the different credibility data sources to aggregate sufficient credibility data from which to derive its credibility. Further exacerbating the problem is that even when the credibility data is properly aggregated making sense of that credibility data to arrive at an overall view of the business credibility is complicated by the amount of credibility data and the non standard non uniform and qualitative nature of the credibility data.

Accordingly there is a need to provide various visualization tools that provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the creditability of an entity. Moreover entities want to understand the different dimensions of credibility from which their overall credibility is derived. Each credibility dimension provides insight into what parts of the entity are helping its credibility and what parts are detrimentally affecting its credibility. Accordingly there is further a need for the visualization tools to provide a meaningful concise interactive and easily navigable interface from which to understand the derivation of an entity s credibility based on its various dimensions.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a single interface from which credibility of several distinct businesses can be presented. It is further an object to provide a holistic view of the business credibility based on 1 credibility data that is aggregated from multiple data sources and 2 credibility data that accounts for different dimensions of business credibility. It is further an object to provide various tools for users to interact with the credibility data in order to hierarchically visualize the derivation of the individual credibility dimensions.

To achieve the objects and in accordance with the purpose of the invention as embodied and broadly described herein some embodiments provide an interface portal. In some embodiments the interface portal provides a business credibility directory for searching a database storing credibility reports. Based on user submitted search criteria the interface portal obtains one or more reports and parses the reports to generate dynamic websites for presenting the holistic view of business credibility.

In some embodiments the credibility reports are stored as separate data structures comprising data sets that represent various dimensions of credibility. Each dataset stores aggregated derived and or referenced credibility data that is related to a particular dimension of credibility. Moreover each dataset includes one or more hierarchical layers. Each descending hierarchical layer includes credibility data that expands on the credibility data conveyed in the preceding hierarchical layer. This includes providing greater detail more credibility data or enhancing credibility data in the preceding hierarchical layer in order for the user to better understand the derivation of a particular dimension of credibility. In some embodiments different hierarchical layers can be configured with different access permissions so as to restrict access to certain hierarchical layers to pay per access users. In this manner the credibility system provides means to monetize the credibility data of the different credibility dimensions.

In some embodiments the interface portal provides a simultaneous multi dimensional presentation of business credibility also referred to as a credibility review website. The credibility review website provides a summarized view of multiple credibility dimensions on a single site such that a holistic view of credibility that is based on multiple dimensions of credibility and credibility data that is aggregated from multiple data sources can be viewed from a single site. Accordingly users no longer need to visit multiple data sources in order to obtain an unbiased and complete view of credibility. Moreover users no longer have to make sense of non standardized and inconsistent credibility data.

In some embodiments the interface portal provides a modularized multi dimensional presentation of business credibility. Each dimension of credibility is graphically represented by and accessible through an interactive stateful graphical element referred to as an application cube. User interactions with an application cube enable access to the credibility data of a particular credibility dimension. More specifically different credibility data and interactive tools allow users the ability to drill down into the various hierarchical layers of credibility data grouped to each dimension of credibility. Some dimensions of credibility include credibility scoring multimedia visualization of a business including imagery and video feeds geo location and mapping financial information social network content news and network partnerships.

In the following detailed description numerous details examples and embodiments of a credibility scoring and reporting system including the interface portal and methods are set forth and described. As one skilled in the art would understand in light of the present description the system and methods are not limited to the embodiments set forth and the system and methods may be practiced without some of the specific details and examples discussed. Also reference is made to accompanying figures which illustrate specific embodiments in which the invention can be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments can be used and structural changes can be made without departing from the scope of the embodiments herein described.

For any individual or business entity credibility is an invaluable asset. For a business entity credibility can be used to identify successful business practices unsuccessful business practices desired improvements by customers future growth opportunities and changes that can be made to improve the future growth and success of the business. Today credibility exists as qualitative data and as non standardized quantitative measures that selectively gauge various factors about an entity using different ranking systems. However the qualitative and non standardized nature of credibility data results in an intangible asset for which baseline measurements do not exist cross comparisons cannot be made and against which individual biases and scarcity of information undermine the relevancy of the information. Consequently entities especially small business are unable to effectively determine or evaluate their credibility in the marketplace and future strategic decisions are misguided as a result.

To overcome these and other issues and to provide a tangible asset that quantifiably measures the credibility of a particular entity some embodiments provide a credibility scoring and reporting system. The credibility scoring and reporting system generates standardized credibility scores that quantifiably measure credibility for different entities. The credibility scoring and reporting system derives the standardized credibility scores from credibility data that is aggregated from multiple data sources. The standardized credibility scores can then be used to present the credibility of different entities as a readily identifiable score that can be comparatively analyzed against credibility scores of competitors. Moreover the credibility scoring and reporting system generates credibility reports that incorporate the derived credibility scores and that provide an organized and holistic view for the credibility data that is aggregated for each particular entity from unrelated and often incompatible data sources where each data source may compile proprietary credibility data for the particular entity that other data sources do not have. In some embodiments the credibility data that is aggregated for a particular entity is hierarchically organized to a credibility report such that anyone can generally determine the credibility of the particular entity and still be able to determine a detailed understanding of the credibility data that factor into the particular entity s credibility by accessing the different hierarchical layers of credibility data using drilldown functionality. The credibility scoring and reporting system can further process the aggregated credibility data for a particular entity to automatically identify actions that the particular entity can undertake to improve various aspects of its credibility thereby boosting its exposure presence reputation desirability and profitability. Consequently the credibility report serves as a single asset from which a particular entity can identify practices that have been successful practices that have inhibited its success desired improvements by customers future growth opportunities and changes that can be made to improve the future growth and success of the particular entity.

The credibility score accurately represents the credibility of a given entity because i the credibility score is computed using data from varied data sources and is thus not dependent on or disproportionately affected by any single data source ii the credibility data is processed using algorithms that eliminate individual biases from the interpretation of the qualitative credibility data iii the credibility data is processed using filters that eliminate biased credibility data while normalizing different quantitative measures and iv by using the same methods and a consistent set of algorithms to produce the credibility score for a plurality of entities the produced credibility scores are standardized and can be subjected to comparative analysis in order to determine how the credibility score of one entity ranks relative to the credibility scores of other competitors or entities. As a result the credibility score can be sold as a tangible asset to those entities interested in understanding their own credibility.

In some embodiments the process also generates at a credibility report as a separate tangible asset for entities interested in understanding the derivation of their credibility and how to improve their credibility. In some embodiments the credibility report presents relevant credibility data to identify the derivation of the entity s credibility. In some embodiments the credibility report also suggests actions for how the entity can improve upon its credibility.

Some embodiments provide an interface portal from which entities can purchase and view the credibility scores and or credibility reports. Using these assets i.e. credibility scores and credibility reports entities can formulate accurate and targeted objectives to improve their credibility and more importantly their likelihood for future growth and success. Entities will also have access to the credibility scores and credibility reports of other entities. The credibility scores and credibility reports can thus be used to guide clientele to credible businesses and steer clientele away from businesses providing a poor customer experience. Moreover the credibility scores and credibility reports can serve to identify businesses with which a particular business would want to partner with or form relationships with for future business transactions. Accordingly there is incentive for entities to improve upon their credibility as clientele and partners may be looking at the same information when determining whether or not to transact or partner with a particular entity.

The portal further acts as a means by which entities can be directly involved with the credibility scoring and reporting process. Specifically using the interface portal entities can submit pertinent credibility data that may otherwise be unavailable from the data sources and correct mismatched credibility data.

At present an entity can attempt to determine its credibility by analyzing credibility data at various data sources to see what others are saying about the entity. Credibility obtained in this manner is deficient in many regards. Firstly credibility that is derived from one or a few data sources is deficient because a sufficient sampling of credibility cannot be obtained from such few data sources. For example a site that includes only two negative reviews about a particular business entity does not accurately portray the credibility of that particular business entity when that particular business entity services hundreds daily. Moreover one or more of the data sources may have biased data or outdated data that disproportionately impact the credibility of the entity. Secondly credibility that is derived from one or a few data sources is deficient because each data source may contain information as to a particular aspect of the entity. As such credibility derived from such few sources will not take into account the entirety of the entity and can thus be misleading. Thirdly credibility is deficient when it is not comparatively applied across all entities amongst competitors or a particular field or class of entities. For example a critical reviewer may identify a first entity as poor performing and identify a second entity as horribly performing . When viewed separately each entity would be classified with poor credibility. However with comparative analysis the first entity can be classified with better credibility than the second entity. Fourthly credibility data from different reviewers or data sources is not standardized which opens the credibility data to different interpretations and individual biases. For example it is difficult to determine whether for the same entity a 3 out of 5 ranking from www.yelp.com is equivalent to a 26 out of 30 ranking on www.zagat.com. Similarly a review that states the services of a first entity as good can be interpreted by the first entity as a successful or positive review whereas the same review of good for a second entity can be interpreted by the second entity as an average review from which services have to be improved upon.

To address these and other issues in deriving entity credibility some embodiments provide the master data manager to interface with multiple data sources and to automatedly acquire relevant credibility data from these sources at regular and continuous intervals. In so doing the master data manager removes the deficiencies that result from an insufficient sample size outdated data and lack of comparative data.

The master data manager aggregates credibility data from various data sources through the plug in interface modules including and through the interface portal . Each plug in interface module is configured to automatically interface with one or more data sources in order to extract credibility data from those data sources. In some embodiments each plug in interface module is configured with communication protocols scripts and account information to access one or more data sources. Additionally each plug in interface module may be configured with data crawling functionality to extract credibility data from one or more data sources. A particular plug in interface module navigates through a particular data source in order to locate the credibility data. In one illustrated example the master data manager includes a particular plug in interface module to the review aggregator Yelp www.yelp.com . This interface module can be configured with account information to access the www.yelp.com website and a data crawler script to scan through and extract creditability data directly from the website. In some embodiments partnership agreements are established with the data sources whereby the plug in interface modules directly interface with one or more databases of the data sources in order to extract the credibility data.

The extracted credibility data includes qualitative data and quantitative data about one or more entities. Qualitative data includes customer and professional review data blog content and social media content as some examples. Some data sources from which qualitative data about various entities may be acquired are internet websites such as Yelp www.yelp.com CitySearch www.citysearch.com Zagat www.zagat.com Gayot www.gayot.com Facebook www.facebook.com and Twitter www.twitter.com . Accordingly some embodiments of the master data manager include a different plug in interface module to extract the credibility data from each of those sites. Quantitative data includes credit business information e.g. address phone number website etc. and credibility data that is quantitatively measured using some scale ranking or rating. Some quantitative data sources include Dun Bradstreet and the Better Business Bureau BBB . Some qualitative data sources may also include quantitative credibility data. For example www.yelp.com includes qualitative data in the form of textual reviews and comments and quantitative data in the form of a 0 out of 5 rating system. Some embodiments of the master data manager include a different plug in interface module to extract quantitative data from the quantitative data sources.

In some embodiments the credibility data further includes supplemental data that is associated with the aggregated qualitative and quantitative credibility data. Some such supplemental data is associated with the entity profile from which the qualitative and quantitative credibility data is aggregated. This supplemental data may include for example identification information for the entity that originated the credibility data or for the entity that is the recipient or the reference of credibility data. This identification information may include the name address telephone number email URL etc. for the entity. Additionally the supplemental data that is associated with the entity profile can include networking data and recent activity performed by the entity. In some embodiments networking data identifies partnerships that one entity has established with other entities. Networking data may also include associations that one entity has with other entities.

The plug in interface modules allow credibility data from new data sources to be integrated into the master data manager without altering functionality for any other plug in interface modules . This modularity allows the system to scale when additional or newer data sources are desired. Moreover the plug in interface modules allow the credibility data to automatically and continuously be acquired from these various data sources. In some embodiments the aggregated data includes copied text files feeds database records and other digital content.

Qualitative data and quantitative data may also be aggregated from other mediums including print publications e.g. newspaper or magazine articles televised commentary or radio commentary. In some embodiments the data sources access the interface portal in order to provide their credibility data directly to the master data manager . For example relevant magazine articles may be uploaded or scanned and submitted through the interface portal by the publisher. Publications and recordings may also be submitted by mail. An incentive for the publisher to submit such information is that doing so may increase the exposure of the publisher. Specifically the exposure may increase when submitted publications are included within the generated credibility reports of some embodiments.

Credibility data may also be submitted directly by the entity to the master data manager . This is beneficial to small business entities that are unknown to or otherwise ignored by the various data sources. Specifically credibility data can be submitted through the interface portal by the business owner and that data can be incorporated into the credibility scores and credibility reports as soon as the data becomes available. In this manner the business can be directly involved with the credibility data aggregation process and need not depend on other data sources to provide credibility data about the business to the master data manager . For example the Los Angeles County of Health issues health ratings to restaurants on a graded A B and C rating system. Should a restaurant receive a new rating the restaurant business owner can submit the new rating to the master data manager through the interface portal without waiting for a third party data source to do so. A submission may be made via a webpage in which the submitting party identifies himself herself and enters the data as text or submits the data as files.

The master data manager tags data that is aggregated using the plug in modules and data that is submitted through the interface portal with one or more identifiers that identify the entity to which the data relates. In some embodiments the identifiers include one or more of a name phonetic name address unique identifier phone number email address and Uniform Resource Locator URL as some examples. For automatically aggregated credibility data the plug in modules tag the aggregated credibility data with whatever available identifiers are associated with the credibility data at the data source. For example the www.yelp.com site groups reviews and ranking i.e. credibility data for a particular entity on a page that includes contact information about the entity e.g. name address telephone number website etc. . For credibility data that is submitted through the interface portal the submitting party will first be required to create an entity account that includes various identifiers that are to be tagged with the credibility data that is sent by that party. Tagging the credibility data may also include matching supplemental data i.e. identification information supplemental data with aggregated qualitative and quantitative data.

In some cases the tagged identifiers do not uniquely or correctly identify the entity that the data is to be associated with. This may occur when a business entity operates under multiple different names phone numbers addresses URLs etc. Accordingly the master data manager includes matching process that matches the aggregated data to an appropriate entity using a set of matching algorithms from the matching algorithms database . To further ensure the integrity and quality of the data matching some embodiments allow for business owners and other entities to be involved in the matching process .

The matching process begins when tagged credibility data is passed to the automated matching process . The automated matching process uses various matching algorithms from the matching algorithms database to match the credibility data with an appropriate entity. Specifically the credibility data is associated with an identifier that uniquely identifies the appropriate entity. When a match is made the credibility data is stored to the first database using the unique identifier of the entity to which the credibility data is matched. In some embodiments the first database is the database of . In some embodiments the unique identifier is referred to as a credibility identifier. As will be described below the credibility identifier may be one or more numeric or alphanumeric values that identify the entity.

In addition to matching the data to the appropriate entity the automated matching process may also perform name standardization and verification address standardization and verification phonetic name matching configurable matching weights and multi pass error suspense reduction. In some embodiments the automated matching process executes other matching algorithms that match multiple entity listings to each other if ownership partnership or other relationships are suspected. For example the automated matching process determines whether the Acme Store in New York is the same business entity as the Acme Store in Philadelphia whether variations in the spelling of the word Acme e.g. Acme Acmi Akme Ackme etc. relates to the same entity or different entities or whether Acme Store Acme Corporation and Acme Inc. relate to the same entity or different entities. Such matching is of particular importance when ascertaining credibility for entities with both a digital presence i.e. online presence and an actual presence. For instance offline credit data may be associated with a business entity with the name of Acme Corporation and that same business entity may have online credibility data that is associated with the name of Acme Pizza Shop .

However the matching process may be unable to automatically match some of the credibility data to an entity when there is insufficient information within the tags to find an accurate or suitable match. Unmatched credibility data is stored to the second database . The second database is a temporary storage area that suspends unmatched credibility data until the data is discarded manually matched by owners or manually matched by users in the community .

The interface portal of allows owners and a community of users to become involved in the matching process . In some embodiments the interface portal is a website through which owners gain access to the matching process and the databases and . Through the interface portal owners can claim their accounts and thereafter control matching errors detect identity fraud and monitor the integrity of their credibility score. Specifically owners can identify matching errors in the first database and confirm decline or suggest matches for credibility data that has been suspended to the second database . Through the interface portal owners can address credibility issues in real time. In some embodiments owners include agents or representatives of a business entity that are permitted access to the business entity account in the credibility scoring and reporting system.

In some embodiments the interface portal also provides entities access to the matching process through a plug in. The plug in can be utilized on any website where credibility data is found. In some embodiments the plug in is for external websites that wish to seamlessly integrate the backend of credibility data suppliers to the credibility scoring and reporting system. In this manner an entity can own and manage the review of credibility data itself. This facilitates creation of a single source of credibility across all participating third party websites. Accordingly whenever a user entity in the community or owner spots an incorrect match or issues with credibility data they can interact with that data through the plug in. This allows for community interaction whereby other entities help improve matching results. In so doing review data is transformed into interactive connections of owners users and other entities in the community.

When an improper match is flagged for review or a new match is suggested it is passed to the correction process for verification. In some embodiments the correction process includes automated correction verification and manual correction verification. Automated correction verification can be performed by comparing the flagged credibility data against known entity account information or other credibility data that has been matched to a particular entity. Approved corrections are entered into the first database . Disapproved corrections are ignored.

In some embodiments adjustments may be made to improve the matching accuracy of the matching algorithms in the matching algorithm database based on the approved corrections. In this manner the matching process learns from prior mistakes and makes changes to the algorithms in a manner that improves the accuracy of future matches.

Referring back to the database stores various information pertaining to the credibility scoring of each particular entity using the unique identifier that is assigned to that particular entity. illustrates an exemplary data structure for storing the credibility scoring information. The data structure includes unique identifier contact elements credibility elements and entity elements .

As before the unique identifier uniquely identifies each entity. The contact elements store one or more names addresses identifiers phone numbers email addresses and URLs that identify an entity and that are used to match aggregated and tagged credibility data to a particular entity. The credibility fields store the aggregated and matched qualitative and quantitative credibility data. Additionally the credibility fields may store generated credibility scores and credibility reports that are linked to the unique identifier of the data structure . The entity elements specify business information individual information and relationship information. Business information may include business credit financial information suppliers contractors and other information provided by companies such as Dun Bradstreet. Individual information identifies individuals associated with the business. Relationship information identifies the roles of the individuals in the business and the various business organization or structure. Individual information may be included to assist in the matching process and as factors that affect the credibility score. For example executives with proven records of growing successful businesses can improve the credibility score for a particular business and inexperienced executives or executives that have led failing businesses could detrimentally affect the credibility score of the business.

Logically the database may include the databases and of and other databases referred to in the figures and in this document. Physically the database may include one or more physical storage servers that are located at a single physical location or are distributed across various geographic regions. The storage servers include one or more processors network interfaces for networked communications and volatile and or nonvolatile computer readable storage mediums such as Random Access Memory RAM solid state disk drives or magnetic disk drives.

The reporting engine accesses the database to obtain credibility data from which to derive the credibility scores and credibility reports for various entities. In some embodiments the reporting engine updates previously generated scores and reports when credibility scores and reports for an entity have been previously generated and credibility data has changed or new credibility data is available in the database . illustrates some components of the reporting engine for generating credibility scores and credibility reports in accordance with some embodiments. The reporting engine includes data analyzer natural language processing NLP engine scoring engine scoring filters credibility scoring aggregator and report generator . In some embodiments the reporting engine and its various components are implemented as a set of scripts or machine implemented processes that execute sets of computer instructions.

The data analyzer interfaces with the database in order to obtain aggregated credibility data for one or more entities. As noted above credibility data for a particular entity is stored to the database using a unique identifier. Accordingly the data analyzer is provided with one or a list of unique identifiers for which credibility scores and reports are to be generated. The list of unique identifiers may be provided by a system administrator or may be generated on the fly based on requests that are submitted through the interface portal. The data analyzer uses the unique identifiers to retrieve the associated data from the database .

Once credibility data for a particular entity is retrieved from the database the data analyzer analyzes that credibility data to identify qualitative credibility data from quantitative credibility data. As earlier noted credibility data may include both qualitative and quantitative credibility data. In such cases the data analyzer segments the credibility data to separate the qualitative data portions from the quantitative data portions.

The data analyzer uses pattern matching techniques and character analysis to differentiate the qualitative credibility data from the quantitative credibility data. Qualitative credibility data includes data that is not described in terms of quantities not numerically measured or is subjective. Text based reviews and comments obtained from sites such as www.yelp.com and www.citysearch.com are examples of qualitative data. Accordingly the data analyzer identifies such text based reviews and classifies them as qualitative credibility data. The data analyzer passes identified qualitative data to the NLP engine and the scoring engine for conversion into quantitative measures.

Conversely quantitative data includes data that is described in terms of quantities is quantifiably measured or is objective. A credit score rating or rankings that are confined to a bounded scale 0 5 stars are examples of quantitative data. Accordingly the data analyzer identifies these scores ratings and rankings as quantitative credibility data. The data analyzer passes identified quantitative data to the scoring filters .

In some embodiments the NLP engine performs relationship identification on qualitative credibility data. Specifically the NLP engine identifies relationships between i textual quantifiers and ii modified objects.

In some embodiments a textual quantifier includes adjectives or other words phrases and symbols from which quantitative measures can be derived. This includes words phrases or symbols that connote some degree of positivity or negativity. The following set of words connotes similar meaning albeit with different degrees good very good great excellent and best ever . Textual quantifiers also include adjectives for which different degree equivalents may or may not exist such as helpful knowledgeable respectful courteous expensive broken and forgetful . The above listings are an exemplary set of textual quantifiers and are not intended to be an exhaustive listing. A full listing of textual quantifiers is stored to a database that is accessed by the NLP engine . In this manner the NLP engine can scale to identify new and different textual quantifiers as needed.

In some embodiments a modified object includes words phrases or symbols that pertain to some aspect of an entity and that are modified by one or more textual quantifiers. In other words the modified objects provide context to the textual quantifiers. For example the statement my overall experience at the Acme Store was good but the service was bad contains two textual quantifiers good and bad and two modified objects overall experience and service . The first modified object overall experience is modified by the textual quantifier good . The second modified object service is modified by the textual quantifier bad . In some embodiments a full listing of modified objects is stored in a database that is accessed by the NLP engine. Additionally grammatical rules and other modified object identification rules may be stored to the database and used by the NLP engine to identify the objects that are modified by various textual quantifiers.

The NLP engine passes the matched pairs of textual quantifiers and modified objects to the scoring engine . The scoring engine converts each pair to a quantitative measure. presents a process for deriving quantitative measures from qualitative credibility data in accordance with some embodiments. The process begins when the scoring engine receives from the NLP engine qualitative credibility data with identified pairs of textual quantifiers and modified objects.

The process selects at a first identified textual quantifier and modified object pair. Based on the modified object of the selected pair the process identifies at a quantitative scale of values. In some embodiments the scale of values determines a weight that is attributed to the particular modified object. Some modified objects are weighted more heavily than others in order to have greater impact on the credibility score. For example from the statement my overall experience at the Acme Store was good but the service was bad the modified object overall experience is weighted more heavily than the modified object service because service relates to one aspect of the business credibility whereas overall experience relates to the business credibility as a whole. In some embodiments the process uses the modified object as an index or hash into a table that identifies the corresponding scale of values associated with that modified object.

Next the process maps at the textual quantifier from the identified pair to a particular value in the identified scale of values to derive a quantitative measure. In some embodiments the mapping is performed in conjunction with a conversion formula that outputs a particular value when the textual quantifier and a scale of values are provided as inputs. In some other embodiments the textual quantifier maps to a first value that is then adjusted according to the scale of values identified by the modified object. For example the textual quantifiers good very good great excellent and best ever map to values of 6 7 8 9 and 10 respectively in an unadjusted scale of 0 10. A modified object that is paired with the textual quantifier great may identify a scale of value ranging from 0 100. Accordingly the value associated with the textual quantifier i.e. 8 is adjusted per the identified scale to a value of 80.

The process determines at whether there are other identified textual quantifier and modified object pairs associated with the credibility data. If so the process reverts to step and selects the next pair. Otherwise the process passes at the mapped values along with the associated credibility data to the scoring filters and the process ends.

In some embodiments the reporting engine monitors relationships between quantitative data and qualitative data to promote self learning and adaptive scoring. Credibility data sources often provide a quantitative score that ranks or rates a business on some quantitative scale e.g. 0 5 stars and an associated set of qualitative data that comments on or explains the quantitative score. Based on the relationship between the quantitative data and the qualitative data the reporting engine of some embodiments adaptively adjusts how quantitative measures are derived from qualitative data. Specifically the reporting engine adjusts i the scale of values provided to certain modified objects found in qualitative data and ii the value that is selected in a scale of values for a particular textual quantifier that is associated with a modified object. For example when a quantitative score of 5 out of 5 appears 75 of the time with qualitative data that includes the textual quantifier good and a quantitative score of 3 out of 5 appears 80 of the time with qualitative data that includes the textual quantifier fine then the reporting engine learns from these relationships to increase the quantifiable value for the good textual quantifier and decrease the quantifiable value for the fine textual quantifier.

In some embodiments the reporting engine monitors relationships between the various textual quantifiers and modified objects in the qualitative data to promote self learning and adaptive scoring. Specifically the reporting engine adjusts the scale of values associated with a particular modified object based on the frequency with which that modified object appears in the qualitative data. Similarly the reporting engine can adjust the selected value associated with a particular textual quantifier based on the frequency with which that textual quantifier appears in the qualitative data. These frequency measurement can be made on an individual entity basis on an entity sub classification e.g. fast food restaurant fine dining restaurant and family restaurant or on a field of business basis e.g. restaurants clothing stores and electronic stores . For example when the phrase the food was appears in 75 of user reviews that are associated with a particular business entity and the phrase the waiter was appears in 10 of user reviews that are associated with that particular business entity then the reporting engine can provide greater weight to the scale of values that is associated with the modified object food than the scale of values that is associated with the modified object waiter . In this manner the credibility score derived from the qualitative data can better account for those factors that users frequently comment on while reducing the impact that other rarely mentioned factors have on the credibility score.

In summary the scale of values for certain modified objects and the selected value from the scale of values for the associated textual quantifier can be adaptively adjusted based on the correspondence between quantitative data that is associated with qualitative data and based on the relative frequency that a particular textual quantifier or modified object is used with reference to a particular entity sub classification of an entity or field of business.

In some embodiments the scoring filters filter the quantitative measures and the credibility data before producing the credibility score. In some embodiments the scoring filters include executable processes that incorporate different pattern matching criteria to identify which quantitative measures or which credibility data to filter based on what conditions. Each scoring filter may be specific to one or more types of credibility data. As such the scoring filters are selectively applied to the credibility data based on the type of credibility data.

Next the process uses a set of filters to adjust at inconsistencies in the quantitative measures for the remaining credibility data. For example different reviewers may each give a particular entity a three out of five rating but in the associated comments a first reviewer may provide positive feedback while a second reviewer may provide negative feedback. In such cases filters can be defined to increase the quantitative measure provided by the first reviewer based on the positive feedback and decrease the quantitative measure provided by the second reviewer based on the negative feedback.

The process uses a set of filters to normalize at the quantitative measures for the remaining credibility data. Normalization includes adjusting the scaling of quantitative measures. In some embodiments the quantitative measures for qualitative credibility data that are derived by the scoring engine will not require normalization. However quantitative measures originating from quantitative credibility data may require normalization. For instance quantitative measures of quantitative credibility data obtained from a first data source e.g. www.yelp.com may include a rating that is out of five stars and quantitative measures of quantitative credibility data obtained from a second data source e.g. www.zagat.com may include a point scale of 0 30 points. In some embodiments the process normalizes these quantitative measures to a uniform scale of values e.g. 0 100 . In some other embodiments the process normalizes these quantitative measures with disproportionate weighting such that quantitative measures obtained from credibility data of a more trusted data source are provided more weight than quantitative measures obtained from credibility data of a less trusted data source. Disproportionate weighting is also used to limit the impact stale credibility data has over the credibility score. Specifically quantitative measures from older credibility data are normalized with less weighting than quantitative measure from newer credibility data. Different scoring filters may be defined to implement these and other weighting criteria.

The process stores at the filtered quantitative measures data to the database and the process ends. In some embodiments the process directly passes the filtered quantitative measures to the credibility scoring aggregator of the reporting engine .

The credibility scoring aggregator produces a credibility score for a particular entity based on normalized quantitative measures for that particular entity. In some embodiments the credibility score is a numerical value that is bounded in a range that represents a lack of credibility at one end and full credibility at another end where credibility accounts for successes of various business practices customer satisfaction performance relative to competitors growth potential etc. In some embodiments the credibility score may be encoded to specify different credibility aspects with different digits. For example the first three digits of a six digit score specify a business credit score and the last three digits of the six digit score specify the credibility score. In some embodiments the credibility score is a set of scores with each score representing a different component of credibility. For example the credibility score may comprise a credit score a review score and a rating score where the review score is compiled from quantitative measures derived from the aggregated qualitative data and the rating score is compiled from the normalized quantitative measures within the aggregated quantitative data. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the credibility score can be formatted in any number of other ways such as a set of formatted characters or as a set of formatted alphanumeric characters.

To produce the credibility score the credibility scoring aggregator aggregates any filtered and normalized quantitative measures for a particular entity from the database or from the scoring filters . The credibility scoring aggregator then uses one or more proprietary algorithms to factor together the quantitative measures to produce the credibility score. This may include averaging summing or using proprietary formulas to produce the credibility score from the aggregated set of quantitative measures. These algorithms allow for a credibility score to be computed with any number of available quantitative measures. The produced credibility score is then stored back to the database where it is associated with the particular entity.

From the interface portal of entities can access and view their credibility score. In some embodiments the credibility score is updated and presented in real time. In some embodiments the credibility score is a tangible asset that entities purchase before being provided access to the credibility score. Entities can purchase a onetime viewing of the credibility score or can purchase a subscription plan that allows them to view their credibility score anytime during a particular subscription cycle e.g. monthly yearly etc. . Entities can also purchase access to the credibility scores of other entities that they may be interested in doing business with or to see a competitor s credibility.

The report generator operates in conjunction with the credibility scoring aggregator . In some embodiments the report generator is tasked with 1 producing reports that detail how the credibility of different entities is derived 2 organizing aggregated credibility data derived credibility data and referenced credibility data pertaining to an entity and 3 organizing ancillary data for informative and descriptive identification of the entity. Such data is aggregated by the master data manager . As will be described below credibility data and other ancillary informative or descriptive data may include maps news identification information financial data photos videos social network content and network partnerships associated with the entity. All such data serves as supplemental credibility data that creates a holistic and multi dimensional view of the credibility.

In some embodiments the credibility report is a data structure that is stored to the database of . Organizing the aggregated data includes grouping related credibility data into different datasets that represent different dimensions of credibility. For example grouping qualitative data that is used to derive a review score to a first dataset that represents a first dimension of credibility grouping quantitative credibility data that is used to derive a rating score into a second dataset that represents a second dimension and grouping social network content to a third dataset that represents a third dimension of credibility. In some embodiments a single dataset may be used to represent two or more dimensions of credibility. For example qualitative data grouped to a dataset may be associated with a credibility scoring dimension and a rating dimension.

Instead of storing all data to the data structure of the credibility report some of the data for the credibility report may be obtained on the fly from a data source partner. In such cases the report generator inserts a reference into the creditability report where the reference is a URL hyperlink or other network identifier usable to obtain desired information from the data source partner over a network i.e. Internet . For example the reference may include a URL that links to a map identifying the location of an entity where the map is hosted by a third party mapping service. In some embodiments the reference includes access parameters in addition to the reference in order to obtain particular data from a third party or remote data source. The access parameters may include registration or login information data values queries or inputs to be used with the reference when obtaining information from the third party or remote data source. In the mapping example above the access parameters may include a street address that is passed as part of the URL query string to the third party mapping service. The access parameters may further include scripts e.g. JavaScript that are executed when the remote data source is contacted or when the data is retrieved from the third party or remote data source.

In some embodiments the credibility report is hierarchically structured. In this manner access to the credibility report data can be restricted based on access rights associated with each hierarchical layer. Data grouped to a first hierarchical layer may be accessible by all parties and may include summary or high level information. Data grouped to a second hierarchical layer or lower hierarchical layer may include more restrictive access rights to allow the system operator to monetize the presentation of this data through the interface portal. Access restrictions may be specified by the credibility system operator i.e. interface portal operator the entity to which the data pertains or by a set of defined access restriction rules that enumerate what credibility data is assigned to what access restriction level. For example access restriction rules may be defined whereby the overall credibility score for each entity is assigned a first access restriction level that is accessible by all other entities and component scores e.g. a review credibility score and a rating credibility score are assigned a second access restriction level that is accessible by other entities that paid for greater levels of access.

In some embodiments the report generator provides various interactive tools at different hierarchical layers of the credibility report to allow different entities the ability to edit reorganize or otherwise manage the data that is grouped at that hierarchical layer. The tools may include 1 a graphical element for presentation by the interface portal and interaction with at least a graphical pointing tool or keyboard and 2 an Application Programming Interface API function call sub routine script or system call that implements the tool functionality. Some of these various tools are described below.

Entity identification information such as the name unique identifier e.g. DUNS number employer identification number etc. address etc. is also stored to the credibility report. This information is included so that different query strings and search terms can be used to locate and identify the appropriate credibility report.

Once a credibility report is stored to the database that credibility report can be updated by the report generator as new credibility data becomes available. This may include changing credibility or other data that was previously stored to the credibility report data structure or changing previously stored references or access parameters that are used to obtain data from other data sources. In some embodiments the report generator may generate the credibility reports before they are accessed by entities or the report generator may generate the credibility reports on demand as they are requested by entities.

The credibility reports include sufficient data which when presented through the interface portal provide complete transparency into how the credibility for a particular entity is determined. By providing different presentations of the credibility report according to the hierarchical layers different groupings of data and different access restrictions each credibility report can be monetized differently. More specifically each credibility dimension and each hierarchical layer of credibility data within each credibility dimension can be converted into a tangible asset whose data can be separately monetized or freely distributed on a per entity or per access restriction basis. Entities access the credibility reports through the interface portal though some embodiments present the data in the credibility reports using other mediums such as in writing or by telephone consultation.

As noted above the credibility scores and the data within the credibility reports can be accessed by any entity using the interface portal . The interface portal generates various graphical and interactive interfaces such as a credibility directory or credibility review website based on the credibility reports. These interfaces can be presented using any browser or similar application that executes on a computing system or other electronic device such as a smartphone tablet notebook computer or desktop computer. These interfaces serve as a single point of contact where an entity can obtain credibility information about itself or another entity.

In some embodiments the credibility directory is a searchable interface to the database that stores the generated credibility reports. In other words the credibility directory is a searchable interface from which entities submit queries to identify credibility scores or credibility reports for one or more entities of interest. presents a credibility directory interface in accordance with some embodiments.

As shown in the credibility directory interface is a website that is displayed within a web browser application such as Microsoft s Internet Explorer or Mozilla s Firefox . In some embodiments the credibility directory is a functional component that is part of an overall credibility website. For instance in the interface to the credibility directory is presented near the top of the website as a header field. The header field may be static such that other content within the website may change based on user interactions and the interface to the credibility directory will not. In this manner the credibility directory interface provides an always on and available interface to search for different credibility scores or credibility reports.

The credibility directory interface includes at least a first text field and a second text field to specify search criteria for identifying an entity of interest. The first text field is for receiving primary entity identification information. The primary entity identification information may include a complete or partial entity name phonetic entity name or other identifier such as a DUNS number. The second text field is used to receive various filtering data to better identify the entity entered into the first text field . The filtering data may include addressing telephone numbers URLs and category of trade e.g. restaurant clothing legal services etc. . For example two different business entities may exist with the same entity name but a first such business entity is located in New York and a second such business entity is located in California. By receiving location or geographic filtering data in the second text field the credibility directory can more accurately identify which of the two business entities is desired.

The credibility directory interface passes the combined search criteria that are entered into the first text field and the second text field as a query string to the database . In some embodiments the search criteria are a string of delimited text. For example the primary entity identification information Acme Store and the filtering data Los Angeles is combined to generate the query string that is passed to the database .

The database utilizes the query string to identify zero or more entities and the credibility reports that are associated with the identified entities. When no entities are identified by the query string a message indicating the lack of search results is presented to user submitting the search. When a single entity is identified or when a single entity is identified as matching to the search criteria by a specified threshold percentage the interface portal formats and presents the credibility report to the user as a dynamically generated website. When two or more entities are identified by the query string the identification information for the identified entities name address website URL graphic or icon etc. are passed to the interface portal for presentation as a selectable list to the user. The user can then select a desired entity from the selectable list in order to display the credibility report for the desired entity.

In some embodiments where multiple entities are identified based on the submitted search criteria the interface portal orders the selectable list to present entities based on relevance to the submitted search criteria. In some other embodiments the interface portal orders the selectable list to first present entities that have paid for a higher placement and then present entities that have not paid for a higher placement in the search results. For example in a search is conducted for Pizza within the city of Los Angeles as the filtering data. Certain pizza restaurants can pay the credibility system operator to be listed first when the interface portal displays the search results. As shown in listings are ordered before listings because the entities associated with the listings paid to have their listings be presented first. In some embodiments the paid listings are delineated from the non paid listings using bordering shading coloring or other graphical demarcation.

Having a paid listing for a particular entity increases the exposure of that particular entity to others. In so doing more individuals and businesses become familiar with the credibility of that particular entity ultimately bringing more clientele to the particular entity when the credibility is sufficiently good. In some embodiments the paid listings identify entities that were not returned as part of the user submitted query string but that are related to the conducted search. For example a search may be conducted for Pizza but one or more of the paid listings can be related to Italian restaurants.

As noted above the interface portal dynamically generates a website for each entity based on the credibility report for that entity. This website is generated irrespective of whether the entity operates its own website on a different domain at a different URL or whether the entity has any online presence whatsoever. In this manner the interface portal provides a central location from which any entity can view information specifically credibility data about any other entity without the entities having to incur the time expense and overhead in developing and maintaining that website. Moreover many small businesses do not have the resources necessary to develop and maintain a website or a virtual store front. By allowing each particular business owner the ability 1 to take ownership of a dynamically generated website that corresponds to that particular business and 2 to modify some of the presented content therein the interface portal removes various barriers that prevent small businesses from expanding their reach thereby providing more equal opportunity for the small business to compete with larger businesses.

All such websites may be accessed from a single domain. In some embodiments www.credibility.com serves as a URL from which to access the credibility directory and subsequently the generated credibility websites for different entities. The interface portal may address each entity website by appending different pathnames to the URL. For example www.credibility.com AcmeStore 1234 may be used to address the website for a particular entity named Acme Store where the delimiter is followed by the unique identifier for a particular Acme Store. In some other embodiments different addressing formats may be used to access the different dynamically generated websites.

Each particular entity website is dynamically generated based on credibility data from the credibility report that is associated with the particular entity. As earlier noted the credibility data in each credibility report is aggregated from multiple different data sources such that the generated website provides a holistic and multi dimensional view of the particular entity s credibility. In some embodiments a first dimension of credibility is based on a credibility score derived from qualitative and quantitative credibility data a second dimension of credibility is based on maps showing the entity s location a third dimension of credibility is based on historical news about the entity a fourth dimension of credibility is based on financial data about the entity a fifth dimension of credibility is based on partners of the entity a sixth dimension is based on social network feeds about the entity a seventh dimension is based on comparative credibility analysis with other related entities. The credibility report for each entity includes at least two or more of these dimensions. Each dimension of credibility may further include one or more sub dimensions. Each child sub dimension for a parent dimension provides additional detail in the form of more granular credibility data or different groupings of credibility data from which the parent dimension of credibility is derived. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the holistic view of entity credibility presented using the credibility system of some embodiments may be based on other dimensions in addition to or instead of the above enumerated dimensions.

The interface portal therefore automatically generates websites that are unlike the websites that are generated by individual data sources such as www.yelp.com and www.citysearch.com wherein these websites provide a limited and partial view of an entity s credibility based on limited credibility data that was created on that particular site from user reviews or user ratings submitted to that particular site . Conversely the websites generated by the interface portal provide a holistic view of entity credibility by factoring in credibility data from multiple independent data sources with each data source providing one or more dimensions of credibility thereby partially contributing to the overall derived credibility.

Moreover some embodiments utilize one dimension of credibility to adjust another dimension of credibility. For example the overall credibility score derived by the systems and methods described herein is a score that derived not only from quantitative data but also qualitative data. This is unlike other credibility sites such as www.yelp.com that provide a quantitative score and qualitative data where the quantitative score may be subjectively assigned by the submitting user with little direct derivation from the qualitative data. For example a reviewer may provide a one out of five rating but in the qualitative comments state that everything was great except shipping was slow . As a result the score and the qualitative data can be inconsistent on sites such as www.yelp.com and thereby confuse or mislead the user as to the actual credibility of the entity. The holistic presentation by the credibility interface portal inherently avoids any such inconsistencies as the qualitative data is a credibility dimension used in conjunction with the quantitative data when deriving the overall credibility score. Additionally the holistic presentation prevents biased or abnormal credibility data from a single data source from having a disproportionate impact to the overall entity credibility. For example a single reviewer that contributes to a particular data source can write multiple bad reviews about a particular entity thereby having a disproportionate impact on the credibility of that particular entity at that particular data source. By diversifying the derivation of entity credibility over multiple different data sources the integrity of the credibility score and credibility data in the credibility reports is maintained. This also prevents any single data source from having complete control over the derived credibility. For example an entity or data source is unable to populate its own site with only positive reviews while hiding negative reviews.

In some embodiments the interface portal generates each dynamic website to conform to a shared structure. This promotes a degree of uniformity between the dynamically generated websites for different entities. The same or similar credibility data that is found on a website for a first entity can be found at or near a similar location on a different website for a second entity. Consequently users spend less time having to search for desired content on the websites.

To dynamically generate the websites based on the credibility reports the interface portal includes a content management system CMS . presents a process performed by the CMS of the interface portal to dynamically generate the websites in accordance with some embodiments. The process begins by obtaining at a credibility report. In some embodiments the CMS obtains the credibility report from the database when requests are submitted using the credibility directory interface. The CMS is capable of obtaining multiple credibility reports in parallel based on different user submitted queries where each credibility report is presented to the appropriate user in a different dynamically generated website.

The process parses at the obtained credibility report to extract relevant credibility data from the credibility report. This includes extracting summary information about the various dimensions of credibility and about the different components of credibility data that are used to derive the overall credibility score. Such information may be delimited in the credibility report with specific delimiters such as Extensible Markup Language XML tags. Other data within the credibility report can be ignored or presented in hierarchical layers via drill down functionality slider tools etc. In some embodiments extraction involves some degree of processing whereby the credibility data in the credibility report is processed in order to derive the summary information. For example when the extracted data includes a set of scores these scores may be processed to compute a single score that represents the set of scores.

The process formats at the extracted information for display as a website. In some embodiments formatting includes defining HyperText Markup Language HTML tags to present the extracted information according to a specified structure. Formatting may also include transforming extracted information to make the data presentable in the website. For example converting a numeric value into a graphical representation such as a dial indicator or converting an image to the appropriate size and file type. Formatting may also include providing access restrictions to some data and not other data. The process passes at the generated website to the requesting user and the process ends. In some embodiments passing the website includes passing HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP packets e.g. POST packets from the interface portal over a network to a client browser application.

The entity identification information in the header field is comprised of a set of fields that present the name address telephone number company website categorization information and other information to uniquely identify the entity. In some embodiments the categorization information specifies a field of business that the entity operates in for example electronics retail automobile mechanic or restaurant. The categories may include one or more sub categories to further refine the field of business. For example when the entity is categorized as a restaurant a first sub category can define the entity as a fast food restaurant family restaurant or fine dining restaurant and a second sub category can define the type of food such as American French Asian Mexican etc. In some embodiments the entity identification information can be pulled directly from the credibility report. In some other embodiments the credibility report stores some or all of the entity identification information as a set of links These links reference the actual entity identification information that is stored on one or more data sources and that is obtained through established partnership feeds with those data sources. For example the categorization information may be obtained by accessing a Dun Bradstreet database using a DUNs number that uniquely identifies an entity.

In some embodiments the data report field presents credibility scoring such as an overall credibility score and or component scores such as a rating score and a review score used in the overall derivation of the credibility score. These scores summarize the credibility of an entity using one or more readily identifiable values that are derived based on credibility data including quantitative and qualitative data that are aggregated from the multiple data sources.

In some embodiments the data report field further presents creditworthiness data not shown in such as credit information. This information can be directly pulled from the credibility report or can be obtained through links in the credibility report that reference established partnership feeds with other data sources such as Dun Bradstreet Experian TransUnion etc. that host the credit information.

In some embodiments the data report field further presents multimedia geographic information to supplement the holistic credibility view of the entity. The multimedia geographic information presents an actual image or video of a business entity storefront. More specifically the multimedia geographic information presents a street view image of the storefront that is static or an image that spans up to 360 degrees. Alternatively a video may be presented to show recorded or live feeds of the business entity. The multimedia geographic information allows users to visually ascertain the condition of the business entity e.g. rundown clean well lit etc. the area in which the business entity is located the street location and whether the business entity actually exists. In many cases these factors affect whether or not potential clientele will make the trip to one entity or another. These factors therefore contribute to the overall credibility of the entity. In some embodiments the multimedia geographic information is stored and pulled directly from the credibility report. In some other embodiments the credibility report contains reference links from which the multimedia geographic information is obtained using established partnership feeds with data sources such as Google Maps or Google Earth. The obtained images or videos are formatted for proper presentation in the website.

In some embodiments the data report field further presents a partnership network that visually identifies partnerships of the entity. This includes first and second degree partners that are suppliers purchasers manufacturers financiers clients and friends of the entity. Such information supplements the overall holistic credibility view of the entity by identifying who are the entity s primary and secondary contacts. Specifically when partners of a first business entity include Fortune companies and partners of a second business entity include financially unstable companies then one can quickly and readily ascertain that the first business entity has better credibility than the second business entity and it is thus safer to engage in a transaction with the first business entity. Moreover one can identify from these partnerships the source of goods and whether the components of the goods being sold are from high quality trusted partners or unreliable low end partners. The partnership network data can be stored locally to the credibility system database or can be obtained remotely from one or more data sources such as www.linkedin.com.

In some embodiments the data report field further presents social network feeds to provide a continuous and real time feed as to what others are saying about an entity and what the entity is saying about itself. Others can report recent positive and negative experiences with the entity and in so doing provide a real time account of the entity s credibility. Consequently the entity is forced to stay vigilant and responsive to client experiences. Otherwise a number of negative reviews in a relative short time span can detrimentally affect the credibility of the entity causing other potential clientele to go elsewhere. Similarly a sufficient number of positive reviews in a relative short time span can improve the credibility of the entity and as a result sway potential clientele to the entity.

The entity can also leverage the social network feeds to have a real time medium with which to report recent improvements changes upgrades or promotions to potential clientele. In this manner the entity is provided its own medium with which to improve upon its credibility. In some embodiments the social network feeds are obtained from partnerships with data sources such as www.twitter.com and www.facebook.com. Accordingly links and any necessary login information associated with accessing tweets or facebook status updates for a particular entity are incorporated into the appropriate credibility reports that are then used to populate the dynamically generated websites with the social network feeds . Additional social network feeds may be generated locally using the interface portal. In some such embodiments entities do not have to use third party services such as www.twitter.com to submit status updates. In some embodiments social network feeds are aggregated from multiple different data sources including local data sources and are presented in a scrolling message box of the dynamically generated website.

When the social network feeds are combined with the other data described above the dynamically generated credibility websites provide a holistic and comprehensive view of an entity s credibility. In some embodiments these websites are referred to as credibility review sites because of the ability to view at one time and on one screen different dimensions affecting an entity s overall credibility where each dimension is a compilation of quantitative credibility data qualitative credibility data and other related credibility data from multiple data sources that factor in some aspect to the credibility of the entity. In light of the foregoing description it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the credibility review websites can include additional dimensions of credibility data in addition to or instead of those described above.

Other credibility sites currently in the art such as www.yelp.com www.citysearch.com www.twitter.com and the like provide an isolated one dimensional view of the business credibility. As a result credibility ascertained from these other sites is subject to rapid fluctuation subject to inconsistencies biased data and insufficient data thereby providing an incomplete and single dimensional view of the credibility as opposed to the holistic and comprehensive view provided by the credibility system of some embodiments.

Moreover the dynamically generated credibility review websites provide each corresponding entity with an online presence without that entity spending the time and resources to develop that online presence. In some embodiments management and editing functionality of the credibility review websites is provided to the corresponding entity. Specifically an entity can contribute to its respective website by supplementing the website with additional credibility data or by identifying invalid or mismatched credibility data that should be corrected. Customizations are stored to the appropriate credibility report data structure such that subsequent presentation of the credibility review website will incorporate the entity submitted customizations. Customization functionality can be provided as a free service or as a pay service. In some embodiments the entity is limited in the information that it can modify or add in order to preserve the integrity of the credibility data that is presented. For example the entity can provide a personalized description of itself its services its goods etc. that are incorporated and used instead of the default header field . Additionally the entity can supplement the multimedia geographic data with a live in store video feed or more up to date photos of the entity. To preserve the integrity of the credibility data the entity can report mismatched credibility data. However the entity will be unable to remove the data without prior approval by a system administrator.

To customize its respective credibility review website the entity first claims the website by registering with the credibility system to confirm that it is the entity that owns the website that is being claimed. During registration the entity is authenticated to ensure that it is who it claims to be. Thereafter the entity is provided access to controls that allow the entity to supplement or change the dynamically generated website of some embodiments. The changes are stored to the credibility report data structure such that subsequent viewing of the website for that particular entity will include the entity submitted changes.

Rather than present the credibility data in the credibility review format described above with reference to some embodiments of the interface portal partition and present each dimension affecting the overall credibility of an entity in different interactive stateful graphical elements referred to hereafter as credibility modules . Each dimension of credibility that is represented by a credibility module is derived from a filtered subset of the credibility data that is aggregated from the various data sources and that is processed by the credibility system. In some embodiments the credibility modules include an overall credibility module a social media credibility module a reviews credibility module and a network credibility module.

The overall credibility module presents a summarized overview for the derivation of an entity s credibility and also provides drill down functions to access different components composed of related groups of credibility data for detailing the derivation of the overall credibility. The social media credibility module focuses on the affect that social media has on an entity s credibility. In some embodiments the social media credibility module provides a single location for monitoring credibility data that is obtained from social media sites. Drill down functionality details the impact that different sets of social media related credibility data have on the social media dimension of an entity s credibility. The social media credibility module is primarily composed of qualitative credibility data that is aggregated by the credibility system. The reviews credibility module focuses on the affect that review sites have on an entity s credibility wherein review sites differ from social media sites on the basis of the primary usage of the sites. Specifically review sites such as Yelp CitySearch and the like primarily serve to aggregate knowledge about different entities based on experiences that others have had with those entities. Social media sites such as Facebook Google and LinkedIn primarily serve as communication platforms that facilitate communication between different entities. Drill down functionality details the impact that different sets of review related credibility data have on the review dimension of an entity s credibility. In some embodiments the reviews credibility module provides an aggregate of user reviews and blog posts and is primarily composed of quantitative credibility data that is aggregated by the credibility system. The network credibility module focuses on the affect that online networking has on an entity s credibility. Drill down functionality of this module enables business to business social networking for credibility reference partnership formation and lead generation. This module is primarily composed of supplemental credibility data that is aggregated by the credibility system. Collectively these credibility modules holistically convey the overall credibility for an entity in a modular interactive fashion. It should be apparent that additional or alternative credibility modules may be presented through the interface portal.

Each credibility module is a software construct such as an application script etc. Each credibility module hierarchically arranges the credibility data that is used to derive a particular credibility dimension and graphically presents that credibility data with drill down functionality to expose the different hierarchically arranged sets of the credibility data in an on demand manner. The hierarchically arranged sets of credibility data are hereinafter referred to as different hierarchical layers. In this manner an entity can better understand the derivation of overall credibility by visualizing each dimension affecting the overall credibility separately and by obtaining detailed credibility data for each such dimension as desired. Moreover an entity can more easily understand its credibility by initially being provided 1 with a high level overview of its credibility and 2 with tools that allow the entity to drill down into a particular dimension of credibility in order to obtain more detailed credibility data used in the derivation of that particular dimension of credibility. In this manner the credibility modules provide an intuitive means to navigate through an entity s credibility such that the entity s credibility can be understood in its simplest form or at varying degrees of complexity depending on user interactions with these interactive stateful graphical elements. Moreover since each credibility module provides a different dimension of credibility and the collective set of credibility modules present credibility data that is aggregated from several different data sources one can ascertain a complete and holistic understanding of the credibility for an entity from a single website whereas before one would have to piece together this understanding by accessing each of the disparate data sources separately.

Zero or more graphical interactive elements are associated with each of credibility modules and presented at various hierarchical layers of the credibility modules. These interactive elements allow entities to interact with the credibility data in other ways besides accessing different drill down hierarchical layers. Specifically these interactive elements may be used to sort organize or manipulate the presented credibility data.

The credibility data associated with each hierarchical layer of each credibility module is stored in the credibility report. In some embodiments the credibility report is formatted with various delimiters that identify which set of credibility data corresponds with which drill down hierarchical layer of which credibility module. For example the credibility report may be formatted with the following delimiter tags 

In the above example each delimited set is denoted by the respective and pair. The first delimited pair identifies which credibility module the underlying credibility data is associated with. As shown there are multiple first hierarchical layers e.g. Score Visualization Updates and Actions with credibility data that is presented when the associated credibility module is opened. From the Score first hierarchical layer a user can access two different second hierarchical layers identified as SentimentScore and PresenceScore . Each of these second hierarchical layers is associated with some presentable credibility data. Furthermore when the SentimentScore hierarchical layer is accessed the user will have the ability to drill down further into a third hierarchical layer identified as QuantScore that includes additional credibility data for explaining or providing more detail to the credibility data presented in the preceding hierarchical layer.

The above data structure is presented for exemplary purposes to describe a possible data structure for the credibility report and for how the credibility data in the credibility score is accessed by the interface portal for presentation through the various credibility modules of some embodiments. Therefore it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that other data structure formats may similarly be used for storing the credibility data in the credibility reports and for associating that data with the various credibility modules.

In some embodiments the drill down hierarchical layers of the credibility report allow the credibility system operator a means with which to monetize the credibility data in the credibility reports. For example the credibility data at a first drill down hierarchical layer may be presented to any entity or user free of charge but each drill down layer that is accessible from that first drill down hierarchical layer may require an access fee that the entity or user pays in order to access the credibility data at that drill down hierarchical layer. To facilitate such pay per access functionality the delimiters in the credibility report of some embodiments are modified with various parameters that specify the accessibility to the underlying data. For example the delimiter may be modified to where the Access X parameter and parameter value determines who is permitted access to the underlying credibility data free of charge or whether the underlying data is accessible on a pay per access basis to those that purchase additional access permissions. In addition to or instead of pay per access some embodiments provide subscription services that permit different entities with different subscriptions access to different hierarchical layers. For example a first entity with a first subscription may be permitted access to a drill down layer that provides detailed information about the derivation of a sentiment score and a presence score but is unable to access additional drill down layers. A second entity with a second subscription may be permitted to drill down beyond the detailed information about the derivation of the sentiment score and the presence score in order to view the aggregated quantitative and qualitative credibility data used to derive the sentiment score and the presence score.

By restricting access to the various hierarchical layers of the credibility reports the credibility system operator can by association monetize the access to the credibility data in the various hierarchical layers of the credibility modules. presents a process performed by the interface portal of the credibility system to monetize access to the credibility data in accordance with some embodiments. The process is performed when a credibility report is first accessed and when a credibility module is interacted with. The process identifies at an entity requested level of access. The request is based on the entity interacting with a credibility module whereby the interactions include accessing the credibility module or different hierarchical layers of credibility data within the credibility module. Based on the request the process parses at the credibility report to identify the tags and credibility data that is associated with the requested level of access.

The process determines at the access permissions required to access the requested data based on the parsed tags and data. Next the process identifies at the entity s access permissions from the entity request. In some embodiments each entity request is submitted along with entity identification information so that system access can be logged and monitored. When the entity s access permissions are sufficient at to access the requested data the data is formatted and presented at to the entity. Otherwise a prompt is presented at to the entity indicating the lack of access rights and providing links whereby the entity can pay to acquire the necessary access permissions.

In addition to purchasing access to the credibility data some embodiments of the credibility system can also be monetized by enhancing an entity s control over the credibility modules that contain credibility data for that entity. Specifically the entity can pay to upgrade or enhance one or more such credibility modules. In some embodiments the credibility modules or credibility review websites for different entities exist in one of three states unclaimed basic or enhanced. The unclaimed state applies to credibility modules and credibility review websites that the appropriate entities have not taken ownership of. The basic state applies to credibility modules and credibility review websites that the appropriate entities have taken ownership of but that have not paid for the capabilities to upgrade or enhance the associated credibility data. The enhanced state applies to credibility modules and credibility review websites that the appropriate entities have taken ownership of and for which fees have been paid in order to allow those entities the ability to upgrade or enhance the associated credibility data.

Specifically the basic state and the enhanced state apply to entities that have registered with the credibility system. Once verified login credentials are selected by the entity or are provided to the entity by the credibility system. At this time the entity can also specify the access permissions it desires. Different access permission packages may be purchased. In one access permission package the entity can obtain rights to enhance all application cubes associated with that entity. In other access permission packages the entity can obtain rights to enhance individual application cubes. Certain credibility modules can be bundled together in different packages to lower the cost of purchasing access permissions to a desired set of credibility modules that the entity wishes to enhance or manage. Entities can at any time upgrade or downgrade their access permissions.

In some embodiments enhancement of a credibility module by an entity involves altering the default presentation of the credibility data for that credibility module to create a custom presentation that is more preferable. Enhancements further include automatically identifying and providing the entity with suggestions on how to improve its credibility based on the credibility data that has been aggregated for that entity. Such enhancements may be provided in conjunction with various concierge services. These concierge services can provide suggestions on how an entity can improve its credibility provide consulting or analysis regarding the credibility of the entity or promote the entity by increasing the exposure of the entity. In some embodiments different concierge services are available based on the access permissions obtained by the entity. For example an entity can pay to obtain a first access permission that allows the entity to speak with a consultant that identifies areas where the credibility of the entity is weak. The entity can also pay to obtain a second access permission whereby the consultant takes over and manages the credibility for the entity by making necessary changes that can help to improve the credibility of that entity. Enhancements further include providing the entity with the ability to directly respond to presented credibility data including the ability to reply to a third party review and retweet a Twitter tweet. Enhancements further include the ability to modify the presented credibility data whereby some negative content mismatched biased or other incorrect data may be hidden. Other enhancements include the ability to insert custom credibility data or other data. For example the entity can supplement the credibility report content with graphics images videos live in store feeds identification information promotions etc. Still other enhancements include the ability to connect obtain contact information such as email addresses with other related entities and form new partnerships with those entities.

In the overall credibility module is selected. Accordingly the body of the website is populated with four panes and that summarize the overall credibility for a particular entity. As with each credibility module of the set of credibility modules the first pane is a score pane the second pane is a visualization pane the third pane is an updates pane and the fourth pane is an actions pane.

For the overall credibility module the score pane presents the overall credibility score and various component scores that derive the credibility score for the particular entity. As shown in the component scores includes a sentiment score a presence score and an engagement score. The overall credibility score and the component scores are each derived based on the full complement of credibility data that is aggregated for the entity identified in the interface portal. In some embodiments the sentiment score quantifies how the entity is viewed by others based on the positivity or negativity expressed in the credibility data that is aggregated for the entity. In some embodiments the presence score is derived based on the particular entity s social media and credibility directory review site listings. In some embodiments the engagement score is derived based on the particular entity s social media reach and frequency. Each component score is derived and determined from the aggregated credibility data and other supplemental credibility data that can be aggregated from the data sources. Each component score factors into the derivation of the overall credibility score. In the score pane also presents a change or delta for each component score to illustrate the change in that component score over a specified duration e.g. past thirty days .

For the overall credibility module the visualization pane presents a chart for displaying trending of the various component scores over time. In some embodiments the visualization pane includes interactive elements that allow the user to select the time period for the chart e.g. last thirty days last three months and last six months .

For the overall credibility module the updates pane presents an up to date or most recent aggregate feed of credibility data affecting the selected dimension of entity credibility. Since the selected credibility module of is the overall credibility module the updates pane includes any relevant aggregated credibility data affecting the overall credibility of the entity. The updates pane may therefore interchangeably display a relevant Twitter tweet a Facebook post and a Yelp review. This pane allows one to see the latest credibility data that is aggregated for a particular entity irrespective of which data source that credibility data is first posted to. Accordingly the particular entity need not access different data sources in order to obtain this information.

For the overall credibility module the actions pane presents a prioritized coaching or list of suggested actions that an entity can perform to improve its credibility. Since the selected credibility module of is the overall credibility module the actions pane includes actions that can impact different dimensions of credibility but that nevertheless impact the overall credibility. These suggested actions are automatically determined from the processing of the aggregated credibility data.

Each of the panes and further includes one or more interactive elements that when invoked drill down to a second lower hierarchical layer of credibility data. For example the first pane includes interactive element for accessing a second hierarchical layer of credibility data detailing the derivation of the component scores the second pane includes interactive element for accessing a second hierarchical layer of credibility data for providing additional information with regards to the trending data of the first hierarchical layer the third pane includes interactive element for accessing a second hierarchical layer of credibility data providing additional credibility data from the aggregated feeds and the fourth pane includes interactive element for accessing a second hierarchical layer of credibility data providing additional actions for improving the overall credibility of the particular entity. In some embodiments the same or different second hierarchical layers can be accessed by directly interacting with the credibility data that is presented in the first hierarchical layers. For example one can click on the sentiment component score in the first pane to access credibility data that details the derivation of the sentiment component score. Similarly one can click on a particular suggested action in the fourth pane to access instructions for how to execute the suggested action.

For the sentiment component score the drill down layer presents 1 a social sentiment 2 a reviews sentiment and 3 a network sentiment that collectively derive the sentiment component score . The social sentiment or reviews component score is derived from the total number of social media mentions that the particular entity receives over a specified period of time. A count displays the number of social media mentions during the specified period of time and a visual indicator displays what percentage of those mentions are positive and what percentage of those mentions are negative. The social sentiment is derived from the natural language processing of the aggregated qualitative credibility data as was earlier described.

The reviews sentiment or rating component score is derived from the total number of ratings for the particular entity. An overall rating displays the average rating from the aggregated ratings a first count specifies the number of ratings used to derive the reviews sentiment a second count specifies the number of data sources from which the ratings were aggregated and a chart displays the distribution of the ratings. The reviews sentiment is derived from the processing of the aggregated quantitative credibility data.

In some embodiments the network sentiment is an optional component score that is derived based on the number of requested social media connections of the particular entity. Specifically this component score is determined based on the quality of the partnerships and partners established by the particular entity. The more trusted the partners are and the greater the number of trust partners the higher the score for the network sentiment . In some embodiments the connection information is collected by the master data manager of the credibility system and each of identified connection is then compared to a entity database such as the one maintained by Dun Bradstreet to determine the network sentiment contribution by the identified partner.

Each of the social sentiment review sentiment and network sentiment are expandable and collapsible so that a user can at any time view a certain set of credibility data while hiding other credibility data from view. In this manner the user can pinpoint which sentiment component is most beneficial to the sentiment score and which sentiment component is most detrimental to the sentiment score.

For the presence component score the drill down layer presents 1 a social presence 2 a reviews site presence and 3 a network presence that collectively derive the presence component score . The social presence is based on the ease with which those evaluating the particular entity can find the particular entity on social networks. Accordingly the social presence is derived based on the ratio of the particular entity s established social networking presence to the relevant potential for that particular entity. In some embodiments the social presence is determined based on the number of social media accounts that are identified as being registered to the particular entity. The credibility system may automatically identify these accounts by using the identification information for the particular entity to query different social media sites to determine if an account is identified as matching to the identification information by a specified degree. Alternatively the credibility system may acquire such information from the particular entity itself once the particular entity claims ownership of the website and provides the account information to the credibility system. In some embodiments the social presence presents one or more actions that the particular entity can take to improve its social presence score. For example the social presence may request that the particular entity identify the accounts that it has registered at various social media sites and to register accounts at social media sites that the entity has not yet registered with.

The reviews site presence is based on the ease with which those evaluating the particular entity can find the particular entity on social networks. Accordingly the social presence is derived based on the ease with which those evaluating the particular entity can find the particular entity on credible directories e.g. Google Places and review sites e.g. Yelp . Such information can be aggregated by the master data manager or can be requested from the particular entity. Additionally suggestions may be made for the particular entity to register accounts at various directories.

The network presence is determined from the number of inbound connection request that the particular entity receives during a specified period. Such information may be aggregated directly from different social media sites by leveraging established partnerships with those sites. In some embodiments the strength or reputations of the connections are also weighted to determine the network presence .

Each of the social presence review presence and network presence are expandable and collapsible so that a user can at any time view a certain set of credibility data while hiding other from view. In this manner the user can pinpoint which presence component is most beneficial to the presence score and which presence component is most detrimental to the presence score.

For the engagement component score the drill down layer presents 1 a social engagement and 2 a network engagement that collectively derive the engagement component score . The social engagement is determined form the followership or reach that the particular entity has built through social media. This includes for example the number of Twitter followers and Facebook likes that the particular entity has obtained. Such information is aggregated from the social media sites by the credibility system based on established partnerships with the social media sites.

The network engagement is determined from the number of invitations to connect that the particular entity sends from its various social media accounts. In some embodiments the network engagement is weighted based on the influence of the entities that receive the sent invitations.

From the various component scores and from the additional credibility data that can be obtained via the drill down functionality the understanding of an entity s credibility is simplified and made available in an on demand basis where the drill down functionality reveals more detailed credibility data that than what was presented in an above layer above. Moreover the interface portal presents the credibility of an entity comprehensively such that a viewer need not access different data sources in order to piece together the entity s credibility and the derivation of the credibility score is laid out in an easy to understand interactive manner that does not overwhelm the viewer with too much or too little credibility data rather the viewer controls what credibility data it wants to see and the degree of detail it wants for that credibility data.

In some embodiments the credibility system automatically determines the set of recommended actions that the entity can undertake to improve its credibility score by comparing and identifying differences in the credibility data that is aggregated for the entity and the credibility data that is aggregated for other entities and or by comparing the aggregated credibility data for the entity with a set of rules specified for the credibility system. For example the set of rules may enumerate a list of social media sites that the entity can register with and the credibility system identifies which of the list of social media sites the entity is registered with based on analysis of the credibility data that is aggregated for that entity. Specifically when an item of credibility data identifies an account of the entity at a particular social media site then the credibility system determines that the entity has an account registered at that particular social media site.

With reference back to when the social media credibility module is selected i.e. given focus the display of the website changes to present the social media dimension affecting the credibility of a particular entity. Unlike the credibility data that is presented with the overall credibility module the social media module contains a filtered subset of the credibility data that is aggregated for the particular entity. The filtered subset includes the credibility data that is pertinent to the social media dimension of credibility. This allows the viewer to focus in on and better understand one specific dimension of credibility as opposed to all dimensions that factor into the overall credibility. In this case the specific dimension of credibility relates to the credibility impact of social media. From this credibility dimension an entity can identify what past actions across social media have positively affected its credibility what past actions across social media have negatively affected its credibility and what future actions can be performed or changes can be made in order to improve its credibility across social media. The social media dimension of credibility relates mainly to the qualitative credibility data that is aggregated by the credibility system and factors 1 the sentiment of aggregated social media messages that target or reference a particular entity 2 the presence of the particular entity across social media based on the quantity of aggregated social media messages i.e. qualitative credibility data such as Twitter tweets and Facebook posts that mention the particular entity and 3 the engagement or influence of the particular entity across social media based on the particular entity s involvement in networking.

As with the overall credibility and other dimensions of credibility the interface portal presents the social media dimension through a set of hierarchical layers. presents the topmost hierarchical layer or first layer for the social media credibility module when the social media credibility module is selected in accordance with some embodiments. Like the topmost layer of the overall credibility module the topmost layer of the social media credibility module includes a score pane a visualization pane an updates pane and an actions pane . However each of the panes presents credibility data that affects or otherwise pertains to the social media dimension of credibility as opposed to presenting credibility data that affects other dimensions of credibility. Each of the panes also includes drill down functionality that can be used to access additional credibility data for detailing the derivation of the credibility data that is presented in the panes .

The score pane presents various subcomponent scores from which a component credibility score for the social media dimension of an entity s credibility is derived. The component scores presented in the score pane differ from those presented in the score pane of in that the aggregated credibility data used to derive the component scores of pane are filtered to include credibility data that is aggregated from social media sites such as Twitter Facebook and Google while excluding credibility data that is aggregated from review sites and other data sources such as Yelp and CitySearch. The component scores include a social media sentiment score a social media presence score and a social media engagement score that convey the volume and sentiment of mentions about the entity across social media.

The visualization pane presents a chart for displaying trending of the various social media component scores over time. In some embodiments the second pane includes interactive elements that allow the user to select the time period for the chart e.g. last thirty days last three months and last six months .

The updates pane presents the most recent set of social media messages that the entity is a target or subject of. Accordingly the updates pane may interchangeably display a relevant Twitter tweet a Facebook post and a Google review that mention target or otherwise reference the entity as the subject of such messages. The updates pane therefore provides a single location from which all social messages about the entity can be viewed without the need to individually access each social media site where one such message is posted.

The actions pane presents a prioritized list of suggested actions that the entity can perform across social media in order to improve its credibility. The list of suggested actions is automatically determined by the credibility system based on the aggregated social media credibility data. The list of suggested actions can include actions such as establishing a presence at a social media site that the entity has yet to register with completing or updating a profile that is otherwise incomplete or out of date at a social media site performing some specified action e.g. posting messages distributing promotional or information materials etc. at a social media site. The list of suggested actions provides the entity with discrete and proven effective methods that others have used to improve their credibility across social media. This provides various advantages over traditional social media sites where the entity would have to guess or determine for itself what actions it should perform in order to improve its credibility across social media. By removing this guesswork and analysis from the entity the interface portal allows the entity to more effectively and quickly improve the social media dimension of its credibility.

Each of the panes further includes one or more interactive elements that when invoked drill down to a second lower hierarchical layer of credibility data. presents the hierarchical layer of credibility data that is accessed from and that presents more detailed credibility data relating to the score pane . presents the hierarchical layer of credibility data that is accessed from and that presents more detailed credibility data relating to the visualization pane . presents the hierarchical layer of credibility data that is accessed from and that presents more detailed credibility data relating to the updates pane . presents the hierarchical layer of credibility data that is accessed from and that presents more detailed credibility data relating to the actions pane .

In some embodiments the sentiment social media component score is derived based on the number of times the entity is mentioned across different social media sites. Also affecting this component score is the sentiment expressed in the mentions. The credibility system derives this component score by filtering the aggregated credibility data to obtain a subset of credibility data that includes social media messages that target or otherwise reference the entity. The credibility system then counts the number of messages in the filtered subset of credibility data and performs the above described natural language processing in order to ascertain the sentiment expressed in the mentions. Such data is then compiled into the social media component score .

In some embodiments the presence social media component score identifies the overall presence that the entity has across social media. The overall presence is determined based on the number of social media sites the entity has an active registered account. The credibility system maintains a list of social media sites that impact the presence social media component score and the credibility system analyzes the aggregated credibility data to identify which social media sites the entity originates messages from. In some embodiments the credibility system automatically identifies accounts at different social media sites that the entity has registered by matching account information in the aggregated credibility data to identification information that is obtained for the entity. In some embodiments the credibility system requests that the entity identify accounts that it has registered at various social media sites.

In some embodiments the engagement social media component score is derived based on the responsiveness of the entity with reference to social media messages that target or reference the entity. As one example this includes the ratio with which the entity responds to Twitter tweets that tag the entity and that originate from one of the entity s followers. In some embodiments the engagement social media component score is derived based on the activity of an entity across social media which includes quantifying the number of association requests and the success rate of the association requests across social media wherein an association request includes for example social media friend networking or partnership requests. More specifically associations can include Facebook friends Twitter followers and LinkedIn connections. In some embodiments the engagement social media component score further factors the influence or reach the entity has across social media based on the number and influence of other entities that are in some way associated e.g. friends networked partners etc. with the entity of interest across social media. An influential entity is one that has a well respected brand or name. Additionally or alternatively the credibility system may derive the engagement social media component score by identifying the set social media messages that target or reference the entity from the aggregated credibility data. Next the credibility system identifies the influence and number of the different entities that originate the messages in the identified set of social media messages. Based on the number of messages and the influence of the message originators the credibility systems computes the engagement social media component score .

With reference back to when the reviews credibility module is selected i.e. given focus the display of the website changes to present the reviews dimension affecting the credibility of a particular entity. The reviews dimension like the social media dimension focuses on a particular dimension of credibility that contributes to the derivation of the overall credibility. Specifically the reviews dimension presents the impact that the aggregated quantitative credibility data has to the overall credibility of the entity. From this credibility dimension an entity can readily identify how others are rating or ranking the entity across different review sites such as Yelp and CitySearch without having to individually access and query such review sites. Moreover the reviews credibility module presents various actions that can be performed by the entity to improve upon its credibility. The reviews dimension of credibility factors 1 the sentiment of aggregated quantitative rankings and ratings that target or reference a particular entity 2 the presence of the particular entity across review sites based on the quantity of quantitative rankings and ratings i.e. quantitative credibility data aggregated for the particular entity and 3 the engagement or influence of the particular entity across different review sites.

The interface portal presents the reviews dimension through a set of hierarchical layers. presents the topmost hierarchical layer or first layer for the reviews credibility module when the reviews credibility module is selected in accordance with some embodiments. As shown the topmost layer includes a score pane a visualization pane an updates pane and an actions pane that each present credibility data that is specific to the dimension of credibility for how quantitative reviews e.g. rankings and ratings affect the overall credibility of an entity. Each of the panes also includes drill down functionality that can be used to access additional credibility data for detailing the derivation of the credibility data that is presented in the panes .

The score pane presents various subcomponent scores from which a component credibility score for the reviews dimension of an entity s credibility is derived. The component scores include a reviews sentiment score a reviews presence score and a reviews engagement score. As further detailed by the credibility data presented in the hierarchical layer of which is accessed by drilling down from the score pane the reviews sentiment score is derived by normalizing and averaging the ranking or rating expressed in the quantitative credibility data that is aggregated from reviews sites such as Yelp CitySearch etc. In some embodiments the reviews presence score is derived based on one or more of the number of different review sites and directories in which the entity is listed the number of quantitative reviews that are aggregated for the entity from the review sites the number of other entities that have viewed or accessed the quantitative reviews about the entity and the accuracy of information for identifying the entity across the different review sites. In some embodiments the reviews engagement score is derived based on the responsiveness of an entity to rankings or ratings that are posted for the entity. For example the engagement score is derived based on the number of times an entity has responded to Yelp ratings that are posted for that entity.

The visualization pane presents how the aggregated quantitative credibility data for the entity trends over time. The updates pane presents the most recent set of quantitative credibility data that is aggregated for the entity from different review sites. The complete set of aggregated quantitative credibility data can be accessed by drilling down from the updates pane to access the hierarchical layer of credibility data that is presented for example in . The actions pane presents a prioritized list of suggested actions that the entity can perform to improve the reviews dimensions of its credibility. The prioritized list of suggested actions is automatically determined by the credibility system based on the aggregated quantitative credibility data. The list of suggested actions can include addressing poor quantitative reviews updating information or suggesting changes to certain aspects of the entity that are poorly ranked or rated. A comprehensive list of actions that can be performed by the entity to improve the reviews dimensions of its credibility is accessible by drilling down from the actions pane into the detailed actions hierarchical layer that is presented in .

Yet another dimension of credibility that can be isolated and viewed using the interface portal of some embodiments is the network dimension. The network dimension and the credibility data associated with this credibility dimension are accessed by selection of the network module of . The credibility data for the network dimension identifies the partnerships that are established for an entity. This credibility data can be aggregated from entity networking information that is maintained by the credibility system. Additionally or alternatively this credibility data can be aggregated by the credibility system aggregating association requests from various data sources. In some embodiments the association request includes a friend request a follow request a tag a contact request etc.

Networking is a component of credibility because networking can be indicative of the quality of goods and services that will be offered by an entity and the trustworthiness and reputation of the entity. Specifically an entity that sources good or raw materials from partners that are known to have high quality goods and raw materials than from partners that are known to have low quality goods and raw materials is likely to be more credible because those goods and raw materials will often have a direct impact on the quality of goods and services offered by the entity. Similarly an entity that partners with reputable or trusted partners is likely to be more credible than an entity that partners with unreputable or untrustworthy partners because the entity is held to a higher standard by its partners.

In summary the interface portal provides an interactive display for comprehensively and holistically determining entity credibility with the ability to independently analyze each dimension of credibility by hierarchically providing access to the credibility data that is used to derive each dimension wherein the credibility data is sourced from multiple disparate data sources. Several advantages are afforded from this manner of credibility reporting. Firstly by aggregating credibility data from multiple disparate data sources the derived credibility more accurately reflects the true credibility of an entity while reducing the impact that biased or outdated credibility data from a single data source may have on the derived credibility. Secondly an entity can from a single interface view credibility data from the disparate data sources without having to separately access each such data source. Thirdly the automatically identified actions determined by the credibility system and that are presented in the actions pane and drill down layers accessible from the actions pane provide the entity with discrete readily identifiable actions that the entity can perform in order to improve its credibility without the entity having to understand the nuances of the disparate data sources and without having to manually analyze the aggregated credibility data.

Entity credibility can be presented differently in different embodiments and different dimensions may be used to present such credibility. In the following examples the interface portal provides interactive application cubes instead of the above described credibility modules to present various dimensions of credibility. Moreover the dimensions of credibility provided below include a scoring dimension a multimedia dimension a company information dimension a social networking dimension a mapping dimension a network dimension a financial dimension a reviews dimension and a news dimension that collectively convey a comprehensive and holistic account of entity credibility. Accordingly a different application cube may be provided to contain the credibility data for each such dimension of credibility.

An application cube is in the closed state when it is not being interacted with. In other words a graphical pointing tool is not placed over the application cube a graphical pointing tool was not recently used to click on the application cube key focus is not on the application cube or a touch on a touch sensitive device has not been detected in conjunction with the application cube. In some embodiments the tab or other keyboard key can be used to change key focus to different application cubes and other keyboard keys can be used to interact with the application cube that has key focus. For example pressing the enter keyboard key when an application cube has key focus is similar to clicking on that application cube when a graphical pointing tool is positioned over that application cube. All application cubes are in the closed state except an application cube that is in the active state and or an application cube that is in the open state. Application cubes in the closed state are presented with a fixed size and may contain either static or dynamic content that identifies the credibility data that is associated with the application cube. In some embodiments the graphical element of an application cube in the closed state is used to convey summary credibility data or a particular piece of credibility data. For example an application cube that is associated with credibility scoring may display in its graphical element the overall credibility score for a particular entity as a static value or graphic when that application cube is in the closed state. Other examples are presented in the description below.

An application cube is in the active state when a graphical pointing tool hovers over the application cube when a touch is currently making contact i.e. pressing down on with an application cube on a touch based interface e.g. capacitive or resistive touchscreen or when key focus is on an application cube. An application cube is expanded in size to indicate that it is in the active state and to differentiate it from the closed state application cubes.

An application cube is in the open state when that application cube is clicked on or otherwise selected. When using a touch based interface the application cube may be transitioned to the open state by tapping i.e. touching and releasing the touch the graphical element for that application cube. When using a keyboard the application cube may be transitioned to the open state by giving that application cube key focus and then pressing the enter key or by pressing some keyboard shortcut that directly opens that application cube e.g. pressing ctrl S to open a credibility scoring application cube .

When an application cube is transitioned to the open state that application cube is moved to the top left of the layout as shown by application cube of and a first hierarchical layer of credibility data associated with that application cube is displayed in the application cube content display . Other application cubes in the closed state are moved to accommodate the position of the opened application cube. In some embodiments the website layout of includes various home spots . The home spots are located along the left side column underneath the currently open application cube . The home spot application cubes remain at their designated positions unless transitioned to the open state or removed from the home spots. In some embodiments the application cubes can be dragged and dropped to customize the application cubes at the home spots and the position of other application cubes in the layout. This allows an entity to customize the display by placing the most relevant application cubes in the most easily accessible positions on the website.

Any entity can navigate to different hierarchical layers of credibility data that are associated with the open application cube by interacting with the credibility data and various graphical tools at the current hierarchical layer that is presented in the content display . In some embodiments each lower hierarchical layer presents more detailed credibility data for the data that was presented in the preceding hierarchical layer. The credibility data is presented in this drill down fashion so as to avoid the viewer from being over whelmed with too much data at any particular hierarchical layer.

When a new hierarchical layer is accessed credibility data associated with the new hierarchical layer slides into the content display and the previous content is removed. Invoking a back button causes the content display to return to the previous hierarchical layer or previous credibility data.

As noted above application cubes in the closed state may provide a graphical representation to identify the contained credibility data. In some embodiments the credibility scoring application cube displays an overall credibility score for an entity when in the closed state and displays two or more component scores when in the active state. Application cubes in the closed state need not provide such informative credibility data and can include simple text or graphics to identify the underlying credibility data.

In the content display displays a first hierarchical layer of credibility data that is associated with the credibility scoring application cube that is in the open state. Specifically this first hierarchical layer provides an easily referenced and summarized presentation of the entity s credibility score. As shown the content display presents a dial indicator to graphically represent the overall credibility score for the entity a scale of the credibility score over the past 6 months and slider tools and to allow for interactive adjustments to be made to the display.

In some embodiments the dial indicator and the scale are interactive and can be used to access additional hierarchical layers that provide more detailed information as to the derivation of the overall credibility score. For instance by clicking on the dial indicator a new set of credibility data relating to the derivation of the credibility score is slid into the content display . At this second hierarchical layer the overall credibility score is exploded into two or more component scores from which the overall credibility score is derived. In some embodiments each such component score and the credibility data used to derive the component score is stored at lower hierarchical layers within the credibility scoring section of the credibility report. In some embodiments the component scores include a sentiment score a presence score and an engagement score.

To access additional or more detailed credibility data beyond the second hierarchical layer the component scores are interactive such that an entity can click on each component score to drill down another layer into the credibility score derivation hierarchy. For example clicking on the sentiment score changes the display of the content display to show a plurality of the aggregated quantitative and qualitative credibility data used to derive the sentiment score. Entities can then identify how many positive scores were aggregated which data sources the scores were aggregated from who the users that provided the scores are trends in the scores e.g. overall positive in the last two months etc.

Accordingly the topmost or first hierarchical layer encapsulates the aggregated credibility data associated with a particular application cube in a summary format. From this summary format one can quickly ascertain at least one dimension of an entity s credibility. Each descending hierarchical layer then expands on this dimension of credibility by providing additional or more detailed credibility data from which users can gain additional insight or more in depth knowledge as to the factors affecting that dimension of credibility.

In some embodiments the scale is interactive and can be used to access a second hierarchical layer that provides a more detailed history of the entity s credibility score. Moreover slider tools allow for manipulation of the credibility data presented at the first hierarchical layer. For example changing the slider tool changes the range of scale to present a greater or narrower historical view of the entity s credibility scores.

As noted above the credibility system can monetize the presentation of the information by restricting access of unpaid entities to a first set of hierarchical layers while providing paying entities accesses to additional hierarchical layers that descend beyond the first set of hierarchical layers. In some embodiments a registered entity with enhanced access permissions can modify the presentation of the credibility scoring application cube . To do so the entity first registers with the credibility system by clicking on the link and entering the login information. Once registered one or more enhancement links are presented in the content display whereby the entity can rearrange or change the size of graphical elements in the content display or add or remove content from the hierarchical layer that is currently open as some examples. For example the entity may be allowed to insert awards or certifications at the first hierarchical layer of the credibility scoring application cube to supplement its credibility score.

In some embodiments the multimedia application cube is a cube that provides images e.g. photographs or videos of the brick and mortar store for the respective entity. Additionally the multimedia application cube may include alternative logos images of company events or other company imagery. Such imagery is a dimension of credibility because the imagery can positively or negatively affect whether a user or other business decides to engage in commercial transactions with the entity. For example an image of a run down storefront may dissuade potential clientele from visiting that entity whereas an image of a recently remodeled storefront may attract potential clientele to the entity.

In some embodiments the multimedia application cube provides a static image of the business store front when in the closed state. As shown in the multimedia application cube provides an enlarged or higher resolution image of the business store front when in the active state. In some other embodiments the multimedia application cube provides a spanning image or short video clip of the storefront when in the active state. Also as shown in the content display provides access to a gallery of images or videos of the entity when in the open state of the multimedia application cube . Drilling down into the multiple application cube can provide access to other galleries that provide images of key personnel e.g. management or other satellite branches offices or locations of the entity. Access to the images in these galleries may be restricted to paying customers as a means of monetizing the credibility data associated with the multimedia application cube . A registered entity with enhanced access permissions can supplement the credibility data of the multimedia application cube by adding a recorded or live video feed that shows the interior of its business location. Additionally the enhanced access permissions can allow the entity to update the images in real time whereas those with basic access permissions may be unable to perform such real time updates. Such real time updates can be used as a means to market advertise or promote new goods or services.

In some embodiments the company information application cube provides descriptive company information about an entity. Such information is pertinent to the credibility of an entity in that the information identifies whether or not the correct or desired entity has been selected as many entities may share one or more dimensions of descriptive identification information such as a entity name and URL even though the entity may operate as separate entities. Additionally this application cube may serve as the interface to accessing credit data for the entity or as an interface through which the entity can post news employment opportunities general information about the company coupons promotions and other offers at various hierarchical layers.

In the closed state the company information application cube may display an entity logo. In some embodiments the company information application cube provides a larger company logo when in the active state. The content display displays a first hierarchical layer of credibility data that is associated with the company information application cube when that cube is in the open state. This includes presenting a name address telephone URL etc. of the entity. This information may be sourced from the entity itself or other data sources such as Dun Bradstreet. In some embodiments the first hierarchical layer associated with the company information application cube includes links that when interacted with enable access to a credit report for the entity or other news employment opportunities general information coupons promotions etc. Access to such content may be restricted to paying entities. Moreover the ability to add such content may be restricted to registered entities that have paid for enhanced access permissions. Accordingly a registered entity with basic access permissions will be unable to update its company information application cube with promotions or offers whereas a registered entity with enhanced access permissions will be able to do so.

In some embodiments the social network application cube provides an interface through which social network feeds from one or more social network data sources relating to a particular entity are presented. This dimension of credibility provides a real time view of what others are saying about a particular entity and may also serve as a real time view of what the entity is saying about itself including news promotions etc. As noted above this credibility data can be acquired through partnerships with data sources such as www.twitter.com www.facebook.com and other social network sites. Specifically this credibility data may include twitter tweets and facebook status updates that pertain to the particular entity.

In the closed state the social network application cube may display an icon for identifying the contents of the application cube . As shown in the social network application cube provides a limited set of social network messages e.g. three twitter tweets when in the active state. Also as shown in the content display displays a first hierarchical layer of credibility data that is associated with the social network application cube when that cube is in the open state. In some embodiments this includes displaying social network messages originated by the entity and messages originated by third party submitters. Additional hierarchical layers allow an entity to add or remove various social network feeds and also filter individual messages that inaccurately reflect on the entity. Interactive tools i.e. slider tool associated with the social network application cube allow entities the ability to sort organize or otherwise change the social network messages presented in the content display . In some embodiments free users i.e. nonpaying entities are allowed to access feeds that include messages from other users and not feeds from the entity whereas paying users are allowed to access feeds from both users and the entity. Paying users may also be provided tools to search or organize the data of the feeds. In some embodiments registered entities with enhanced access permissions are allowed to enter real time messages or status updates whereas registered entities with basic access permissions are unable to do so.

In some embodiments the mapping application cube is a geo services cube that provides mapping directions street views and or panoramic imagery for a business entity. This dimension of credibility compliments that presented by the multimedia application cube by providing additional reference as to the distance one would have to travel to visit the business whether the business is located in a desirable area visual identification of the business etc. Such credibility data may be stored in the credibility report or may be referenced in the credibility report using links that access mapping services provided by third parties such as Google Maps or MapQuest.

In the closed state the mapping application cube of some embodiments displays a cropped map with the position of the business pinned on the map. As shown in the mapping application cube provides a larger map of the local area surrounding the business to better orient the user as to the location of that business when the application cube is in the active state. Also as shown in the content display displays a first hierarchical layer of mapping data that is associated with the mapping application cube when that cube is in the open state. Specifically this mapping data includes a full sized map with all associated functionality. The functionality associated with this application cube allows users the ability to interact with the map by zooming panning dragging obtaining directions and changing views street satellite traffic etc. as some examples of available functionality. Certain mapping functionality may be restricted to paying users.

In some embodiments the partnership application cube provides business to business networking whereby business entities can stay connected to and maintain relationships with their suppliers distributers clients etc. Such information provides yet another dimension of credibility by displaying the business contacts so that a user can determine whether that business is associated with other reputable businesses which can serve as an indication as to the quality of the business goods services and growth potential. For example whether the components of the goods sold by the business are sourced from a reputable supplier or a supplier who is known to have quality issues. In some embodiments this information is stored to the credibility report in different hierarchical layers whereby a first hierarchical layer displays first degree connections i.e. direct business contacts and a second hierarchical layer displays second degree connections i.e. indirect business contacts or business contacts that are separated by at least one intermediary . The credibility report may contain reference links in order to obtain the partnership or networking information from third party data sources such as www.linkedin.com or www.spoke.com.

In the closed state the partnership application cube displays an icon or graphical representation for identifying the number of established entity connections. As shown in the partnership application cube provides a visual representation of the established entity connections when in the active state. In some embodiments this representation graphically displays multiple degrees of connections e.g. first degree and second degree connections . Also as shown in the content display displays a first hierarchical layer of partnership data when the partnership application cube is in the open state. This includes displaying established first degree entity connections whereby clicking on or interacting with a first degree entity connection accesses a second hierarchical layer that displays second degree entity connections that are associated with the clicked on or interacted with first degree entity connection. In some embodiments the content display provides a large visualization of the entity s partnership network whereby all entities in the entity s partnership network are linked to identify the at least first and second degree connections. Such visualization can be supplemented using maps that display a physical location of each established connection.

In some embodiments nonpaying entities are allowed to view the connections and paying entities are permitted to both view the connections and contact partners displayed via the connections. For example by clicking on a partner icon a paying entity can send an email or connection request to that partner. In this manner entities can expand their own network with other entities that are known to be credible by virtue of their association with other credible entities. Entities with enhanced access permissions are allowed to add new connections to or remove existing connections from the partnership network in order to maintain an up to date and real time view of the partnership network.

In some embodiments the financial application cube is for presenting financial data for publicly traded companies or for companies that otherwise disclose their financial records. This dimension of credibility supplements other credibility data of the other application cubes by disclosing the financial state of a given business in the same interactive window as other aggregated credibility data. As such a user or business does not have to access or create accounts with multiple data sources to view all such data. In some embodiments the financial data is aggregated to the credibility reports or is acquired in real time using links in the credibility report that reference other financial data sources such as Yahoo Finance or Etrade.

In the closed state the financial application cube may display a stock symbol for the corresponding business entity. When in the active state the financial application cube provides a chart displaying the stock price or other measure of financial health of the business entity over a specified time period. In some embodiments the content display displays a first hierarchical layer of financial data when the financial application cube is in the open state. This data includes stock charts stock price ticker news relating to the business news relating to the corresponding industry of the business and analyst ratings and reports as some examples. Entities can interact with the data to access different second hierarchical layers of financial data while the financial application cube is in the open state. For example clicking or interacting with a stock chart will change the content display to allow a user to change the chart range e.g. 5 minute 1 day 1 month etc. and clicking or interacting with a news link will change the content display to show the news report. In some embodiments paying entities will have access to exclusive financial information such as analyst reports.

In some embodiments the reviews application cube is for presenting aggregated reviews and ratings related to an entity. This credibility data includes the above described aggregated qualitative data and quantitative from data sources such as www.yelp.com and www.citysearch.com. In the closed state the reviews application cube may display an aggregate or summary quantitative score that is based on available reviews for that entity across different data sources. When in the active state the reviews application cube displays the three most current or recently submitted reviews. When in the open state the reviews application cube populates the content display with a listing of reviews and ratings. Interactions when the reviews application cube is in the open state allow entities the ability to filter the reviews and rating by the data sources the reviews that are associated with a particular rating or location e.g. a particular branch . It should be apparent that other interactions may be available to provide additional means with which to sort or organize the presented credibility data that is associated with the reviews application cube . In some embodiments enhanced interactions associated with this application cube allow entities the ability to report mismatched reviews or remove certain types of reviews e.g. biased incorrect negative etc. . In some embodiments some degree of overlap exists between the reviews application cube and the credibility scoring application cube . However such overlap is mitigated based on the structure of how the overlapping credibility data is presented and in what hierarchical layers different credibility data is presented.

In some embodiments the news application cube provides news that is specific to an entity. The news may be sourced from aggregators such as Topix or one or more RSS feeds from news data sources. In the closed state the news application cube provides a newspaper icon or a recent news headline. When in the active state the news application cube provides a recent news headline or a snippet from the related story. When in the open state the content display is populated with clickable or interactive news headline listings whereby clicking or interactive with a particular listing accesses a second hierarchical layer that presents the complete news story.

The foregoing is presented as an exemplary set of application cubes for grouping and presenting credibility data. Additional application cubes may be included in addition to or instead of some of the application cubes of the above described set of application cubes. For example application cubes that present comps i.e. information about related entities may be included or that present milestones for an entity in a timeline format may be included. Accordingly the exemplary set of application cubes is not meant to be an exhaustive listing and other application cubes may be developed to supplement or alter the functionality of the interface portal of some embodiments.

In some embodiments the interface portal dynamically generates a website for a particular entity that includes those application cubes for which corresponding credibility data exists in the credibility report for that particular entity. For example a first entity may be a publicly traded company for which financial information is publicly available and a second entity may be a privately held company for which financial information is not publicly available. In this example the interface portal will dynamically generate a website for the first entity that includes the financial application cube and will dynamically generate a website for the second entity that will not include the financial application cube . As another example social network data such as tweets may exist for the second entity and not for the first entity. Accordingly the interface portal will dynamically generate a website for the first entity that does not include the social network application cube and will dynamically generate a website for the second entity that does include the social network application cube .

Many of the above described processes and modules are implemented as software processes that are specified as a set of instructions recorded on a non transitory computer readable storage medium also referred to as computer readable medium . When these instructions are executed by one or more computational element s such as processors or other computational elements like ASICs and FPGAs they cause the computational element s to perform the actions indicated in the instructions. Computer and computer system are meant in their broadest sense and can include any electronic device with a processor including cellular telephones smartphones portable digital assistants tablet devices laptops desktops and servers. Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to CD ROMs flash drives RAM chips hard drives EPROMs etc.

The bus collectively represents all system peripheral and chipset buses that communicatively connect the numerous internal devices of the computer system . For instance the bus communicatively connects the processor with the read only memory the system memory and the permanent storage device . From these various memory units the processor retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the invention. The processor is a processing device such as a central processing unit integrated circuit graphical processing unit etc.

The read only memory ROM stores static data and instructions that are needed by the processor and other modules of the computer system. The permanent storage device on the other hand is a read and write memory device. This device is a non volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the computer system is off. Some embodiments of the invention use a mass storage device such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive as the permanent storage device .

Other embodiments use a removable storage device such as a flash drive as the permanent storage device. Like the permanent storage device the system memory is a read and write memory device. However unlike storage device the system memory is a volatile read and write memory such a random access memory RAM . The system memory stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime. In some embodiments the processes are stored in the system memory the permanent storage device and or the read only memory .

The bus also connects to the input and output devices and . The input devices enable the user to communicate information and select commands to the computer system. The input devices include any of a capacitive touchscreen resistive touchscreen any other touchscreen technology a trackpad that is part of the computing system or attached as a peripheral a set of touch sensitive buttons or touch sensitive keys that are used to provide inputs to the computing system or any other touch sensing hardware that detects multiple touches and that is coupled to the computing system or is attached as a peripheral. The input device also include alphanumeric keypads including physical keyboards and touchscreen keyboards pointing devices also called cursor control devices . The input devices also include audio input devices e.g. microphones MIDI musical instruments etc. . The output devices display images generated by the computer system. The output devices include printers and display devices such as liquid crystal displays LCD .

Finally as shown in bus also couples computer to a network through a network adapter not shown . In this manner the computer can be a part of a network of computers such as a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or an Intranet or a network of networks such as the Internet. For example the computer may be coupled to a web server network so that a web browser executing on the computer can interact with the web server as a user interacts with a GUI that operates in the web browser.

As mentioned above the computer system may include one or more of a variety of different computer readable media. Some examples of such computer readable media include RAM ROM read only compact discs CD ROM recordable compact discs CD R rewritable compact discs CD RW read only digital versatile discs e.g. DVD ROM dual layer DVD ROM a variety of recordable rewritable DVDs e.g. DVD RAM DVD RW DVD RW etc. flash memory e.g. SD cards mini SD cards micro SD cards etc. magnetic and or solid state hard drives ZIP disks read only and recordable blu ray discs any other optical or magnetic media and floppy disks.

While the invention has been described with reference to numerous specific details one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the invention. Thus one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the invention is not to be limited by the foregoing illustrative details but rather is to be defined by the appended claims.
