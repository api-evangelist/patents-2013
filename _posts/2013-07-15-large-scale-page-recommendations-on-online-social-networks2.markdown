A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Matrix factorization is a factorization of a matrix into a product of matrices. Low rank matrix factorizations are effective tools for analysis of dyadic data which aims at discovering and capturing the interactions between two entities. Successful applications include topic detection and keyword search where the corresponding entities are documents and terms news personalization users and stories and recommendation systems users and items . In large applications these problems can involve matrices with millions of rows e.g. distinct customers millions of columns e.g. distinct items and billions of entries e.g. interactions between customers and items .

In particular embodiments the social networking system may identify content objects to recommend or advertise to large numbers of users of an online social network. Such recommendations may be identified in order to optimize the conversion rate of content presented to users. Content recommendations may be determined by optimizing an objective function comprising predicted rating functions wherein each rating function for a user concept pair comprises a dot product of a user score vector and a concept score vector and bias values. However computing the dot product of these vectors for all users of the online social network directly may be prohibitive from a time and processing perspective. In particular embodiments the social networking system may predict interests of a user through collaborative filtering based on connections to entities provided by the user and leverage these interests to make content recommendations. The online social network may be associated with more than a billion users and many millions of concepts e.g. places websites entities resources etc. where it may be desirable to recommend these users and concepts to other users. Instead of using rating data from all users and all concepts which may be an unfeasibly large data set the social networking system may use rating data from only a sample of users with respect to all concepts associated with the online social network and use this limited data set to calculate the concept traits. These concept traits may then be fixed and used to calculate user traits for all remaining users of the online social network. After getting user traits and concept traits instead of calculating the scores directly for each user concept pair the social networking system may use random projection to scope down the concepts for every user. It may determine the most similar concepts for every concept based on cosine similarity distance of the concept trait vectors and then use that as source to provide suggestions to users e.g. concepts most similar to one the user has previously liked or otherwise interacted with .

As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify content objects to recommend or advertise to large numbers of users of an online social network. These content objects may be user profile pages concept profile pages multimedia content advertisements or any other suitable objects associated with the online social network. Such recommendations may be identified in order to optimize conversion rate i.e. number of interactions clicks vs. number of impressions of content presented to users. Content recommendations may be computed by optimizing an objective function comprising predicted rating functions wherein each rating function for a user concept pair u i comprises a dot product of a user score vector P u and a concept score vector Q i and bias values. However directly computing of the dot product of these vectors for all users of the online social network may be prohibitive from a time and processing perspective. Thus it may be advantageous to provide a more efficient way to determine targeted and relevant concept recommendations to users based on each user s personal taste. In particular embodiments social networking system may predict interests of a user through collaborative filtering based on connections to entities provided by the user e.g. user generated edge connections between user nodes and other nodes of social graph which may be referred to as rating data and leverage these interests to make content recommendations. The challenge is that at the online social network may be associated with more than a billion users and many millions of concepts corresponding to user nodes and concept nodes respectively where it may be desirable to recommend these users and concepts e.g. recommend their corresponding profile pages to other users. Due to the size of the social graph it may be prohibitive to use standard dimension reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition SVD to calculate user recommendations due to time and computational power constraints. Even if the system can get a low dimensional approximation of users and recommendations the cost of calculating the score of all possible user concept pairs may be extremely high. As an example and not by way of limitation for a social graph comprising over 1 billion user nodes and 5 millions concept nodes it would take over 5 quadrillion 5 10 computations to analyze all user concept pairs which may be infeasible to complete within a reasonable timeframe. Even if all concepts can be scored on an individual basis serving recommendations from such a large set requires large scale infrastructure. Therefore instead of using rating data from all users and all concepts which may be an unfeasibly large data set social networking may use rating data from only a sample of users e.g. 1 with respect to all concepts associated with the online social network and use this limited data set to calculate all concept traits. These concept traits may then be fixed and used to calculate user traits for all remaining users of the online social network. After getting user traits and concept traits instead of calculating the scores directly for each user concept pair social networking system may use random projection to scope down the concepts for every user. It may determine the most similar concepts for every concept based on cosine similarity distance of the concept trait vectors and then use that as source to provide suggestions to users e.g. concepts most similar to one the user has previously liked or otherwise interacted with . Although this disclosure describes identifying particular content objects to recommend or advertise in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable content objects to recommend or advertise in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may access user concept scores for a first set of user nodes of the plurality of nodes respectively. Each user concept score may be with respect to particular user concept pairs comprising a user node from the first set of user nodes that is connected by an edge to a concept node from the plurality of concept nodes. The first set of user nodes may comprise a representative number of user nodes corresponding to a representative sample of users of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation the first set of user nodes may comprise approximately 1 of the user nodes of the plurality of user nodes of social graph although any other suitable fraction may be used such as for example 0.1 1 2 5 10 or another suitable fraction of the users of the online social network . In connection with identifying and selecting user sets particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 939 093 filed 10 Jul. 2013 which is incorporated by reference. In particular embodiments social networking system may access a ratings matrix R representing the user concept scores for the first set of user nodes . Rating matrix R may comprise ratings of users to concepts where R u i may present the rating from the user node u to the concept node i. Ratings matrix R may be generated by self reported connections between users and entities e.g. edge connections when a user likes a concept . In the context of social graph nodes connected by an edge may be considered to have a rating score with respect to the node pair while unconnected nodes may have no score or a null score with respect to the node pair. The ratings matrix R may be extremely spare in that the typical user may have rated liked very few concepts relative to the total number of concepts associated with the online social network. In other words the typical user node may be connected by edges to relatively few concept nodes . But a ratings matrix R for all users may have a very large dimensionality if there are for example over a billion users and millions of concepts. Based on the ratings matrix R social networking system may then determine a user matrix P wherein the user matrix P comprises a plurality of user score vectors P u for each user node u of the first set of users nodes . Social networking system may also determine a concept matrix Q based on the ratings matrix R wherein the concept matrix Q comprises a plurality of concept score vectors Q i for each concept node i of the plurality of concepts nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may take 1 of users and all concepts collect interaction history e.g. edge type information regarding connections user nodes to concept nodes between the 1 users and concepts as training data and use a distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm to calculate user trace vectors for all 1 users and concept trace vectors for all concepts and biases for all user concept pairs. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular user concept scores in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates accessing any suitable user concept scores in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate a recommendation algorithm for estimating recommended user concept scores for all user concept pairs in the first set of user nodes and the plurality of concept nodes . The recommended user concept scores may be based on the accessed user concept scores as described previously. In particular embodiments social networking system may use a matrix factorization model to allow for the computation of a recommendation score for every user concept pair u i by use of user traits and concept traits. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may calculate a recommendation score from a ratings matrix R. Social networking system may access a user matrix P based on ratings matrix R where user matrix P comprises a plurality of user score vectors P u also called user trait vectors for each user node u of the first set of user nodes wherein each user node u is associated with a user bias vector B u . In other words in user matrix P each row may be indexed by a user and the columns may be values in a trait space. The trait space of user matrix P may have dimension k. Social networking system may then access a concept matrix Q based on ratings matrix R where the concept matrix Q comprises a plurality of concept score vectors Q i also called concept trait vectors for each concept node i of the plurality of concepts wherein each concept node i is associated with a concept bias vector B i . In other words concept matrix Q is a matrix where each column is indexed by a concept and the rows are values in a trait space. The trait space of concept matrix Q may have dimension k as well. The columns of concept matrix Q are referenced by concept node i. Every user may have a bias value defined by user bias vector B u where Bis a vector of all biases of users. Similarly every concept may have a bias value defined by concept bias vector B i where Bis a vector of all biases of concepts. Social networking system may then generate an estimator matrix R representing recommended user concept scores for the first set of user nodes wherein the rating of user node u to concept node i is R u i P u Q i B u B i for each user concept pair u i . In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the user matrix P the user score vectors P u for each user node u the concept matrix Q and the concept score vectors Q i for each concept node i using distributed stochastic gradient descent DSGD . As an example and not by way of limitation the implementation algorithm used by social networking system may use distributed stochastic gradient descent to find user matrix P concept matrix Q user bias vector B u and concept bias vector B i such that the score rating of user node u and concept node i generated by the formula for R u i most closely matches R u i . The algorithm may be run on a sample of data in a pre training phase and from those results it may then be extrapolated to all data. Final scores ratings may be calculated using random projection and the top scoring concepts may then be stored for use by the recommendation processes of social networking system . User matrix P and concept matrix Q do not need to be trained by DSGD for all users and all concepts. Instead for a sample of users and all concepts a full run of DSGD may be run to learn user matrix P and concept matrix Q from this sample. In this way concept matrix Q and concept bias vector B i may be learned from a smaller sample. These values for the concept traits and concept offsets may then be fixed. To calculate user matrix P for all users repeated samples may then be chosen from the set of users without replacement. Each sample may then be used to compute a sub matrix of user matrix P corresponding to the users in the sample. This sub matrix may be calculated by applying DSGD to the optimization process described with respect to matrix factorization above holding concept matrix Q and concept bias vector B i fixed from pre training. In the first training step social networking system may optimize to discover user score vectors P u for each user node u and concept score vectors Q i for each concept node i on a random sample of users P and all items Q. The concept traits can then be fixed and social networking system may then run numerous processes on the partitions of the user base to calculate P u for that user base. These processes may be run in parallel and each parallel run may be done by running DSGD on a cluster of machines. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may fix the concept trace vectors and all biases and use the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm to train with data for the remaining 99 of users of the online social network assuming the first set comprised approximately 1 of users and calculate user trace vectors for all users concept trace vectors for all concepts and biases for all user concept pairs. Although this disclosure describes generating particular recommendation algorithms in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable recommendation algorithm in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate recommended user concept scores for a second set of user nodes of the plurality of nodes. The first set of user nodes may be discrete from the second set of user nodes . The recommended user concept score may be for example an affinity coefficient as discussed below or a factor used when determining social graph affinity. In particular embodiments the second set of user nodes may comprise substantially all remaining user nodes of social graph . Social networking system may take the concept traits determined by a run of optimization on the first set of users nodes as described previously and use these to compute user traits for all other partitions of users of the online social network. The second set of user nodes may be divided into a plurality of discrete sets of users. As an example and not by way of limitation the second set of user nodes may comprise approximately 100 of the user nodes of social graph not included in the first set of user nodes . For every user and every concept social networking system may have a vector that represents the user s interest and a vector that represents the concept s traits. As described above along with the offsets social networking system may quantitatively compute how much a concept matches a user s interest by taking an inner product of the two vectors. For concept recommendations social networking system may compute that score for all concepts for a user rank all concepts based on that score and pick the top n results. However as discussed previously with over one billion users and many million of concepts there may be trillion computations required to estimate scores for all concepts with respect to all users which may be infeasible to complete within a reasonable time frame. This problem may be solved using random projection hashing . As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may use random projection hashing to project the user trace vectors and concept trace vectors to a plurality of sub spaces or buckets such that in each sub space the user and concept trace vectors have high cosine similarity similar bit map or roughly pointing in the same direction . Since the user and concept trace vectors may have high cosine similarity in a bucket the dot product of user and concepts trace vectors and thus computation of the rating functions may be carried out. The random projection may result in only a small loss e.g. 2 of conversion rate. In particular embodiments when calculating recommended user concept scores for the second set of user nodes of the plurality of nodes social networking system may use a random projection process. Social networking system may calculate for each user node of the second set of user nodes a plurality of user bias vectors B u wherein each user bias vector B u is associated with a user node u of the second set of user nodes. Social networking system may then map the plurality of user bias vectors B u and a plurality of concept bias vectors B i to a plurality of sub spaces using random hash functions wherein each concept bias vector B i is associated with a concept node i of the plurality of concept nodes. Social networking system may then calculate for each sub space user concept scores for the user node u of the second set of user nodes associated with the user bias vector B u mapped to the sub space wherein the user concept scores are equal to B u B i for the user bias vector B u and the concept bias vector B i mapped to the sub space. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may define a series of random hash functions and use them to map each user interest vector and each concept interest vector to a sub space with a sub space ID. This process is similar to locality sensitive hashing LSH and provides a low dimensional approximation of the concept and user traits. Social networking system may then compute for each sub space the inner products for all user and all concepts vectors within the same sub space. After this process for any particular user and any particular concept social networking system may be able to calculate a recommended user concept score. For every user social networking system may rank all the concepts whose vectors are in the same sub spate as the user s vector based on the score. The top n concepts for that user may then be stores as recommendations for the user. In particular embodiments this process may be repeated at specified time intervals so that new or updated recommendations may be generated for each user. Although this disclosure describes calculating particular recommended user concept scores in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating any suitable recommended user concept scores in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may send recommendations for one or more concept nodes to one or more users corresponding to the user nodes of the second set of user nodes based on the calculated recommended user concept scores for the second set of user nodes . Based on the calculated ratings functions social networking system may then rank the concepts with respect to each user based on the scores and store the ranking e.g. a list of 50 top ranked concept profile pages for the each user. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may recommend one or more pages e.g. user profile pages or concept profile pages to users of the online social network. After calculating recommended user concept scores social networking system may for example send a recommendation or advertisement to a user such as Pages you may like People you should follow or Groups you should join where the recommendation or advertisement comprises a reference a node based on the recommended user concept score with respect to user receiving the recommendation or advertisement and the concept being referenced. As another example and not by way of limitation the calculated recommended user concept scores may be used to calculate social graph affinity or affinity coefficients as described below which may be used as a factor when providing recommendations advertisements search results or other suitable content for a user of an online social network. Although this disclosure describes sending particular recommendations in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates sending any suitable recommendations in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part a the history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of a observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content tagging or being tagged in images joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.
