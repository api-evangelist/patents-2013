The subject matter described herein relates generally to data processing networks and more particularly to systems and methods for automatically logging into a user account.

Many people are users of more than one email account and or more than one account of another type e.g. social network online shopping etc. . In a single day a typical user may access the user s personal email account a few times to handle personal communication and access the user s work email account a few times to handle communication for work. The accesses to the accounts may switch back and forth.

To further complicate the situation a user may access different accounts using one device e.g. a mobile device tablet laptop desktop etc. or from any one of two or more devices. Often it is confusing to maintain knowledge of which device is used to log on to which account and if an account is left open e.g. logged on on a device that should not have been e.g. exposing to security and or privacy risks .

The subject matter includes a device implemented method for automatically logging into a user account including a device implemented method for logging into a user account comprising receiving using a device data from an external source or from two or more sources comprising an internal source and another source wherein the external source is not a user determining using the device that at least a portion of received data is new data and based on the received data automatically logging in from the device to an account of the user.

The subject matter also includes a non transitory computer readable medium having stored therein computer executable instructions for receiving using a device data from an external source or from two or more sources comprising an internal source and another source wherein the external source is not a user determining using the device that at least a portion of received data is new data and based on the received data automatically logging in from the device to an account of the user.

The subject matter further includes at least one computing device comprising storage and a processor configured to perform receiving using a device data from an external source or from two or more sources comprising an internal source and another source wherein the external source is not a user determining using the device that at least a portion of received data is new data and based on the received data automatically logging in from the device to an account of the user.

In addition to a device implemented method as described above the subject matter may be implemented in a system by one or more servers and or as codes stored on a computer readable medium but are not limited thereto.

The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example implementations. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. The examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing systems and methods for automatically logging into a user account or service.

User may access one or more personal email accounts one or more work email accounts one or more personal social network accounts one or more social network accounts associated with work profession other organizations e.g. not for profit organizations or special interest groups etc. and other and online services. At different times on different dates and or at different locations user may access different online services switching among many accounts in some days. Some or all of the switching of accounts may be automatically initiated or performed for the user without being initiated by the user.

For example building may be the user s home with a network access point that provides access to some networks for devices e.g. a laptop and e.g. a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet computing device . When user is at home she for simplicity user is referred to as Alice mainly accesses her personal accounts and services such as a personal email a person social network account and a personal shopping account. Occasionally Alice may access non personal accounts e.g. checking her work email to keep track of a project etc. . She may use device and or at home.

User may travel or commute to her work. On the way to work or from work she may access her personal accounts and non personal accounts using device . At work in building she mainly accesses accounts associated with her work e.g. work email account using a work computer and or device . Occasionally she may access her personal accounts at work e.g. using her personal email to communicate with her babysitter etc. using device and or . Logging into an account or connecting to an online service may be automatically initiated or performed auto connect for Alice when a context associated with that account or online service is detected or identified.

Alice has full control of the auto connect features. Alice may opt in to activate one or more features. Alice may define configure or customize the features. For example Alice may define numerous contexts in which a device may automatically initiate e.g. propose or suggest a connection to an online service on Alice s behalf. Alice may fine tune the features by for example using settings to customize the features and or by providing feedback to teach the device regarding the context and or the accuracy of a detected context.

Alice may opt out of any auto connect features. In some implementations the auto connect features may be activated turn on or deactivated turn off using a user s voice. For example when a device is in a state to accept voice command Alice may say cancel auto connect e.g. before Alice enters a movie theater . Alice may turn on or enable the auto connect features by saying to the device for example activate auto connect e.g. as she steps out of the theater .

An example of one or more devices and may be computing device described below in . Devices and may include but are not limited to a computer e.g. a laptop computing device a mobile device e.g. smartphone or tablet a television a server computer computing devices storage devices and .

In some implementations devices and may be considered user devices e.g. devices that may be used by user and or other users to login to accounts and or access online services . Devices may be devices associated with service providers e.g. used to provide services such as email and or other online services and or store data .

For example Alice may access her personal email before a prescribed time e.g. 8 00 AM using device and or . On her way to work Alice may access view and or share content from one of her social network account and access work email using device . Arriving to her work place by 8 30 AM Alice uses her work computer to access her work email and use device to access her personal email. In the evenings on weekdays Alice may watch television shows using device e.g. a television with computing capabilities or hardware . In a weekday evening if is on the first to 15of a month she also logs into her work email using television to monitor her email traffic e.g. she may be responsible for email support the first half of each month .

Devices and may include mechanisms to learn Alice s online services access patterns and automatically logon when Alice has opted in to the appropriate online services based on the patterns. In some example implementations mechanisms may be provided for Alice to configure set or teach her access patterns. Alice s access patterns may be based on one or more sources of data.

Table 1 shows examples of sources that provide context data. Some sources may be referred to as external sources and some may be referred to as internal sources. A source or group of related sources of data originated external to a device is referred to as an external source. Examples of external sources include location proximity contact theme audio camera calendar of another user and any other external source. Data provided or transmitted from an external source are detected or received by a device.

A source or group of related sources of data originated by a device or internal of a device is referred to as an internal source. An internal source can be hardware software or a combination of both such as a module or an application executed on the device and or a component a clock a storage sensors input interfaces switches etc. embedded in or attached to the device. Examples of internal sources include calendar of the user of the device time actions gestures and any other internal source.

Table 1 left column shows the identifiers or labels of sources of data an identifier may refer to two or more related source of data . The next two columns provide indications of the sources being external or internal. The Examples column provides examples of the sources of data. Some sources of data are further described herein below and in the examples of use .

The location source of data refers to one or more sources of data that provide or can be used on infer location information e.g. GPS data or signals wireless data such as Wi Fi Bluetooth NFC infrared signals etc. . Examples of sources of location data include satellites network access points or other devices.

The proximity source of data refers to one or more sources of data may that provide or can be used on infer proximity information. For example Alice s friends and or co workers may allow her to receive their location information. Devices used by her friends and or co workers may provide their location information directly to Alice s device e.g. device or to be accessed by Alice through a service provider e.g. providing location information sharing . When Alice accesses that service from any device their location information is available for access from that device.

Another example of proximity data is the information about a device or location. For example when Alice returns home where there is a WiFi access point or a printer etc. . Information about that access point or printer such as the access point s identifier e.g. the service set identification or SSID media access control address or MAC address etc. provides an indication that a device e.g. device that is in range to receive the identity information of the access point is in the proximity or near the access point. The stronger the signal of the access point implies the closer to the access point.

Auto connect features may be implemented as software modules or applications collectively referred to as an auto connect app executed on a device to provide the features on that device. An auto connect app on one device may communicate with another auto connect app on another device for example to shared information or detected contexts.

In one auto connect example Alice may work from home and log into her work email account using device . An auto connect app executing on device may monitor a few data sources for context changes. Audio may be a source configured to be monitor. Alice may have configured the auto connect app e.g. through settings to teach the auto connect app that detecting the voices of her children constitute a context change. When the auto connect app detects using the microphone of device voices of Alice s children e.g. who have returned home from school the auto connect app based on Alice s configuration automatically logs into Alice s home email account. In some situations the auto connect application provides a user interface with a few options for Alice to choose or otherwise provide input.

Option allows Alice to confirm agree or accept a proposal or suggestion of an online service e.g. login to Alice s personal account due the detecting a new context being Alice s home . In some implementations option may ask for Alice s login credentials. If the detected context and or the proposed option is incorrect or not what Alice wants Alice may choose option to provide feedback that indicates the proposed context or connection is incorrect or to be changed e.g. do not provide the same proposal under the same context from now on . Based on Alice s feedback the auto connect app may look for another account or service to propose or provide a serious of questions to Alice to learn what to propose if the same context change is detected in the future or to learn that the context change needs additional or different data.

Another option allows Alice to edit different settings and or the detected context to for example fine tuning the auto connect features. For example Alice may be satisfied that every time so far the auto connect app has correctly detected the arrived home context and correctly proposed logging into Alice s personal account e.g. personal email account . Instead of selecting option to accept the proposal this time Alice wants to indicate that from now on go ahead and make the connection automatically without being asked or prompted. Alice decides to use the edit option to for example set a flag that tells the auto connect app to automatically login to my personal account when arrived home is detected.

After the flag is set the auto connect app will without presenting UI automatically login to Alice s personal account when detecting that she has arrived home. Alice may clear the flag or change any settings at any time by for example activating a console or setting screen not shown of the auto connect app. Alice may also turn on or off the auto connect app by for example voice commands as describe above and or other UI not shown .

Returning to where other examples of context changes are represented. For example device may also detect an arrived home context based on for example proximity data e.g. detecting device is nearby . Instead of proposing to login to Alice s person email account as shown on device device may proposed to connect to Alice s shopping account based on historic data or Alice s settings on device which indicate to the like of an auto connect app that Alice logs into her shopping account when she is home. Depending on Alice s setting the like of UI may or may not be provided on device to ask Alice to accept the proposal.

Alice may define other contexts such as whenever a camera on her mobile device detects one of the paintings on the walls of home or made two such detections within a time window then propose or initiate to switch to Alice s home email account. Alice may define a context that looks for the current time being after 7 00 PM Monday to Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday detects that Alice is not at work e.g. based on location and or proximity data then log off her work email account if logged on and automatically without confirmation logs into another email account. Alice provides the credentials needed to login to that account. Another context Alice may define is based on time e.g. 7 00 PM Monday to Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday and one or more actions e.g. Alice exits or closes a program or application associated with work such as an account payable application .

As user Alice enters meeting room Alice s music streaming or playing on device may automatically mute or turned off based on detecting that Alice is in meeting room and or based on proximity data showing four users are in the room. As soon as Alice walks in building office e.g. based on location and or proximity data shared from device Alice s work computer may automatically log into resources needed for the day based on calendar entries.

The contexts described herein are mere examples and not limited to those described. A context may be based on one or more source of data. Table 1 above shows a few data source examples. Once a context is detected a device e.g. executing an associated plugin module application program etc. may propose or suggest an action for a user e.g. login to or logoff from an account connect to or disconnect from a service start or stop a program service etc. . The proposed or suggested action may be taken automatically for the user e.g. if the user so indicated in a setting . If taking the proposed or suggested action necessitates additional actions the additional actions are also performed. For example if logging in an account from one device requires logging of the account from another device a proposed login to that account if accepted by the user may lead to sending an account logoff request e.g. to a service provider of that account or to another device that has logged into that account .

Additionally for example but not by way of limitation a filtering approach may be employed in which associated account content is blended. Based on the above described context switch e.g. potential input signals shown in Table 1 above the example implementation automatically opens a related account and or content e.g. online content stored in email a cloud computing environment a social networking environment or the like . For example but not by way of limitation when arriving in a meeting room a browser may open the right account identities and focus on relevant content for the meeting. The filtering may be applied not just in a single account but with multiple open accounts that are associated. For example when searching for birthday results may show both work and private related email content.

If the received data and the updated data represent a new context e.g. a change of context at block automatically connect to a service e.g. login to an account such as email account for a user.

In some implementations before block one or more options may be presented to the user at block . For example the options may include accepting or agreeing with a proposed action indicating that a proposed action and or the underlying context are wrong and edit auto connect settings. Different or other options may be provided depending on implementations. When the user indicates that he or she is accepting or agreeing with a proposed action which may be logging into an account process may flow to an optional block another account may be logged of or the same account may be logged off from another device.

If the user chooses the option for indicating that a proposed action and or the underlying context are wrong process learn from the wrong action and or context at block . Learning from a wrong proposal in some implementations simply means do not provide the same proposal based on the same context. In other implementations learning may involve fine tuning a proposal. For example one or more questions may be asked of the user to learn of a deviation of the context e.g. at 7 30 PM instead of 7 00 PM or a change to the proposed action e.g. to login to another one of the user s personal email account instead of the one in the proposed action .

If the user chooses to edit the auto connect settings process provides mechanism or UI for doing so at .

In some examples process may be implemented with different fewer or more blocks. Process may be implemented as computer executable instructions which can be stored on a medium loaded onto one or more processors of one or more computing devices and executed as a computer implemented method.

Computing device can be communicatively coupled to input user interface and output device interface . Either one or both of input user interface and output device interface can be a wired or wireless interface and can be detachable. Input user interface may include any device component sensor or interface physical or virtual that can be used to provide input e.g. buttons touch screen interface keyboard a pointing cursor control microphone camera braille motion sensor optical reader and or the like . Output device interface may include a display television monitor printer speaker braille or the like. In some example implementations input user interface and output device interface can be embedded with or physically coupled to the computing device . In other example implementations other computing devices may function as or provide the functions of input user interface and output device interface for a computing device .

Examples of computing device may include but are not limited to highly mobile devices e.g. smartphones devices in vehicles and other machines devices carried by humans and animals and the like mobile devices e.g. tablets notebooks laptops personal computers portable televisions radios and the like and devices not designed for mobility e.g. desktop computers other computers information kiosks televisions with one or more processors embedded therein and or coupled thereto radios and the like .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled e.g. via I O interface to external storage and network for communicating with any number of networked components devices and systems including one or more computing devices of the same or different configuration. Computing device or any connected computing device can be functioning as providing services of or referred to as a server client thin server general machine special purpose machine or another label.

 O interface can include but is not limited to wired and or wireless e.g. radio infrared etc. interfaces using any communication or I O protocols or standards e.g. Ethernet 802.11x Universal System Bus WiMax modem a cellular network protocol near field communication NFC Bluetooth and the like for communicating information to and or from at least all the connected components devices and network in computing environment . Network can be any network or combination of networks e.g. the Internet local area network wide area network a telephonic network a cellular network satellite network and the like .

Computing device can use and or communicate using computer usable or computer readable media including transitory media and non transitory media. Transitory media include transmission media e.g. metal cables fiber optics signals carrier waves and the like. Non transitory media include magnetic media e.g. disks and tapes optical media e.g. CD ROM digital video disks Blu ray disks solid state media e.g. RAM ROM flash memory solid state storage and other non volatile storage or memory.

Computing device can be used to implement techniques methods applications processes or computer executable instructions in some example computing environments. Computer executable instructions can be retrieved from transitory media and stored on and retrieved from non transitory media. The executable instructions can originate from one or more of any programming scripting and machine languages e.g. C C C Java Visual Basic Python Perl JavaScript and others .

Processor s can execute under any operating system OS not shown in a native or virtual environment. One or more applications can be deployed that include logic unit application programming interface API unit input unit output unit data sources manager context processing device manager and inter unit communication mechanism for the different units to communicate with each other with the OS and with other applications not shown . For example data sources manager context processing and device manager may implement one or more processes shown or described in . The described units and elements can be varied in design function configuration or implementation and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

In some example implementations when information or an execution instruction is received by API unit it may be communicated to one or more other units e.g. logic unit input unit output unit data sources manager context processing and device manager . For example when input unit receives data from one or more sources the data are passed to data sources manager which filters the data based on user settings or configuration of the auto connect features. Context processing unit processes the data to determine if the data show a context or a change of context. If it is determined that a context exists for an auto login or connect action device manager performs the auto action. The auto action may be preceded by seeking the user s acceptance e.g. providing a UI with options as shown in . If the user has indicated that an auto action based on the detected context is to be performed automatically the device takes the auto action without seeking input from the user.

In some instances logic unit may be configured to control the information flow among the units and direct the services provided by API unit input unit output unit data sources manager context processing and device manager in some example implementations described above. For example the flow of one or more processes or implementations may be controlled by logic unit alone or in conjunction with API unit .

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
