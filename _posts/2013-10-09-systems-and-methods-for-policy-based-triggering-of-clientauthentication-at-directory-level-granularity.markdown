This application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 11 462 350 entitled Systems and Methods For Policy Based Triggering of Client Authentication at Directory Level Granularity and filed on Aug. 3 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present invention generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing more granular policy based triggering of client authentication for client requests via an appliance.

In some cases a client accesses a resource on a network via a gateway. For example the client may access resources provide by a server via the gateway. In one case the client may send a request to a web server to obtain web pages or other content such as via a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP request. The client request may include a Uniform Resource Locator to request content from a web page or file located in a directory on a server. The server may include directories that are protected and unprotected. Different clients at different times may access the same resources of a server such as the protected and unprotected directories.

Typically a gateway or server authenticates a client on a server level. That is a client is authenticated to access all the resources of the server or the client is authenticated to access none of the resources of the server. However some clients may only access the unprotected directories. In this case in order to provide access to the unprotected directories the client would need to be authenticated and thus giving access to the protected directories. In other cases untrusted clients or clients connected via a virtual private network connection may try to access the protected directories. Yet other clients may access both the protected and unprotected directories. In additional cases different types of clients with different types of users may try to access the protected directories. Since the gateway provides a server level of authentication access to these resources only all or nothing access can be provided in controlling these different clients and users.

It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods to providing finer control of triggering client authentication policies based on client requests.

The appliance of the present invention provides a solution to controlling access by different clients to protected directories or to resources desired to be secured. The appliance provides fine grained triggering of client authentication policy actions based on content and information identified via client requests. The appliance can apply client authentication policies on a per request basis and per client basis. The client authentication policy may indicate to request a certificate from the client or establish or re establish a Secure Socket Layer SSL session. Any portion of the client request may be used to trigger a client authentication request from the appliance to the client. For example any URL pattern types of functions or methods identified in the request or internet protocol addresses and ports identified by the request may be used to trigger a client authentication policy. Using any portion of the client request allows fine grain client authentication policies to be configured which enables the appliance to provide fine grain access control to protected resources. Before providing access to a network or server the appliance can trigger these authentication actions and validate the client. As such the appliance can control maintain and protect the level of access to resources accessed via the gateway for a wide variety of client access scenarios. The appliance can be useful in protecting against attacks and probing or zombie clients.

In one aspect the present invention is related to a method for an appliance to authenticate access of a client to a protected resource on a server via the appliance. The method includes receiving by an appliance a client request to access a protected resource of a server and determining by the appliance a portion of the client request matches a corresponding specification of a client authentication policy of the appliance. The method also includes queuing by the appliance the client request upon determining the portion of the client request matches the client authentication policy. The appliance determines the client authentication policy identifies an action to request an authentication certificate from the client in order to access the server via the appliance. In response to the client authentication policy the appliance transmits a request to the client for an authentication certificate.

In one embodiment the method include determining by the appliance one or more of the following portions of the client request matches a corresponding specification of the client authentication policy 1 a Uniform Resource Locator URL pattern 2 an identifier of one of a method or function 3 a directory 4 a client network identifier 5 a server network identifier 6 a network port and 7 a Secure Socket Layer SSL parameter. In some embodiments the client authentication policy identifies a pattern for associating a portion of the client request with the client authentication policy. In another embodiment the method also includes comprising determining by the appliance the client has been previously authenticated to access the protected resource and allowing access by the appliance to the protected resource. In some embodiments the method includes preventing by the appliance establishment of a transport layer connection with the server.

In another embodiment the client authentication policy specifies that the authentication certificate is mandatory. In these embodiments upon receiving an invalid authentication certificate or not receiving an authentication certificate the appliance does not transmit the client request to the server. In other embodiments the client authentication policy specifies that the authentication certificate is optional. In these embodiments the appliance transmits the client request to the server upon not receiving an authentication certificate from the client or receiving an invalid authentication certificate from the client. In one embodiment the method includes inserting by the appliance into the client request a portion of the client s response to the request for the authentication certificate and transmitting the client request to the server. In yet another embodiment the method includes inserting by the appliance in response to the client authentication policy data related to the authentication certificate into a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP header of the client request and transmitting the client request to the server. In some embodiments the method includes inserting by the appliance in response to the client authentication policy Secure Socket Layer SSL information into a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP header of the client request and transmitting the client request to the server.

In another aspect the present invention is related to an appliance for providing finer control for authenticating access of a client to a protected resource on a server. The appliance includes means for receiving a client request to access a protected resource of a server and for determining a portion of the client request matches a corresponding specification of a client authentication policy of the appliance. The appliance also includes means for queuing the client request upon determining the portion of the client request matches the client authentication policy and determining the client authentication policy identifies an action to request an authentication certificate from the client in order to access the server via the appliance. The appliance also includes means for transmitting in response to the client authentication policy a request to the client for an authentication certificate.

In some embodiments the appliance determines one or more of the following portions of the client request matches a corresponding specification of the client authentication policy a Uniform Resource Locator URL pattern an identifier of one of a method or function a directory a client network identifier a server network identifier a network port and a Secure Socket Layer SSL parameter. In some embodiments the client authentication policy identifies a pattern for associating a portion of the client request with the client authentication policy. In another embodiment the appliance determines the client has been previously authenticated to access the protected resource and allowing access by the appliance to the protected resource.
