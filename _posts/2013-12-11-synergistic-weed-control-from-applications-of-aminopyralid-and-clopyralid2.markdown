This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 737 413 filed Dec. 14 2012 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to herbicidal compositions comprising a synergistically herbicidal effective amount of a aminopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof and b clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof. The present disclosure also relates to methods for controlling undesirable vegetation.

Many recurring problems in agriculture involve controlling growth of undesirable vegetation that can for instance inhibit crop growth. To help control undesirable vegetation researchers have produced a variety of chemicals and chemical formulations effective in controlling such unwanted growth. However a continuing need exists for new compositions and methods to control growth of undesirable vegetation.

Herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a number are in commercial use. In some cases herbicidal active ingredients have been found more effective in combination than when applied individually and this is referred to as synergy or synergism. The present disclosure is based on the discovery that a aminopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof and b clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof display a synergistic herbicidal effect when applied in combination.

Accordingly the present disclosure relates to herbicidal compositions comprising a synergistically herbicidal effective amount of a aminopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof and b clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof. In some embodiments a includes the potassium salt of aminopyralid. In some embodiments b includes clopyralid olamine. In some embodiments the herbicidal composition is for crop use. The acid equivalent weight ratio of a to b can be less than 1 2. In some embodiments the acid equivalent weight ratio of a to b is 1 600 to 1 6 e.g. from 1 150 to 1 30 . In some embodiments the composition further comprises an additional pesticide e.g. aminocyclopyrachlor amicarbazone 4 aminopicolinic acids bromoxynil chlorsulfuron 2 4 D dicamba dichlorprop P diclosulam diuron florasulam flucarbazone sodium flumetsulam fluoroxypyr glyphosate glufosinate imazamox imazapyr imazapic imazaquin imazethapyr imazamethabenz indaziflam ioxynil MCPA mecoprop P metsulfuron methyl oxyfluorfen penoxsulam picloram pinoxaden pyroxsulam rimsulfuron sulfometuron thifensulfuron methyl tebuthiuron tribenuron methyl triclopyr or agriculturally acceptable salts or esters or mixtures thereof . The additional pesticide can include 2 4 D choline salt triclopyr choline salt or a mixture thereof. In some embodiments the composition is free of naptalam and salts and esters thereof. In some embodiments the composition further comprises a herbicidal safener an agriculturally acceptable adjuvant or carrier or a combination thereof.

The present disclosure also relates to methods of controlling undesirable vegetation which comprise applying to vegetation or an area adjacent the vegetation or applying to soil or water to prevent the emergence or growth of vegetation a aminopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof and b clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof wherein a and b are each added in an amount sufficient to produce a synergistic herbicidal effect. In some embodiments a and b are applied simultaneously. In some embodiments a and b are applied postemergence to the undesirable vegetation. The undesirable vegetation can be controlled in for instance barley canola cereal corn mint mustard seed oats spinach sugar beet turnips or wheat. In some embodiments the undesirable vegetation is a broadleaf weed e.g. nightshade . The undesirable vegetation can be controlled in crops tolerant to glyphosate glufosinate dicamba phenoxy auxins pyridyloxy auxins aryloxyphenoxypropionates acetyl CoA carboxylase ACCase inhibitors imidazolinones acetolactate synthase ALS inhibitors 4 hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase HPPD inhibitors protoporphyrinogen oxidase PPO inhibitors triazines bromoxynil or combinations thereof. For example the undesired vegetation can be controlled in phenoxy acid tolerant crops and the phenoxy acid tolerant crops have tolerance conferred by an AAD12 gene. In some embodiments the undesirable vegetation is resistant to auxinic herbicides. In some embodiments a is applied in an amount of from 0.1 10 grams of acid equivalent per hectare g ae ha e.g. 0.5 3 g ae ha . In some embodiments b is applied in an amount of from 20 300 g ae ha e.g. from 60 90 g ae ha .

The a aminopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof is mixed with or applied in combination with b clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof in an amount sufficient to induce a synergistic herbicidal effect. In some embodiments a and b are used in an amount sufficient to induce a synergistic herbicidal effect while still showing good crop compatibility i.e. their use in crops does not result in increased damage to crops when compared to the individual application of the herbicidal compounds a or b . As described in the of the Weed Science Society of America Ninth Edition 2007 p. 429 synergism is an interaction of two or more factors such that the effect when combined is greater than the predicted effect based on the response to each factor applied separately. Synergistic in the herbicide context can mean that the use of a and b as defined above results in an increased weed control effect compared to the weed control effects that are possible with the use of a or b alone. In some embodiments the damage or injury to the undesired vegetation caused by the compositions and methods disclosed herein is evaluated using a scale from 0 to 100 when compared with the untreated control vegetation wherein 0 indicates no damage to the undesired vegetation and 100 indicates complete destruction of the undesired vegetation. In some embodiments Colby s formula is applied to determine whether using a and b in combination shows a synergistic effect S. R. Colby W15 p. 22 1967 

X effect in percent using a aminopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof at an application rate a 

Y effect in percent using b clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof at an application rate b 

In Colby s equation the value E corresponds to the effect plant damage or injury that is to be expected if the activity of the individual compounds is additive. If the observed effect is higher than the value E calculated according to the Colby equation then a synergistic effect is present according to the Colby equation.

In some embodiments the compositions and methods disclosed herein are synergistic as defined by the Colby equation. In some embodiments the joint action of aminopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof and clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof results in enhanced activity against undesired vegetation via synergism even at application rates below those typically used for the pesticide to have a herbicidal effect on its own. In some embodiments the compositions and methods disclosed herein can based on the individual components be used at lower application rates to achieve a herbicidal effect comparable to the effect produced by the individual components at normal application rates. In some embodiments the compositions and methods disclosed herein provide an accelerated action on undesired vegetation i.e. they effect damaging of undesired vegetation more quickly compared with application of the individual herbicides .

In some embodiments the acid equivalent weight ratio of a aminopyralid or agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof to b clopyralid or an agriculturally acceptable salt or ester thereof that is sufficient to induce a synergistic herbicidal effect is at least 1 600 e.g. at least 1 550 at least 1 500 at least 1 450 at least 1 400 at least 1 350 at least 1 300 at least 1 250 at least 1 200 at least 1 150 at least 1 140 at least 1 130 at least 1 120 at least 1 110 at least 1 100 at least 1 90 at least 1 80 at least 1 70 at least 1 60 at least 1 50 at least 1 40 at least 1 30 at least 1 25 at least 1 20 at least 1 15 at least 1 12 at least 1 10 at least 1 9 at least 1 8 or at least 1 7 . In some embodiments the acid equivalent weight ratio of a to b that is sufficient to induce a synergistic herbicidal effect is less than 1 2 or less e.g. 1 3 or less 1 4 or less 1 5 or less 1 6 or less 1 7 or less 1 8 or less 1 9 or less 1 10 or less 1 12 or less 1 15 or less 1 20 or less 1 25 or less 1 30 or less 1 35 or less 1 40 or less 1 45 or less 1 50 or less 1 60 or less 1 70 or less 1 80 or less 1 90 or less 1 100 or less 1 125 or less 1 150 or less 1 175 or less 1 200 or less 1 250 or less 1 300 or less 1 350 or less 1 400 or less 1 450 or less 1 500 or less or 1 550 or less . In some embodiments the acid equivalent weight ratio of a to b is from 1 600 to 1 6 e.g. from 1 425 to 1 10 from 1 350 to 1 15 from 1 275 to 1 20 from 1 200 to 1 25 from 1 150 to 1 30 from 1 125 to 1 35 from 1 100 to 1 40 or from 1 80 to 1 50 .
