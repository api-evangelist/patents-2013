A system and method for a revolutionary development platform and management system using intelligent control rooms hereafter referred to the system represents a foundational change in management software. The system uses a groundbreaking framework for the design build control and operation of an enterprise s management data and human reporting. It provides both operational knowledge and quality assurance. It has two primary purposes 

Searches for intelligent control room and software development platform return zero results in the United States Patent and Trade Office databases. This testifies to the revolutionary nature of this systems concept. Searches for the much broader topic of intelligent control room software yield only seven results. The U.S. Pat. No. 7 786 371 entitled Modular system for MIDI data which is one of the returned results deals only with Rack mountable user programmable electronic modules. 

Public domain searches also reveal that this concept is both new and revolutionary. Internet searches using Google return references like Intelligent Control Room Management for Oil and Gas at http www.ge ip.com products intelligent control room management for oil and gas p3583. These merely seek to implement specific idiosyncratically designed implementations of regulations and standards such as in this solution which states that it addresses all aspects of RIN 2137 AE28 Pipeline Safety Control Room Management Human Factors Regulations. 

Other references such as the NetBeans Platform Showcase show software development objects in a library that have no relationship to generic control room functions and customization of those functions without programming.

The system achieves its revolutionary flexibility and extensibility of functionality through individual intelligent control rooms that are easily designed and built into a comprehensive network of composite business intelligence and human reporting. As an integrated repository of human knowledge within the enterprise the system is a bold new approach to effective management. It drives knowledge across the enterprise and retools management to reside closer to the operational process. The system provides tremendous opportunity for transparency in our mobile social and highly integrated world.

Leveraging human capital best practices quality assurance QA and Six Sigma techniques are critical success factors in any enterprise. Your management control system MCS is the way you implement these. Your MCS must be as simple to implement and set up as a spreadsheet or checklist in order to be used and be effective. The goals of an MCS are 

Most enterprises are made up of collections of management units. Usually this is a department work group or other similar organization unit. These operating cells have their own rules of engagement that focus on how work is accomplished. The information that the cell uses to manage itself contains both hard data such as key performance indicators KPIs along with other numerical data and soft data such as opinions perspectives and similar human knowledge about the enterprise and the work at hand. Soft data sometimes comprises Everyone knows . . . knowledge items and sometimes status information and opinion conveyed verbally or in writing.

The system is the most advanced concept in MCSs. It is an easy to modify construct that accepts rules procedures data and information from the enterprise. It uses a conceptual control unit that manages this flow of hard and soft information. The system readily automates and institutionalizes both the objective empirical and subjective human knowledge needed to optimally manage the enterprise. The integration of business rules checklists advice etc. is married with the operational flow of data. This interrelation of hard and soft data provides the most accurate qualified and meaningful information.

What is an intelligent control room To begin with let s look at what drives the need for an intelligent control room. A great management system must identify gather and use knowledge across the enterprise. It must do this as automatously and automatically as possible to ensure workforce optimization. This knowledge occurs in the form of books best practices rules of engagement checklists etc. There are endless elements of knowledge that must constantly be moved into the elemental working cells of an enterprise. Then it must be confirmed that it is being leveraged to its fullest. Management systems of the future need to be cognizant of both this flow of information through the enterprise and through the management system itself. They must widen this knowledge spreading and pushing it throughout the enterprise. Leveraging knowledge has consistently proven to have a significant return on investment ROI for any organization and now more than ever is absolutely necessary for future survival.

To accomplish this a necessary operational component for a management system is the use of an intelligent control room. An intelligent control room sits above the source data constantly monitoring readings from all systems. It has access to all the information. It has knowledge and algorithms about why criteria are too high or too low or varies too much according to readings and algorithms. Its first job is to be a canary in the mine to provide warnings of danger based on sensory perception. An intelligent control room however is much more sophisticated than a canary. It s not just a reactionary warning to current or pending conditions.

The continual increase of knowledge coupled with having the right intelligence embedded within the system makes intelligent control rooms more sophisticated over time. The system s intelligent control room is aware of past performance as it measures current operating conditions and potential danger to the business. This historical perspective allows the system to predict future trends. As intelligent control rooms become more intelligent their ability to predict outcomes increases. Accurately predicting outcomes of operations processes projects etc. is a nirvana like goal for any enterprise. The system is the first software to introduce the concept of similarly intelligent controls rooms that promote enhanced workforce efficiency and effectiveness with greater product and service quality assurance. The system is the future of management systems.

Imagine an instantly configurable pipeline for information that was capable of flowing to any of the management cells of an enterprise. The system takes this concept one step further by applying the concept of a best manager or best consultant function as a control unit on this pipeline. This expert consultant constantly 

Intelligent Control Rooms thus provide a unique opportunity to apply internal and external knowledge to operational activities. They blend historical data with current knowledge and predict future courses of action. The system enhances the sharing of information and provides agility in intelligent control rooms that allow rules and reasoning procedures to be adapted as needs dictate. An individual manager can establish new perceptive qualifiers at any time expanding or transcending the current paradigm of monitoring and control. This is the future of management systems where the frame of management capabilities is greatly enlarged allowing for the total transparency of the operational environment.

The system s intelligent control room is a bottom up model where every single entity uses an intelligent control room and shares its information across the organization. The system s intelligent control rooms are easy to implement just like plugging an air filter or carbon monoxide detector into every room in your house.

The system s intelligent control rooms and knowledge flow are not implemented in a traditional computer system fashion. Historically decades have been spent doing analysis and architecting management information systems. This was followed by years writing programming and testing them. After a certain level of success was accomplished these remained frozen at heart information systems making changes difficult and time consuming. They stifled the flexibility needed to remain competitive.

Managers need an implementation method that is as easy to use as a spreadsheet and allows a manager to build an intelligent control room quickly. The system enables managers to quickly define the data the rules and what these mean to a specific organization unit. The manager can easily modify dashboards events rules etc. with the same simplicity of modifying a spreadsheet. This enables intelligent control rooms to be built without the need of a computer engineer. The manager understands what their business needs are. The manager understands the data. They are the one who needs to be able to define it and use it to manage the cell.

Imagine that you can build an intelligent control room to monitor your organization unit whatever its size. Every manager in the organization can set up one for their unit. Each intelligent control room is like a LEGO piece. You simply snap them together into a coherent integrated system. The assembled structure is able to leverage the collective awareness of ALL intelligent control rooms. An intelligent control room at any location in the structure is instantly aware of potential problems anywhere else in the enterprise. This is true ubiquity of information.

The system s ability to combine intelligent control rooms into higher order more complex management groupings is at the heart of its value proposition. This inherent strength of the system s model and its ability to network all cells in the enterprise allows the system to keep pace as an organization changes. These changes can occur in the form of mergers and acquisitions or by extending the model to incorporate entities previously excluded from the system. They can also occur when a management cell splits into smaller ones.

The system allows for an infinite number of control rooms. With increased complexity the guidance available is much more than the sum of its parts. The system allows managers to leverage the human insight of the A players so that others can function on their same level. When we add formal and informal systemized knowledge relevant to the operation of the management cell we can achieve better outcomes with fewer resources. We do so by 

Providing the ability for true management review and governance without the time consuming efforts of needing to form a management picture of the past

Making all this easy to modify by formalizing the cell model in an intelligent control room environment

The system creates an infinitely open architecture that automates human knowledge across an enterprise. The system in effect automates knowledge across the known universe while simultaneously anticipating the unknown.

The system is a revolutionary development platform for quickly building powerful enterprise information systems.

Fully developed solutions are already designed for the IT and supply chain domains. With expert analysis best practices and assessments built in you can be up and running in a matter of days.

The system allows for a unique flow of data. See . Valuable data lost to other applications can flow continuously into the system from both operational application sources and human feedback. Unlike other tools the system allows for seamless integration between this hard data and human feedback in real time. This provides unparalleled visibility into the enterprise. The system brings to light all aspects of the organization s operations both the positive aspects and the ones requiring improvement. The system can tell you what is working what is not working why these are occurring and what should and is being done about it. Furthermore the system filters analyzes and organizes this data through layers of all the best thinking and practices. The system uniquely combines knowledge and experience quality checklists and best practices and comprehensive team communications into a successful formula ensuring visibility control and governance. The system captures all this data with a single easy to use interface. The system then makes all this data available through interactive dashboards with complete drill down and analysis capabilities in a secure fashion to all qualified personnel. You can also customize reports with the tools of your choice. Furthermore the system builds a repository of your data for benchmarking comparison and historical analysis.

The system follows a sophisticated strategy for software as a service SAAS by utilizing a well defined 4 tier architecture governing its design deployment and operation. See . A multi tiered SAAS architecture is a generally accepted standard for modern application design and deployment.

The system s architectural tiers rest on a foundation of one of the most extensible data structures every defined that allows new entities to be defined for customers on the fly. New domains of data can be added as an organization s understanding evolves or the enterprise adapts itself to new customer demands and a changing operational environment. The system s advanced data envisioning concept allows entities and relationships to be defined for a customer s unique needs without additional relational data definition language specification or application programming code development. This enables the domain of the system to be whatever the customer needs it to be. This makes the system a distinctively flexible solution platform. The system uses the power of Microsoft s SQL Server relational database management system RDBMS to provide the best possible power performance and reliability of data.

On top of this tier resides the system application code base. The system code is generically structured so that there is little or no need to create additional application code to support a customer s individual needs. The code is divided into two major categories. First is the system base code that contains all the system level functionality of the system. The primary functions of maintaining data for necessary elements like people organizations roles etc. are also located here. Additional code elements power the functionality for defining new data elements and associated functionality. The second category of code deals with specific data navigation and built in behavior for a specific solution built on the system s platform.

Above this sits the knowledge cartridge. This is where all the content authored by experts resides. This tier is the engine of instructions for the system. It is the workflow the rules the equations and calculations for analysis the alerts the key point indicators KPIs questions and dashboards defined by the acknowledged professionals that drive the system s data flow and actions. Separating out this tier offers a world class development platform to experts so that best of breed solutions can be created without additional and time consuming programming. Powerful solutions are easily developed in market verticals.

Finally above all is the system s client configuration tier which holds four categories the customer s own configuration the system s built in configuration the user s preferences and client extended data definitions. This interface represents a novel approach to user ergonomics. It is a world class design through which clients specific designs can be created without additional coding. Individual user preferences are tracked to promote ease of use and efficiency and clients can administer their own system with simple and natural interactions.

The Intelligent Control Room is at the heart of the system s revolutionary concept of intelligent governance. See . The intelligent control room acts like a person capturing data just as a manager would and directing actions like an expert. The intelligent control room is the beating heart or engine layer of the system. It lies at the center of the data layer and the services layer. The intelligent control room rules alerts content workflow analysis dashboards and reporting are all created through a common application layer that provides administration functions and component specific graphical user interfaces.

Intelligent control rooms are smart entities. As knowledge increases over time and history is remembered intelligent control rooms gain sophistication. This enables the system to predict future trends with ever increasing accuracy. The system can implement similarly intelligent controls rooms. These promote enhanced workforce efficiency and effectiveness by ensuring greater product and service quality assurance. These intelligent control rooms are capable of flowing this information to any of the management cells of an enterprise. As a part of the expert knowledge the concept of the best manager or best consultant is applied to this information in capturing the data analyzing and reporting it and directing employee activity.

The system s ability to combine intelligent control rooms into higher order more complex management groupings is a powerful aspect of continuous improvement through layered intelligence. This inherent strength of the system s model and its ability to network all cells in the enterprise allows the system to keep pace as an organization changes. These changes can occur in the form of mergers and acquisitions or by extending the model to incorporate entities previously excluded from the system or they can occur when a management cell splits into smaller ones. The system also allows for an infinite number of these intelligent control rooms or layers.

The intelligent control room is a critical function for sophisticated governance. Intelligent control rooms enable applications to become more intelligent and interact with humans in a more natural way at a higher level. They also add substantial further benefit in that they handle mundane human behavior automatically by predetermined behavioral rules. The way this concept is applied is unique to the system. It is a more sophisticated layer with its own intelligence and logic on top of other transactional systems. This powerful construct allows humans to see a broader view of the total system s operation and controlling elements that effect strategic operations.

The system s feature set is incredibly rich in its function set and deep in its utility. It allows everything from 3party application programming interface API s and benchmarking capability serviced through the data layer to common administration functions serviced through the application layer that support additional built in components and other 3party applications to integrate seamlessly with the system.

Creating a solution in the system whether simple or advanced prepackaged or consulting requires only five primary steps 

A customized solution in the system has only a few extra steps. In addition to collecting stakeholder feedback through targeted questionnaires you can for example pull in data from your existing systems for correlation and analysis. From this you can 

A growing number of packaged industry specific applications are available for the system. These solutions come bundled with defined data collection and analysis questions answers metrics and placeholders for external data. Ready for immediate implementation packaged solutions allow organizations to throw out the development cycle and be up and running within days.

The system is designed to leverage a partner channels and crowd sourcing to develop core solutions that are deployed with most of the data collection and analysis predefined. Implementation involves defining remaining organization specific data elements required along with dashboards and reports to accommodate customer reporting requirements.

Using the system as a platform it is possible to develop the ultimate complete highly customized executive information system to meet the unique needs of a particular organization. This system 

To implement this level of system is naturally a greater effort. Still the system simplifies this work reducing it to easily understood steps which include 

The technology architectures provide a logical description of the infrastructure and system components that is necessary to support the system. While there can be many perspectives of the enterprise architecture the following specific architectural perspectives are addressed here 

The Application Architecture is the architecture of any automated services that supports and implements functional requirements including the interfaces to the business and other applications. It describes the structure of an application and how that structure implements the functional requirements of the organization. The Operational Requirements Define the reliability manageability performance security and interoperability requirements of the software to list just a few . The Technical Architecture The architecture of the hardware and software infrastructure that supports the organization and implements the operational or non functional requirements particularly the application and information architectures of the organization. It describes the structure and inter relationships of the technologies used and how those technologies support the operational requirements of the organization.

The system utilizes a service oriented approach. Service oriented architectures SOA employ an architectural concept that defines the use of services to support business requirements. In a service oriented architecture clients consume services rather than invoking discreet method calls directly. An SOA aims to solve the problem of distributed application development. A service can be described as an application that exposes a message based asynchronous interface encapsulates its data and manages ACID Atomic Consistent Isolated Durable transactions within its data sources.

Generally SOA is defined as a set of service providers that expose their functionality through public interfaces. The interfaces exposed by the service providers can then be individually consumed or aggregated into composite service providers. The SOA is implemented in the system as SOAP based web services. SOA is rooted in object orientation but adds a layer of abstraction. It is not a departure from object orientation but rather an evolution.

In a service oriented model we introduce a further layer of indirection . This alleviates some of the pain associated with traversing complex object models. The services layer denoted in the diagram below by the cloud provides black box functionality. See .

The system employs Web services as a vehicle for the implementation of services in general. Web services applications are built upon platform independent protocols SOAP WSDL UDDI and HTTP. Because of the abstraction the service layer provides the presentation layer supports the following 

Smart applications with rich user experiences solutions that interact with one or many services intelligently cache the information they retrieve and deliver both great interactivity and support for offline information processing.

Smart devices solutions from self service kiosks to inventory tracking on handhelds to contact management on smart phones.

Web user interface UI enterprise portal solutions that unify and coordinate business employee and group group interactions.

To clarify SOA is a design principle whose goal is to achieve loose coupling among interacting software agents whereas web services are an implementation technology.

A good architecture emphasizes a separation of responsibilities. This is achieved by dividing the application into layers where each layer should only communicate with the layer s contiguous to it. By designing different tiers it is possible to reconfigure the application to meet a number of architectural or configuration demands.

Separating the application into layers also isolates each major area of functionality. The presentation is independent of the business logic which is separate from the data.

Interface logic. It is a client of the main server environment even though the logic runs on a server behind the firewall. The Web application along with other clients accesses the business and data functionality through a service fa ade layer.

Configuring the system in this way has the advantage of allowing all user interface elements whether it s the web application or rich clients to come into the system through the same standardized interface. See .

The following sections will drill down deeper into the design of the architecture focusing on each layer s responsibilities.

The Web Application architecture is structured around the MVC Model View Controller design pattern. MVC is a fundamental design pattern for the separation of user interface logic from business logic. The MVC pattern separates the modeling of the domain the presentation and the actions based on user input into three separate classes 

Model This object knows all about the data to be displayed and is responsible for managing the data and the actions of the application. It can be thought of as the processing part of an input process output system.

View This object manages the information displayed to users. Multiple views can be used to display the same information in different ways. It can be thought of as the output part of an input process output system.

Controller This object allows the user to interact with the application. It takes input from the user and passes instructions to the model. In the input process output system this is the input part.

Use the same programming model for the code that manages control flow and state for different types of applications including Windows based applications Web applications and device applications.

Developers create new views or ASP.NET pages that inherit from a parent view called a Master Page. Each new controller may handle the interaction with the Web Services Layer for one or more views.

In line with the SOA paradigm the Web Service layer implements a Fa ade Pattern to hide the complexities of dealing with the business service layer. The Fa ade Pattern presents a simple way into the system for client applications. By having a separate fa ade layer we make sure the business services logic is organized so that it can perform its duties more effectively. illustrates this point.

The current industry work on standards around UDDI WSDL Web Services etc. promises that more and more applications can be constructed from constituent services rather than re invented domain specific code.

It is important to note that although the Facade simplifies the use of the required subsystem it only deals with a subset of the original system. Therefore certain functionality may be unavailable to the client through a fa ade. In these cases extra functionality would be provided by either extending an existing fa ade class or creating a new one.

Whereas services typically expose only coarse processes the business service layer encapsulates atomic business operations that can be orchestrated by the fa ade or by other business units. Business logic generally includes any logic associated with providing some service. Business logic includes all logic related to workflow business processing and business rules. Each Business Logic Component deals with a specific type of business entity. Extracting the business rules into their own classes encapsulates business rules allowing developers direct access to those rules.

The goal is to create business routines with internal integrity strong cohesion and small direct visible and flexible relations to other routines loose coupling .

On occasion one business layer will need to know about another business layer. Creating cross references between business layers can be tricky. At some point you may end up with a circular reference and this is where orchestration layers come in to play. Orchestration layers provide the ability for two subsystems to know about it but not each other. shows two autonomous assemblies coming together to fulfill a business need via an orchestration assembly.

The complete encapsulation of data access is an important tenet of the system. This is the main purposes of the Data Access Layer DAL . The Data Access Layer components provide methods to perform the following tasks upon a database on behalf of the caller 

Typically each Data Access Logic Component encapsulates the data related operations for a single table or a group of related tables in the database. For example we have defined one Data Access Logic Component to deal with the Project and Project related tables in a database and another Data Access Logic Component to deal with the Questionnaire tables. Whenever a Project Information is required by a business routine the system must retrieve the Project data through Project Data Access Component.

This approach not only supports high cohesion within the Data Access Layer but it also minimizes the number of joins in corresponding stored procedures thereby improving performance.

The data access components are implemented per data store. For example a SQL Server data access component will be able to access SQL Server stores while an Oracle data access component will be able to access Oracle stores. This is done via a generic Data Access Helper Component. illustrates this process.

The system uses DataSets with column names that are identical to the column names of tables in the database. The reasons for choosing this approach are twofold. First the strongly typed DataSets that are used in the APO system are generated from stored procedures in Visual Studio. Second this approach saved development time by allowing developers to avoid having to create a mapping object for each Data Access method.

The system implements a data interface abstraction layer that separates the logic of the application from the functions that retrieve data from a database. This abstraction is achieved through the concept of polymorphism through interfaces . The Data Abstraction Layer which is really a sub layer within the Data Access Layer is responsible for creating the appropriate Data Access Object at runtime and returning the interface for that object to the caller which will be a business service class .

This strategy supports programming to interfaces not implementations which is a very common and important construct of object oriented design. This design essentially abstracts the business layer from the data access layer.

In developing this Data Access Layer the team s primary goals are to maximize performance and reusability and to minimize complexity and maintenance. When developing Data Access components the following rules should be adhered to 

When in doubt use context to determine where the Data Access for join tables should be placed. For example the method that retrieves Project Question Set data is placed in the Project DAL component since the relationship is in the context of a particular project.

Most applications require data to be passed between components. For example in the system a list of projects must be passed from the data access logic components to the user interface components so that the project list can be displayed to the users. The data is used to represent real world business entities such as Projects or Portfolios.

XML You use an XML string or an XML Document Object Model DOM object to represent business entity data. XML is an open and flexible data representation format that can be used to integrate diverse types of applications.

Un Typed DataSet A DataSet is an in memory cache of tables obtained from a relational database or an XML document. A Data Access Logic Component can use a DataSet to represent business entity data retrieved from the database and you can use the DataSet in your application. Typed DataSet A typed DataSet is a class that inherits from the ADO.NET DataSet class and provides strongly typed methods events and properties to access the tables and columns in a DataSet. Business Entity Component This is a custom class to represent each type of business entity. You define fields to hold the business entity data and you define properties to expose this data to the client application. You define methods to encapsulate simple business logic making use of the fields defined in the class. This option does not implement CRUD methods as pass through methods to the underlying Data Access Logic Component the client application communicates directly with the Data Access Logic Component to perform CRUD operations. Business Entity Component with CRUD behaviors You define a custom entity class as described previously and you implement the CRUD methods that call the underlying Data Access Logic Component associated with this business entity.

A very important issue when designing a business layer is how to manage transactions. Many business methods call multiple DAL methods internally to update insert or delete multiple records potentially in multiple tables. Multiple calls must run within a transaction so that if one fails all actions performed by previous methods are rolled back. Otherwise data will be inconsistent and or incorrect. We use the System.Transactions namespace that provides a modem managed interface to handle transactions.

Transactional context is managed by the root and Web service methods act as the root of a distributed transaction. If an exception is thrown while the XML Web service method is executing the transaction is automatically aborted conversely if no exception occurs the transaction is automatically committed.

Each object enlisted by the Web method is a child object and will participate in the transaction and vote on the outcome. This provides the best fit for keeping objects granular enough to manage their own data from a persistent store while still allowing them to be orchestrated by a transaction root controller. Child objects need nothing special. The same child object can be enlisted in a transaction for one Web method but not be enlisted in a transaction for another Web method.

Service Oriented Architecture Microsoft IBM and VeriSign have jointly published a specification called WS Security that is designed to deal specifically with the issues surrounding Web service security.

WCF is a rich technology platform for building distributed systems unifying messaging style and RPC style communication efficient platform optimized binary communication and open standard based Web services and a rich set of features enabling robust security scalable and reliable communication paths and transactional processing.

The system uses user password authentication tokens to authorize clients. This security layer prevents the web service methods from being invoked from a non trusted source. It is also possible to implement a LDAP AD scenario and fully supports a single node LDAP configuration for authentication.

When errors occur in .NET applications the general advice is to throw exceptions rather than return error values from your methods. This advice has implications for the data access business service and web service layers along with the business entity components. There are two general kinds of exceptions that will occur 

The system only catches exceptions when it needs to specifically perform any of the following actions 

There are two main processes for handling exceptions. illustrates the basic steps that the system performs to handle an exception.

This process continues to occur as an exception propagates up the call stack. Any errors that occur within the system are propagated up to the Web Service level where they are handled. Please note that all try catch blocks are implemented in the Web Services Layer not in the Business Logic or Data Access Layers .

The system uses the Exception Management Application Block EMAB . The EMAB is an application block designed to publish exception information. Publishing might involve recording the exception s details to a database paging the system administrator adding an entry to the Event Log or some other custom task. The point is with the EMAB developers can indicate precisely what publishing an exception involves. This approach also prevents code from being tightly coupled with behavior since the exception publishing action is encapsulated in a separate class.

At times it makes sense to embed third party applications or assemblies into an application instead of inventing them yourself. The system does implement a third party product to fulfill a very specific business need of dashboarding and reporting.

Those skilled in the art who have reviewed the present disclosure will readily appreciate that the system and methods defined above can be implemented on a variety of computer hardware and software. The communication within the solutions domain can take place over the Internet an intranet or any other suitable network. The key differentiators of the system and methods are as follows 

 a it is a fundamentally revolutionary approach to generically implementing an intelligent control room philosophy in software systems and

The preferred embodiment of the invention has been described in detail above. Those skilled in the art who have reviewed the present disclosure will readily appreciate that the features of the invention can be implemented in a different order from that disclosed herein.
