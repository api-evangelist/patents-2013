title: Familiarity modeling
abstract: One or more embodiments of techniques or systems for modeling familiarity for a traveler are provided herein. Familiarity evidence can be received, indicative of how familiar a traveler is with an area or road segment, and based on a number of visits the traveler has made to that area. The familiarity evidence can be used to generate one or more familiarity models indicative of a predicted familiarity of locations around the area. Familiarity models can be based on kernels, graph distances, Markov random fields (MRFs), etc. When route directions are generated from an origin location to a destination location, one or more of the directions can be provided based on one or more of the familiarity models. For example, if a familiarity model indicates that a traveler is familiar with a route, driving directions of the route can be adapted to be more succinct.

Generally vehicles can have telematics components such as global positioning system GPS units. GPS technology can be integrated with computers and mobile communications in an automotive navigation system. For example a GPS device can determine a location for the GPS device and record corresponding location data at an interval. The recorded location data can be stored within the GPS device or transmitted to a third party such as a computer or a server.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to be an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

One or more embodiments of techniques or systems for modeling familiarity for a traveler are provided herein. Familiarity evidence for a traveler such as a driver of a vehicle is generally indicative of a level of familiarity the traveler has with an area road segment city route traffic patterns construction patterns time dependent information associated therewith etc. In one or more embodiments familiarity evidence can be received as global positioning system GPS data. As an example the GPS data may be collected from one or more sources such as a telematics unit or component on a vehicle or a mobile device. Often a driver can travel to a location along a route a city a neighborhood a geographical area etc. As such familiarity evidence can include one or more familiarity scores for such locations routes cities neighborhoods geographical areas road segments etc. A number of visits the traveler has made to a location can be used as a factor when determining a familiarity score. In this way familiarity data for a traveler can be compiled indicating locations or routes a traveler has visited and how familiar the traveler may be with these locations or routes.

In one or more embodiments one or more familiarity models can be generated based on the familiarity evidence or GPS data associated with a traveler. A familiarity model can include one or more predicted familiarity scores. These predicted familiarity scores can be determined for locations areas road segments not included in the familiarity evidence. In other words familiarity of untraveled areas of a map can be inferred from the GPS data or the familiarity evidence. Familiarity scores can be extended or extrapolated across intersections along roads by road name neighborhood or across other features. For example if a driver travels on a segment of Main Street and also travels on a segment of Butterfield Drive an inference can be drawn that the driver may be familiar with the intersection of Main and Butterfield even when the driver has not been observed at that intersection. In this way the intersection of Main and Butterfield can be assigned a predicted familiarity score. In one or more embodiments one or more of the familiarity models can be generated using a graph distance model one or more kernels e.g. Gaussian etc. one or more Markov random fields MRFs etc.

In one or more embodiments driving directions from an origin location to a destination location can be provided based on one or more of the familiarity models. For example if a familiarity model indicates that a traveler is familiar with a portion of a route more succinct broader or higher level driving directions may be provided. In other embodiments a route from an origin location to a destination location can be selected or generated based on one or more of the familiarity models. In other words a first route may be selected for a traveler over a second route because one or more of the familiarity models predicts that the traveler is more familiar with the first route. In one or more embodiments an energy bar or a fuel level indicator can be adjusted based on one or more of the familiarity models. That is if a traveler is heading from a familiar area to an unfamiliar area the fuel level indicator of the vehicle can be configured to display a lower fuel level or energy level than estimated. This may be done to encourage a driver or traveler to fill up on fuel or recharge the vehicle prior to exploring the unfamiliar area.

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects are employed. Other aspects advantages or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

Embodiments or examples illustrated in the drawings are disclosed below using specific language. It will nevertheless be understood that the embodiments or examples are not intended to be limiting. Any alterations and modifications in the disclosed embodiments and any further applications of the principles disclosed in this document are contemplated as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.

For one or more of the figures herein one or more boundaries such as boundary of for example are drawn with different heights widths perimeters aspect ratios shapes etc. relative to one another merely for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily drawn to scale. For example because dashed or dotted lines are used to represent different boundaries if the dashed and dotted lines were drawn on top of one another they would not be distinguishable in the figures and thus are drawn with different dimensions or slightly apart from one another in one or more of the figures so that they are distinguishable from one another. As another example where a boundary is associated with an irregular shape the boundary such as a box drawn with a dashed line dotted lined etc. does not necessarily encompass an entire component in one or more instances. Conversely a drawn box does not necessarily encompass merely an associated component in one or more instances but can encompass a portion of one or more other components as well.

In one or more embodiments one or more familiarity models can be generated or calculated. These familiarity models may be used to augment navigation. At familiarity evidence can be received. Familiarity evidence may be indicative a travel pattern or historical travel data for a traveler such as a global positioning system GPS trace for example. This familiarity evidence can be used to build a familiarity model that provides insight as to how familiar the traveler may be with portions of the GPS trace. For example a driver may be more familiar with areas or road segments traveled on daily then road segments visited merely once.

At one or more familiarity models may be generated based on the familiarity evidence received at . Effectively a familiarity model can be a prediction of how familiar a traveler is or may be with an area one or more locations routes traffic patterns road segments intersections etc. A variety of familiarity models can be used as will be described in .

At navigation can be based on one or more of the familiarity models. A familiarity model can be indicative of how predictively familiar a traveler may be with a road segment intersection route or location. As an example navigation instructions may be omitted when a driver is in a familiar area. As another example when two routes are available from a first location to a second location a more familiar route of the two routes may be selected.

In one or more embodiments navigation instructions can be provided and behavior of a driver or traveler can be observed. Behavior can include one or more choices made by a traveler. The familiarity model can be modified or updated based on observed traveler behavior such as observed driving behavior. In other words observed driving behavior can be incorporated into the familiarity model thereby facilitating feedback. For example choices made by a driver as well as deviations mistakes etc. could be used to adjust the threshold for omitting directions or combining two or more sets of directions to be more high level. That is if a driver fails to follow a high level direction a threshold associated with those directions could be lowered and more detailed directions provided. In this way the familiarity model or a generation system used to generate driving directions can be tuned.

As an example a GPS trace can be indicative of a traveler s familiarity with a set of one or more road segments. Additionally this familiarity can be based on a frequency of travel associated with one or more of the road segments. For example if a driver travels on a first road or road segment on a daily basis it can be determined that the driver may be more familiar with the first road segment than a second road segment that the driver has only traveled on once.

In one or more embodiments familiarity evidence can include additional data or information relevant to a traveler s familiarity with a road segment or road. For example familiarity evidence can include whether infotainment was active while a traveler was travelling along a road segment or through an intersection. That is if a driver has entertainment or may potentially be distracted such as by a radio etc. the level of familiarity of the driver may be affected by the distraction. In other words if a driver is travelling along a road or road segment and has the stereo at a high volume it may be inferred that the driver or traveler is less familiar with that road segment than if the stereo was off for example.

In one or more embodiments familiarity evidence can be collected by detecting one or more passengers in a vehicle. For example if a traveler or driver has an infant in the vehicle the traveler may not be as focused on a surrounding driving environment. Accordingly a familiarity score for a corresponding road segment may be lower than a scenario where no passengers are in the vehicle. In other embodiments familiarity evidence can include time of day in relation to sunrise and sunset. For example a traveler may typically travel along a route during the daytime when sunlight is more abundant. This may mean that the traveler is more familiar with the route during the daytime and less familiar with the route at nighttime. Familiarity evidence or familiarity scores can be assigned accordingly. Additionally familiarity evidence can include one or more road characteristics as will be described with reference to for example.

Similarly familiarity evidence can include the presence of other passengers e.g. indicated by seat belt buckled weight sensors etc. . Further familiarity evidence can include a traveler response to a survey such as How familiar are you with the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue on a scale from 1 to 5 In this way familiarity evidence can be gathered where the familiarity evidence can include aspects relating to potential distractions for a traveler. In other embodiments the familiarity evidence can include how recently a traveler passed through an intersection or along a road segment. That is if a traveler has not traveled along a road for years the traveler may not be as familiar with that road as other roads traveled on daily for example. According to one or more aspects familiarity evidence can include a profile of a traveler familiarity with alternate routes historical driving information route choices historical departure times driving speeds along of the traveler along the route etc.

In one or more embodiments a collection component can be configured to receive familiarity evidence associated with one or more road segments of a map and one or more intersections of the map. One or more intersections of the map can be connected by one or more of the road segments of the map. In this way familiarity evidence for a traveler can be collected where the familiarity evidence can indicate whether or not a traveler has traveled on one or more of the road segments whether or not the traveler has passed through one or more of the intersections how frequently the traveler has traveled on one or more of the road segments how frequently the traveler has passed through one or more of the intersections etc. Accordingly familiarity evidence can be indicative of a frequency of how often or how frequently the traveler travels along one or more of the road segments or passes through one or more of the intersections.

Familiarity evidence can be received from one or more sources and can have a variety of formats. For example familiarity evidence can include GPS data or a GPS trace. This GPS data can be received from a GPS unit a navigation device of a vehicle a telematics component a mobile device equipped with GPS functionality such as a cell phone etc. for example. In one or more embodiments the GPS data or GPS trace can be compiled or consolidated from multiple sources. For example a GPS trace could include GPS data from a navigation device of a vehicle driven by a traveler. Further the GPS trace could include GPS data from a mobile device or cell phone of the traveler. In other words a vehicle of the traveler could be configured to record GPS data and a mobile device could also record GPS data thereby providing enhanced familiarity coverage or familiarity evidence e.g. rather than merely relying on an on board or in vehicle GPS unit .

In one or more embodiments the familiarity evidence can be used to build an evidence model. The evidence model can represent one or more trips taken by a traveler. For example a trip can include travel along one or more road segments or through one or more intersections. This means that familiarity evidence GPS data a GPS trace a GPS reading etc. can be associated or mapped to a road segment or an intersection. In one or more embodiments this can be done using a hidden Markov model HMM . A trip can be determined in a variety of mechanisms. For example a trip may be determined when a vehicle shuts off. As another example an excursion may be counted as a trip when the vehicle remains stationary longer than a threshold period of time such as five minutes.

Additionally the evidence model can include one or more familiarity scores for one or more of the trips or one or more familiarity scores for one or more road segments from a trip a GPS trace or the familiarity evidence. In other words the familiarity evidence can be segmented into one or more trips and scored accordingly. This enables an assessment e.g. a familiarity score to be made on a road segment to determine how familiar a traveler is with that road segment based on a travel history of a traveler.

One or more familiarity scores can be determined for a trip or a road segment which was part of a trip. In one or more embodiments a score component can be configured to assign one or more familiarity scores to one or more road segments or one or more intersections based on GPS data or the familiarity evidence. In this way familiarity evidence GPS data or a GPS trace can be transformed into an evidence model which includes one or more familiarity scores. These familiarity scores can be used as a baseline for building one or more familiarity models. In other words the evidence model may be used for baseline scoring when calculating one or more of the familiarity models. In one or more embodiments the familiarity evidence can include one or more familiarity scores for one or more of the road segments or one or more of the intersections.

At one or more familiarity models can be generated. One or more of the familiarity models can be generated based on the familiarity evidence or an associated evidence model. A familiarity model component can be configured to generate one or more familiarity models based on familiarity evidence or an associated evidence model. A familiarity model can be a model for predicting or estimating a familiarity a traveler may have with one or more road segments or one or more intersections from an area e.g. which may correspond to a map . In other words a familiarity model may be based on a history or log of locations where a traveler has traveled such as a GPS trace. That is GPS data or a GPS trace can be used in conjunction with one or more algorithms to create the familiarity model by adjusting one or more parameters associated with the familiarity model according to one or more utility metrics. When one or more of these parameters are calculated waypoints along a route may be provided to the model to determine one or more familiarity scores for the route or portions of the route. Additionally the familiarity model may be indicative of a predicted familiarity of areas road segments intersections etc. near portions of the GPS trace. For example if a traveler travels along Main Street on a frequent basis and also travels along First Avenue frequently a familiarity model may determine that the traveler is familiar with the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue even when a GPS trace does not indicate that the traveler has been to that intersection.

A familiarity model can be used to represent familiarity with varying degrees of granularity. For example a familiarity score or predicted familiarity score can be assigned to a location a landmark such as a restaurant an area a road a road segment a city a neighborhood a route etc. In other words familiarity scores or predicted familiarity scores can be associated or assigned to zero dimensional objects e.g. such as a location a restaurant a landmark etc. one dimensional objects e.g. such as a road segment highway street boulevard route etc. or two dimensional objects e.g. such as an area township city etc. on a map for example. As such if a technique such as assigning a predicted familiarity score is described with reference to a route a portion of a route one or more road segments along a route etc. the technique may be applied in other embodiments to assign a predicted familiarity score to a location or an area for example. Similarly a technique described with reference to a road segment may be performed with an intersection or vice versa.

In one or more embodiments one or more of the familiarity models includes one or more predicted familiarity scores for one or more road segments or one or more intersections. That is a familiarity model can be a predictive model that may be indicative of how familiar a traveler may be with one or more road segments or one or more intersections of an area or a corresponding map of the area for example. These familiarity models road segments intersections etc. may correspond to real life locations or routes or locations on a map for example.

Familiarity models can be based on distances graph distances kernels e.g. Gaussian kernels probabilistic models probabilistic graph models road network graphs RNGs Markov random fields MRFs conditional random fields CRFs etc. In this way one or more familiarity models can be generated. For example a map kernel familiarity model a graph distance familiarity model a MRF familiarity model or one or more additional familiarity models can be generated based on familiarity evidence or an associated evidence model. The map kernel familiarity model the graph distance familiarity model or the Markov random field MRF familiarity model can include one or more predicted familiarity scores for one or more of road segments or one or more of intersections.

For example a road network graph RNG can be used to create a familiarity model. A RNG can be a graph or representation e.g. mathematical etc. of a road network which includes one or more nodes and one or more edges. One or more of the nodes or vertices of the RNG can represent one or more intersections while one or more of the edges of the RNG can represent one or more road segments. Effectively a RNG can be an ordered pair including a set vertices or nodes associated with a set of edges or lines. These edges or lines can be connected between two vertices to form the RNG.

One or more aspects of a RNG can be used to determine familiarity. For example analyzing the familiarity evidence enables one to determine where a traveler has been. In other words familiarity evidence can be indicative of whether or not a traveler has visited a road segment and how often frequently or recently the traveler traveled along the road segment. In one or more embodiments a predicted familiarity score can be determined for one or more familiarity models. For example if a GPS trace or familiarity evidence indicates that a traveler has traveled along a first road segment but not along a second road segment a predicted familiarity score can be determined based on a distance between the first road segment and the second road segment.

As used herein distance can include a distance measured by driving distance number of nodes from edge to another edge number of edges from one node to another node driving time travel time number of intersections number of qualified intersections e.g. non trivial intersections major intersections intersections associated with a traffic pattern threshold number of lanes etc. . For example a predicted familiarity score can be determined based on a number of nodes or intersections between a first road segment or first road and a second road segment or second road. As another example a predicted familiarity score can be determined based on a number of intersections where one or more roads of the intersection have four or more lanes.

In one or more embodiments one or more familiarity models or predicted familiarity scores of a familiarity model can be generated based on familiarity evidence GPS data e.g. from a mobile device navigation unit of a vehicle etc. a GPS trace etc. associated with a traveler. In other words familiarity can be modeled based on GPS data of a traveler. In one or more embodiments a familiarity model component can be configured to generate one or more familiarity models for a map or area based on familiarity evidence. In this way one or more familiarity models for the map or area can be generated.

Additionally one or more of the familiarity models of an area or predicted familiarity scores for corresponding road segments or intersections can be generated based on one or more characteristics of a road or road segment. A traveler s familiarity with a road segment or an intersection can be related to a variety of factors. As an example the relationship between familiarities for orthogonal road segments may differ from the familiarity for a continuous road segment or for segments where an angle between two road segments is not substantially orthogonal. In other words if Main Street zigzags passes through a traffic circle etc. familiarity scores may be determined or estimated more conservatively or using a different basis because a traveler may be more likely to be confused when following a road that is not continuous or linear for example.

In another example intersections can be binned or categorized based on an angle between road segments of the intersection. Further a predicted familiarity score or familiarity model including such an intersection could be based on the binning or categorization of the intersection. For example an intersection could fall into one of three categories where the angle between road segments may be less than 60 between 60 and 120 or between 120 and 180 . A familiarity score for this intersection or one of the road segments of the intersection could be based on the angle between the road segments or the corresponding categorization.

In one or more embodiments a familiarity model and one or more corresponding predicted familiarity scores or an evidence model and one or more familiarity scores can be generated based on one or more of these road characteristics. For example a familiarity model can be based on a proximity of a road segment or an intersection to another road segment or another intersection administrative boundaries e.g. same county same road same block same neighborhood etc. a shape or curvature of a road or road segment a road name traffic patterns speed limits number of lanes traffic level a type of road e.g. highway drive avenue boulevard local state federal designation number of roads or ways intersecting at an intersection or junction number of businesses along a road or road segment etc.

Further a familiarity model or an evidence model can be generated based on other factors related to a traveler or a vehicle. For example a familiarity model can update familiarity scores or predicted familiarity scores based on a trend in GPS data or new GPS data collected from the traveler. Conversely the familiarity model can be updated or generated based on one or more temporal aspects related to the GPS data. In other words as a portion of a GPS trace gets older or more time passes the corresponding familiarity model or predicted familiarity scores for that portion of the GPS trace may be adjusted accordingly. For example if a traveler has a routine route to work but switches from a first job to a second job and doesn t revisit the old routine route to the first job familiarity with the route to the first job may decline over a period of time. That is the traveler may not be as familiar with the route to the first job as time passes and new businesses are constructed along the route etc.

In one or more embodiments familiarity models or evidence models can be based on a frequency a traveler visits a location such as an intersection. The frequency can be indicative of how often the traveler travels along a route or one or more road segments associated with the route. Additionally familiarity models can be tailored to a profile of a traveler. For example age and gender can be used to adjust a familiarity model among other factors. That is a younger traveler or driver may be less familiar with an area than a middle aged driver who has more experience. However an elderly driver may be less familiar with the area than the middle aged driver due to a decline in memory for example.

A familiarity model or corresponding familiarity scores can be based on a current time. For example if familiarity evidence indicates that a driver travels on a road segment frequently an evidence model built from the familiarity evidence can assign that road segment a high familiarity score. Further the familiarity evidence may include timestamps indicative of a time of day or day of the week that the driver traveled on the road segment. As an example the familiarity evidence may indicate that the driver drove on the road segment between 11 00 AM and 1 00 PM. These time stamps associated with the familiarity evidence or evidence model can be used to modify one or more of the familiarity scores. That is a familiarity model or corresponding familiarity scores can fluctuate based on a time of day day of the week sunrise sunset amount of light out visibility based on weather conditions etc. In other words a familiarity model may indicate that a driver is more familiar with a road segment during times corresponding to the familiarity evidence or evidence model for that road segment. For example if a driver consistently takes a highway at night a familiarity model generated based on that familiarity evidence may favor familiarity at night.

Traveler familiarity with one or more alternative routes a number of shortcuts taken by the traveler historical route choices etc. can also be used to build a familiarity model. For example in a scenario where a driver is observed taking an alternate route when a typical or direct route has a high traffic pattern or the driver takes the alternate route at rush hour one or more road segments corresponding neighborhoods etc. can be assigned a higher predicted familiarity score than a second driver who uses the direct route on a more regular basis.

In one or more embodiments a familiarity model can include baseline familiarity data similar to familiarity evidence or a corresponding evidence model. That is an area intersection or road segment where a traveler has traveled may be scored as familiar while areas intersection or road segments where the traveler has not traveled may be scored as less familiar. Further familiarity may be a function of travel frequency. In other words the more frequent or recent a traveler has traveled on a roadway or road segment the higher the familiarity the traveler may have and a predicted familiarity score can be assigned accordingly.

According to one or more aspects graph based familiarity models can be used. As mentioned a road network graph RNG can be generated where one or more nodes of the RNG represent one or more intersections and one or more edges of the RNG represent one or more road segments. Elements of the RNG such as nodes or edges can be associated with one or more attributes and a graph based familiarity model can be based on these aspects accordingly. For example an edge connecting a first node and a second node can be associated with a distance speed limits topological data etc. The distance can be indicative of a driving distance between the first node and the second node or a driving time between the first node and the second node. Further one or more familiarity scores for the familiarity model can be determined based on this information.

As an example if the driver is mildly familiar with the first node e.g. intersection and the second node is a long distance away the second node may be assigned a low predicted familiarity score. Conversely if the second node is a short distance from the first node the edge and the second node may be assigned a similar predicted familiarity score as the first node. In other words familiarity can be predictively scored based on distance from a nearest node or nearest edge of a GPS trace where a traveler has traveled. That is familiarity can be inversely proportional to the distance from a nearest point on a GPS trace where a traveler has traveled. Distance can be measured in number of node number of edges number of intersections based on qualifications driving time meters feet etc. Additionally familiarity may be proportional to a number of visits to that nearest point.

In one or more embodiments a familiarity model may be based on map kernels distance familiarity evidence frequency of visits etc. As an example a map kernel can be an abstract object on a map that is indicative of evidence of familiarity over a group of locations. These kernels can be derived from map data or other designations such as a municipality boundary etc. A predicted familiarity score may taper relative to a map kernel as distance increases from the map kernel. The tapering can be controlled or tuned based on training data feedback a survey profiling of travelers etc.

As an example an intersection of a first road and a second road that is located in a downtown area of a city can include an intersection kernel a first road kernel a second road kernel a downtown kernel a city kernel etc. When familiarity evidence indicates that a traveler has visited this intersection a familiarity level familiarity score etc. for these corresponding kernels may be increased and familiarity for surrounding areas can be determined based on familiarity scores associated with the kernels and a distance of a surrounding area from one or more of the kernels. In one or more embodiments familiarity can be calculated as a sum of evidence from the respective kernels.

In one or more embodiments a familiarity model can be based on a Markov random field MRF associated with a road network or map. A MRF based familiarity model is a model that can represent a joint probability distribution over graph structured data or random variables. That is a MRF familiarity model can be used to represent correlations between variables connected by a network. Here a MRF familiarity model can be used to predict a familiarity level a traveler has with an area of a map. In other words familiarity information can be propagated from familiarity evidence or GPS data to a map or corresponding database for example. A MRF familiarity model can be based on a road network graph RNG according to one or more embodiments. Accordingly a RNG can be generated where the RNG includes one or more RNG nodes corresponding to one or more intersections of a map and one or more RNG edges corresponding to one or more road segments of the map. Elements of a RNG such as nodes or edges can be associated with coordinates latitudes longitudes distances speed limits random variables over a domain etc.

The MRF familiarity model can be based on the RNG such that one or more potential functions are defined over elements of a clique. A clique can be a set of nodes such that there is an edge between every two pairs of nodes e.g. such as a triangle . A clique of a MRF can correspond to an intersection or a node in the RNG. In this way familiarity can be correlated for road segments of a road network which meet at an intersection. In one or more embodiments a familiarity model component can be configured to generate one or more of the potential functions over one or more MRF nodes of a clique or one or more MRF edges of a clique. In other words one or more potential functions can be generated for one or more cliques associated with the MRF familiarity model. Potential functions can be generated for a variety of RNG elements or aspects such as intersections roads neighborhoods or other map objects for example.

According to one or more aspects when nodes of a clique are assigned differing familiarity scores or familiarity random variables the MRF familiarity model can associate the respective familiarity scores thereby pulling them closer together. In this scenario the familiarity model component can be configured to adjust one or more of the familiarity models based on one or more of the potential functions. For example the familiarity model component can be configured to adjust assignments to one or more road segments sharing a common intersection where the road segments have a difference in familiarity scores greater than a threshold.

In one or more embodiments a MRF graph can be generated based on a RNG. As mentioned a RNG can include one or more RNG nodes and one or more RNG edges where the RNG nodes can represent intersections and the RNG edges can represent road segments. Similarly a MRF graph can include one or more MRF nodes and one or more MRF edges connecting one or more of the MRF nodes. Here a MRF graph can be derived from the RNG graph. For example one or more of the MRF nodes can correspond to one or more of the RNG edges of the RNG and one or more MRF edges can be formed between two RNG edges of the road network graph sharing a common RNG node. Stated another way a MRF graph can a line graph where RNG edges of the RNG are MRF nodes and MRF edges are formed for the MRF graph between two nodes of the MRF graph when corresponding RNG edges are adjacent such that they share a common RNG node. In this way a MRF graph can be generated by connecting RNG edges incident at a same RNG intersection.

According to one or more aspects one or more additional nodes can be created for a MRF graph or a RNG. For example one or more road name nodes can be created where a road name node is a node that represents a road name. The familiarity model component can be configured to create one or more of the road name nodes for a MRF graph. In one or more embodiments nodes sharing the same road name can be connected to the road name node. Further the familiarity model component can be configured to define one or more potential functions for a clique including one or more road name nodes to express a correlation or relationship between one or more route segment which share the same road name. In this way an additional node can correspond to a clique in a line graph as will be described in e.g. neighborhood node N . In one or more embodiments one or more observation nodes can be created where an observation node can be indicative of a number of times a clique or a node was visited by a traveler. In one or more embodiments a familiarity model can be weighted based on one or more factors such as independent parameters etc.

In one or more embodiments a weighted ensemble familiarity model can be generated based on one or more familiarity models. The weighted ensemble familiarity model can include a graph based familiarity model a map kernel familiarity model a Markov random field MRF familiarity model etc. The weighted ensemble familiarity model can be a weighted linear combination of one or more of the respective familiarity models. As an example a model including the MRF familiarity model and the map kernel familiarity model can be weighted at 0.6 and 0.4 respectively. Here this means that the MRF familiarity model can be used for 60 of the weight for familiarity modeling and the map kernel familiarity model can be used for 40 of the weight. Weights for a linear combination can be tuned using training data to a traveler etc.

One or more familiarity models can be used to facilitate navigation. When turn by turn directions are provided for a route one or more directions for the route can be based on a familiarity model such as a map kernel familiarity model a graph distance familiarity model or a MRF familiarity model. For example when a predicted familiarity score for a familiarity model indicates that a traveler is substantially familiar with an area or a road segment along a route directions for the area or road segment may be omitted from navigation combined with other navigation directions or phrased in a different manner.

At an origin location and a destination location can be received. The origin location can be a location determined from a GPS unit or navigation unit such as a telematics component of a vehicle. The destination location may be received from a traveler via an input component of the vehicle or the telematics component. For example a telematics component can be configured to determine a current location for a vehicle. The method can include generating a route from the origin location to the destination location at . In one or more embodiments the route from the origin location to the destination location can be received such as from a third party server for example. A route can include one or more route segments corresponding to one or more road segments of a map. That is a road segment can be a portion of a route. In other words one or more of the route segments can correspond to one or more of the road segments along the route. Additionally the route may include one or more sets of directions for one or more of the route segments.

In one or more embodiments a familiarity model can be used to calculate a predicted familiarity score for a route one or more route segments of the route or one or more corresponding road segments. As an example predicted familiarity scores for road segments or route segments along a route can be averaged to determine a predicted familiarity score for the route.

At directions for the route can be provided based on a map kernel familiarity model a graph based familiarity model such as a graph distance familiarity model a MRF familiarity model or other familiarity models. One or more landmarks along the route can be identified. For example familiarity evidence or a corresponding evidence model can be used to determine a familiarity level a traveler has with a landmark or a location nearby. These landmarks can be incorporated into one or more of the directions for the route. For example a direction may tell a driver Turn right at the red barn when the evidence model or familiarity evidence indicates that the driver is substantially familiar with the red barn or a location associated with the red barn.

In one or more embodiments providing directions for the route can include generating a sub route based on one or more familiarity models. A sub route can include one or more of the directions mapped to a macro state. In other words driving directions of the route can be adapted to be more succinct understandable or personalized by omitting combining or rewording directions using a familiarity model. In this way directions can be provided based on a familiarity level or familiarity model that a traveler has with a portion of a route such as a road segment. What this means is that one or more portions of a route or corresponding directions can be presented to a traveler at a high level or with high level directions.

High level directions can be based on natural language trained from humans etc. For example when a traveler is unfamiliar with an area turn by turn directions can include Turn right at Main Street turn left at First Avenue turn left on 71 North . When the traveler is familiar with the area directions for that portion of the route may include Take 71 North using Main Street . Here an order of directions can be reversed or adjusted when a traveler may be familiar with an area as indicated by a familiarity model. That is in the unfamiliar scenario the traveler is presented with Turn right at Main Street prior to turn left on 71 North while in the familiar scenario the traveler is presented with 71 North before Main Street.

In one or more embodiments one or more of the familiarity models or directions for a route can be tuned. For example after a set of high level directions are provided such as at behavior of a traveler or driver can be observed. If the driver appears to hesitate fails to follow one or more of the high level directions according to an anticipated reaction an associated threshold for one or more of the familiarity models can be adjusted. In this way observed driving behavior can be incorporated in to one or more of the familiarity models or a system or component associated with generating one or more of the directions navigation instructions etc. thereby facilitating tuning .

Combination of macro states and generation of high level directions can be probabilistically by a conditional random field CRF and can depend on features other than familiarity such as timing and fluency of generation saliency of landmarks road network topology etc. A cognition component can be configured to provide one or more directions from an origin location to a destination location along a route based on the route and one or more familiarity models. Further the cognition component can be configured to combine adjust reword or omit directions according to predicted familiarity scores or associated familiarity models. In this way familiarity modeling can clarify navigation enhance GPS efficiency mitigate interruptions etc. among other things.

The telematics component can be configured to gather GPS data or a GPS trace and transform the GPS trace into a set of familiarity evidence associated with a traveler. Additionally the interface component can be configured to receive additional GPS data from additional sources such as a mobile device social networks etc. The telematics component can collect the GPS data over a period of time such as three months. The score component can be configured to assign or determine one or more familiarity scores for one or more road segments or intersections based on the familiarity evidence. The collection component can be configured to receive familiarity evidence which can include one or more familiarity scores for one or more road segments where the traveler has driven or traveled.

The familiarity model component can be configured to generate one or more familiarity models for a map based on familiarity evidence or an evidence model. One or more of the familiarity models can be based on one or more kernels one or more graph distances or one or more Markov random fields MRFs . The score component can be configured to assign or determine one or more predicted familiarity scores for one or more road segments or intersections based on one or more of the familiarity models. The familiarity model can comprise one or more of the predicted familiarity scores for one or more road segments one or more of the intersections or one or more other features of a map.

The telematics component can be configured to receive an origin location and a destination location and generate or receive a route from the origin location to the destination location. The route can be along one or more road segments and include one or more corresponding route segments. In one or more embodiments the cognition component can be configured to provide one or more directions from the origin location to the destination location based on the route and one or more of the familiarity models. As an example the cognition component can be configured to restrict or omit directions along a portion of a route. That is if a roadway is long such as Interstate 77 directions may be provided for unfamiliar portions and not for familiar portions of I 77.

The cognition component can be configured to provide broad directions for familiar areas such as Head towards Michael s house where Michael may be a relative acquaintance or a contact in a linked or associated address book. In this way one or more contacts can be incorporated into directions for a route. When a familiarity model indicates an area is a predicted familiar area multiple directions may be given in series or in advance rather than on a turn by turn basis for example. In one or more embodiments the cognition component can instruct a driver to head towards a familiar landmark and create a deviation accordingly prior to reaching the landmark.

According to one or more aspects the cognition component can be configured to mitigate interruptions by providing instructions in familiar areas when no conversation or infotainment is detected. That is a detection component not shown can be configured to detect conversation such as based on a noise level etc. When the telematics component receives a current location of a vehicle e.g. GPS coordinates or GPS data the current location of the vehicle can be cross referenced with a corresponding location or road segment in one or more familiarity models. If a familiarity model indicates that the traveler or driver is generally familiar with the area the cognition component may omit combine reword adjust etc. directions associated with road segments in the area when conversation is detected for example. In this way interruptions can be mitigated.

In one or more embodiments the cognition component may omit directions when a traveler is traveling in a direction similar to a direction provided by the route. As an example when a driver stops to fuel up at a gas station the cognition component can be configured to mitigate re routing for the telematics component . Similarly when the telematics component indicates that a driver is in a familiar area GPS usage can be mitigated. In other words GPS data can be collected at a longer or larger interval in familiar areas thereby mitigating power consumption. In other embodiments routes may be selected based on familiarity. Often multiple routes between an origin location and a destination location are available so the cognition component may select a route based on a driver or traveler s familiarity with the route as a whole such as based on an average of predicted familiarity scores or familiarity scores along road segments of the route.

The interface component can be configured to prompt a traveler for feedback related to directions for a road segment and adjust the predicted familiarity score for a corresponding familiarity model accordingly. For example feedback may be received that can be indicative of a traveler s perception of his or her own familiarity score with a road segment city area location etc. In other words a traveler reported familiarity score can be received reported and compared to a corresponding predicted familiarity score in a familiarity model. The reported familiarity score may replace the predicted familiarity score and the familiarity model may be adjusted accordingly. Feedback can include attributes or characteristics related to a traveler such as age gender make and model of a vehicle driving habits etc. Different familiarity models for different drivers can be stored or profiled to characterize one or more trends among travelers.

A familiarity model can be used to impact a fuel gauge or energy meter a display etc. to mitigate range anxiety. For example a traveler may generally be more comfortable on a full tank of gas fully charged battery fuel source etc. when traveling in an unfamiliar area. The familiarity model component can be configured to promote a traveler to recharge or refuel by exaggerating or adjusting a fuel level or energy level based on familiarity. For example when a traveler is en route from a familiar area to an unfamiliar area prior to reaching an unfamiliar road segment the interface component can be configured to have a fuel gauge or energy meter display a lower than actual reading thereby encouraging a driver to recharge or refuel the vehicle prior to driving in the unfamiliar area. In this way a display buffer can be created to mitigate range anxiety for a traveler in an unfamiliar area.

In one or more embodiments a MRF graph can be constructed by connecting edges of the RNG that are incident at the same intersection. In other words edges of the RNG made up of nodes A B C D E F and corresponding edges can form one or more of the nodes of the MRF graph such as nodes and . Further these nodes for the MRF graph can be connected when the corresponding edges of the RNG share a common node. For example edge of the RNG e.g. node of the MRF graph can be connected to edge e.g. node of the MRF graph of the RNG via MRF edge because road ED shares node D with road DB. also illustrates one or more potential functions for the MRF graph such as a potential function for intersection A and a potential function for neighborhood N.

An artificial intelligence AI component can be provided that employs probabilistic or statistical based analysis to infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. As used herein the term infer or inference generally refers to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of a system environment or user from observations as captured via events or data. Inference can be employed to identify a context or action or to generate a probability distribution over states for example. In one or more embodiments the inference can be probabilistic. In other words computation of a probability distribution over states of interest can be based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher level events from a set of events or data.

Such classification can employ a probabilistic or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. Further attributes can be derived and classes can be categories or areas of interest.

A support vector machine SVM is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs where the hypersurface splits triggering criteria from non triggering events. This facilitates classification for testing data that is similar but not necessarily identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include na ve Bayes Bayesian networks decision trees neural networks fuzzy logic models probabilistic classification models etc. These models can provide different patterns of independence when employed. Classification can include statistical regression utilized to develop models of priority or ranking.

One or more embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained e.g. via a generic training data or implicitly trained e.g. via observing user behavior receiving extrinsic information etc. . For example SVM s can be configured via a learning phase or a training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus the classifier can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions.
