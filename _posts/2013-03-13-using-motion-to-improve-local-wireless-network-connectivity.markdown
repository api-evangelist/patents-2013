The present application for patent is related to the following co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 800 699 entitled USING MOTION TO OPTIMIZE PLACE OF RELEVANCE OPERATIONS by Lee and Teague filed concurrently herewith assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Mobile devices such as cell phones smart phones tablet computers laptops personal digital assistants PDAs etc. are often capable of connecting to local wireless networks such as wireless local area networks WLANs WiFi networks Bluetooth networks etc. Such networks are often used to provide data connectivity for mobile devices. However maintaining a connection while a mobile device is moving from one geographic area to another can be challenging.

Currently mobile devices simply perform periodic scans when not connected and suppress all scans when connected. When connected scans are suppressed to save energy but this can hinder the ability of the device to efficiently find and switch to a better access point e.g. one with a higher signal to noise ratio . When not connected the rate of scanning is a tradeoff between power consumption and the delay of establishing a connection. This is especially an issue with moving devices where the best access point may be changing relatively quickly. These scans can require significant power and thus there is an opportunity to use motion information to improve the power performance of the connectivity management.

The disclosure is directed to using motion to improve local wireless network connectivity. A method of using motion to improve local wireless network connectivity includes determining whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed and if the motion state has changed determining whether or not to trigger a scan for a local wireless network.

An apparatus for using motion to improve local wireless network connectivity includes logic configured to determine whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed and logic configured to determine whether or not to trigger a scan for a local wireless network if the motion state has changed.

An apparatus for using motion to improve local wireless network connectivity includes means for determining whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed and means for determining whether or not to trigger a scan for a local wireless network if the motion state has changed.

A non transitory computer readable medium for using motion to improve local wireless network connectivity includes at least one instruction to determine whether or not a motion state of a mobile device has changed and at least one instruction to determine whether or not to trigger a scan for a local wireless network if the motion state has changed.

Various aspects are disclosed in the following description and related drawings. Alternate aspects may be devised without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally well known elements of the disclosure will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the disclosure.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any aspect described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects. Likewise the term aspects of the disclosure does not require that all aspects of the disclosure include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many aspects are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally the sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the aspects described herein the corresponding form of any such aspects may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks WiFi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Evolution Data Optimized EV DO Evolved High Rate Packet Data eHRPD Global System of Mobile Communication GSM Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE Wideband CDMA W CDMA Long Term Evolution LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs eNode Bs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of WiFi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE or UE over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. for a WiFi router with both wired and wireless connectivity .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet .

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only memory ROM or random access memory RAM electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like.

Accordingly an aspect of the disclosure can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the aspects of the disclosure and are merely to aid in the description of various aspects of the disclosure.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE A or B the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G CDMA W CDMA 3G 4G LTE etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. the application the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM flash memory ROM erasable programmable ROM EPROM EEPROM registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input .

The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an aspect that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the aspects described below in more detail.

Mobile UEs such as cell phones smart phones tablet computers laptops PDAs etc. are often capable of connecting to local wireless networks such as WLANs WiFi networks Bluetooth networks etc. Such networks are often used to provide data connectivity for mobile devices. However maintaining a connection while a UE is moving from one geographic area to another can be challenging.

Currently UEs simply perform periodic scans when not connected and suppress all scans when connected. When connected scans are suppressed to save energy but this can hinder the ability of the UE to efficiently find and switch to a better access point e.g. one with a higher signal to noise ratio SNR . When not connected the rate of scanning is a tradeoff between power consumption and the delay of establishing a connection. This is especially an issue with moving UEs where the best access point may be changing relatively quickly. For example a UE may scan for local wireless networks while the user is driving even though the UE will not be able to connect to a wireless network before the UE is out of range of that network. In another example the UE may be stationary and not connected in which case scanning for available wireless networks is unnecessary at least after an initial scan.

As shown frequent scans can require significant power. However when the UE is moving or is stationary but not connected there is a reduced need to perform frequent scans. Thus the motion state of the UE can be used to improve the power performance of the connectivity management. For instance the motion state of the UE can be used to avoid unnecessary scans for available local wireless networks. The motion state classifier requires very little power and thus is always on.

First if the UE is not connected and stationary then scans are suppressed or slowed. The reason is that if the UE is not moving then the access point signal strengths are unlikely to change significantly. Further if a distance bound can be computed from the motion information scans may be triggered only if the distance travelled exceeds a set threshold. This threshold can be set to optimize performance and can be related to the coverage distance of the wireless network signals.

Second if the UE is not connected and moving quickly e.g. faster than a threshold then scans are suppressed or slowed. The reason is that since access points have limited range if the UE is moving quickly enough the UE is likely to be out of range before it can be detected and establish a connection or the connection would be of such short duration as to be of no use .

Third if the UE is connected and stationary then scans are not likely to be needed for connectivity purposes and are suppressed or slowed. However if motion is detected then occasional scans may help the UE maintain connection with the best available access point. Further a combination of signal strength and motion information can be used to determine the need for a scan. If the SNR for the connected access point is high scans can be suppressed regardless of motion. However if the SNR is low scans can be triggered by motion or by a distance travelled exceeding a set bound.

Certain UE states do not fall into the above three categories and should be addressed separately. For example if the UE is stationary and a new closer access point is turned on the UE will not detect the new access point if it is not performing scans. This rarely happens and can be addressed by the UE performing a long interval heartbeat scan e.g. 300 seconds when it is stationary. Another example is that the UE may be connected to a mobile hotspot while in transit. This can be addressed by treating mobile hotspots as a separate case. It can also be addressed by performing a long interval heartbeat scan e.g. 300 seconds .

To determine whether the UE is stationary or moving the motion of the UE can be classified into eight motion states walk run sit stand absolute rest fiddle in transit and null. Fiddle means the user is holding the UE. In transit means the mobile device is travelling in any vehicle such as an automobile a train a plane etc. Null means that the motion classifier cannot reach a level of confidence in the motion classification necessary to report a motion state. These motion states can be determined by the UE s accelerometer only which requires very little power.

These eight fine grained motion states can be remapped to two coarse grained motion states stationary sit stand fiddle absolute rest and non stationary walk run in transit . These coarse grained motion states cause two motion state change events the UE can go from stationary to non stationary or from non stationary to stationary.

There are several types of motion state change algorithms that can be used to determine the motion state of the UE. For example the instant change detection ICD algorithm monitors consecutive motion states and detects any transition between stationary and non stationary motion states the algorithm ignores the null output . As another example the cumulative sum control chart CUSUM based change detection CCD algorithm accumulates and detects change upon crossing a maximum divided by two e.g. the maximum may be 10 seconds . As yet another example the CUSUM based and collapse change detection CCCD algorithm detects change events within two minutes. This works because many of the CUSUM based change events are generated within two minutes. The algorithm collapses or combines change events if they are generated within two minutes.

Motion change events can be determined from a function that uses the parameters event type timestamp and metadata. The event type parameter can be a one bit binary value that indicates whether or not the motion change event is a change from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state. That is a can indicate a change from stationary to non stationary and a can indicate either no change or a change from non stationary to stationary. The timestamp parameter can be a four byte value that indicates the epoch time. The metadata parameter is optional and can indicate the current motion state and or a confidence level in the motion state change. The metadata parameter can include a three bit field to indicate the motion state three bits provides eight unique states and four bytes for the confidence level. There is no need to consider the packet header size.

Within the motion state manager a motion detector receives input from the sensor s . The motion detector passes motion data to the motion state classifier which classifies the motion as one of sitting standing fiddling absolute rest walking running or in transit. The motion state classifier passes the motion state to the motion state change detector which determines whether or not the motion state of the UE has changed from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state or from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state.

The disconnected state manager performs network scanning at . The disconnected state manager scans for available local wireless networks upon a long interval heartbeat trigger and or upon detecting that the UE has disconnected from a local wireless network. The disconnected state manager sends a request to the local wireless network detector to scan for available wireless networks and in response receives a list of access points referred to as APs in and their associated received signal strength indication RSSI from the local wireless network detector .

At the disconnected state manager determines whether or not there are any available access points. If there are not then at the disconnected state manager retrieves the current motion state of the UE from the motion state manager . At the disconnected state manager determines whether or not the UE is stationary based on the retrieved motion state. If it is then the disconnected state manager waits for the motion state to change from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state. If however the UE is non stationary then the disconnected state manager waits for the motion state to change from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state. The disconnected state manager detects a change from one motion state to another based on motion state change events received from the motion state manager . When the motion state changes the flow returns to to scan for available networks.

If at the disconnected state manager determines that there is an available access point then at the UE performs access point connection authentication. Control then passes to the connected state manager .

The connected state manager waits for trigger events at . The trigger events may occur upon a motion state change as indicated by the motion state change detector or upon an access point s RSSI rising above a threshold as indicated by the local wireless network detector . At the connected state manager determines whether or not the current motion state is a non stationary motion state. If it is not then the flow returns to .

If the UE is in a non stationary motion state however then at the connected state manager determines whether or not the RSSI of the access point is below a threshold. If it is not then the flow returns to . If the RSSI is below the threshold however then at the connected state manager scans for other available networks. The connected state manager sends a request to the local wireless network detector to scan for available networks and in response receives a list of available access points and their corresponding RSSIs.

At the connected state manager determines if there are any available access points. If there are not then control passes to the disconnected state manager . If there are however then the flow proceeds to where the UE performs access point connection authentication.

If the mobile device is moving faster than the threshold e.g. the user is driving then at the mobile device determines whether or not it is connected to a mobile hotspot. If the mobile device is not moving faster than the threshold e.g. the user is walking or running then at the mobile device determines whether or not it has moved more than a threshold distance. If the mobile device has not moved more than the threshold distance then at the mobile device determines whether the signal strength of the wireless network to which it is connected if it is connected is below a threshold. If the mobile device has moved more than the threshold distance then at the mobile device scans for available local wireless networks. The threshold distance can be the approximate diameter of the type of local wireless network to which the mobile device is connected or to which it is trying to connect. This may be a different threshold distance depending on the type of network.

If the signal strength is below the threshold then at the mobile device scans for available local wireless networks. If the signal strength is not below the threshold then at the mobile device prevents scanning for available local wireless networks.

Returning to if the mobile device is connected to a mobile hotspot then at the mobile device prevents scanning for available local wireless networks. If the mobile device is not connected to a mobile hotspot then at the mobile device performs a periodic heartbeat scan for available local wireless networks. This can be a long interval heartbeat scan such as every 300 seconds.

Returning to if the mobile device is connected to an external power source then at the mobile device prevents scanning for available local wireless networks. If the mobile device is not connected to an external power source then at the mobile device performs a periodic heartbeat scan for available local wireless networks.

At the mobile device determines the prior motion state and the current motion state. At the mobile device determines whether the motion state of the mobile device changed from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state. That is the mobile device determines whether or not the motion state changed from one of walking running or in transit to one of sitting standing fiddling or absolute rest. If the motion state has changed from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state then at the mobile device scans for an available local wireless network.

If however at the motion state did not change from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state then at the mobile device determines whether or not the motion state of the mobile device changed from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state. That is the mobile device determines whether or not the motion state changed from one of sitting standing fiddling or absolute rest to one of walking running or in transit. If the motion state has not changed from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state then the flow returns to .

If however at the motion state has changed from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state then at the mobile device determines whether or not the motion state is in transit. If the motion state is not in transit then at the mobile device scans for an available local wireless network. If however the motion state is in transit then at the mobile device prevents scanning for available local wireless networks. The flow then returned to .

When the motion state changes from a stationary motion state to a non stationary motion state and the mobile device scans for an available local wireless network the mobile device may not select the local wireless network with the strongest signal. Rather it would be preferable for the mobile device to select the available local wireless network toward which it is moving if the mobile device can identify that local wireless network. On the other hand if the motion state of the mobile device changes from a non stationary motion state to a stationary motion state and the mobile device scans for an available local wireless network the mobile device should preferably select the available local wireless network with the strongest signal.

Motion state change events enable low power communication between the wireless local network subsystem and the sensor subsystem. Additionally motion state change events occur infrequently which further reduces power consumption.
