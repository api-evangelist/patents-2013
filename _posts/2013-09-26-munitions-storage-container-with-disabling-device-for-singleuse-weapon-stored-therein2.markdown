title: Munitions storage container with disabling device for single-use weapon stored therein
abstract: A munitions disabling device is disposed in a storage container proximate the muzzle of a single-use weapon. A projectile having a fused warhead is loaded in the weapon prior to storing the weapon. If an unplanned stimulus launches the projectile while the weapon is in the storage container, the projectile will impact or strike the disabling device. The disabling device prevents detonation or explosion of the warhead.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to compliance with Insensitive Munitions IM standards.

IM standards require that to the extent practicable munitions are safe when subjected to unplanned stimuli. Shoulder launched single use weapons are problematic because the weapon is packaged and stored with the projectile and warhead already loaded in the weapon. When exposed to unplanned external stimuli single use shoulder launched munitions may fail IM requirements. For example an unplanned stimulus may ignite the propellant in the single use shoulder launched weapon thereby launching the projectile and activating the arming sequence of the warhead. If the warhead arms it may detonate on impact IM Type I detonation reaction . An IM Type V burning reaction is required to pass most IM requirements but can be very difficult to achieve. Thus an improvement from a Type I detonation to a Type IV deflagration reaction is desirable if it may be easily achieved.

Known munition cans or containers have several forms including boxes and tubes. Some of these cans have IM features that 1 provide for the venting of gases 2 provide ballistic protection or 3 provide insulation to delay the reaction time so other IM features may be utilized. Ballistic protection against fragment impact is often costly in terms of both packaging cost and logistical cost weight volume . Venting and insulation alone are often not sufficient and additional IM features must be built into the weapon. The additional IM features may not be feasible due to cost and technical difficulty. While there are known methods to contain exploding ammunition none of the known methods can contain a projectile with an exploding warhead after it is launched from a weapon.

A need exists for an apparatus and method for achieving at least a Type IV deflagration reaction when a projectile is launched from a weapon by unplanned stimuli. The solution must be relatively low in cost and have minimal logistical impact.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus including a single use weapon having a barrel a muzzle and a projectile with a fused warhead loaded in the weapon. The barrel defines a bore with a central longitudinal axis and a bore cross sectional area. The apparatus includes a storage container of a size for storing no more than one of the single use weapon. The storage container has a central longitudinal axis. The single use weapon is disposed in the storage container with the central longitudinal axis of the bore of the weapon generally parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the storage container.

The storage container includes first and second closed ends joined by a closed body. A projectile disabling device is disposed inside the storage container proximate the first closed end and proximate the muzzle of the weapon such that the projectile strikes the disabling device when the projectile is launched from the weapon.

In one embodiment the disabling device is a metal plate having a planar surface that is angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the bore and that faces the muzzle. In another embodiment the disabling device is a curved pipe with a bore. The disabling device may also be a metal plate positioned parallel to the bore axis of the weapon such that the metal plate intersects a projection of the bore cross sectional area along the bore axis. In a further embodiment the disabling device is a metal spike positioned generally parallel to the bore axis and transversely offset from the bore axis.

The disabling device may be a pivoting frame. The pivoting frame includes a pair of parallel sides spaced apart a width greater than a width of the projectile a striking panel that connects the pair of sides at one end of the pivoting frame and a rear panel that connects the pair of sides at the other end of the pivoting frame.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of disabling a projectile launched from a single use weapon. The projectile includes a fused warhead. The method includes launching the projectile from the single use weapon while the single use weapon is in a storage container. Then the fused warhead is disabled using a disabling device disposed in the storage container proximate a muzzle of the single use weapon. Disabling the warhead may produce a Type IV Insensitive Munitions reaction.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Projectile includes a warhead containing an explosive composition . A fuze is used to ignite or detonate explosive composition . Explosive composition may fill only a portion of the interior of projectile or substantially all of the interior of projectile . Warhead may be for example in the form of a shaped charge with a liner and a void or empty space forward of liner . Fuse may be located behind explosive composition . In some embodiments of projectile fuse may be located at the nose of projectile or at some other location. Projectile may include a fin assembly enclosed in a rear portion of the external casing of projectile . Fuse will not arm warhead until sufficient time has elapsed for projectile to travel a safe distance from weapon and the weapon user. Prior to arming warhead it is possible to disable warhead and or fuse .

Weapon is stored in a storage container shown schematically in . Projectile with warhead is loaded in weapon prior to storage in container . Container stores only a single weapon and is sized for only a single weapon . Container has a central longitudinal axis B. Weapon is disposed in container with bore axis A of weapon generally parallel to axis B of container . Storage container includes first and second closed ends joined by a closed body . Container may be made of for example metal or wood. If wood is used metal framing for container may be required. The metal frame may be required to enable container to maintain enough structural integrity during the fast cook off test. Container with loaded weapon disposed therein is stored in a horizontal position that is bore axis A and container axis B are horizontal in the stored position. Multiple containers with respective loaded weapons therein may be stacked or palletized with axes A and B horizontal.

If an unplanned stimulus ignites the propellant not shown in the Figures in weapon projectile may be launched from weapon even though weapon is stored in container . The kinetic energy of the launched projectile may be used to disable warhead and or fuse . A disabling device may be stored in container in front of muzzle of weapon . When an unplanned launch of projectile occurs projectile will impact or strike disabling device in container . Disabling device may be embodied in several forms.

Disabling device may be a mass that damages projectile or any of its components for example fuse and or warhead . The mass may simply cause damage by impact with projectile thereby damaging fuse and or warhead . The mass may deflect or bend projectile thereby deflecting bending shearing or otherwise damaging fuze or warhead . The mass may cut apart projectile thereby damaging fuse or warhead . The mass may puncture projectile thereby damaging fuse and or warhead . The disabling device may in addition to other methods use the force of impact to move pivot or bend projectile in a manner to damage fuse located behind warhead or to damage warhead or to damage another fuse located behind a precursor warhead.

Plate may be made of metal for example low carbon steel. Plate includes a planar surface that forms an angle C with respect to axis A of bore and that faces muzzle . Angle C may be for example in the range of 15 to 75 degrees and preferably in the range of 40 to 50 degrees. Plate may have a thickness E in the range of about inch to about 1.5 inches. The area of planar surface is at least as large as the area H of the projection of the cross sectional area of bore onto a plane parallel to planar surface .

As shown in which is a view from above container container and weapon are horizontal and plate is preferably vertical. The preferred storage position is with container and weapon horizontal and with plate vertical. In this position components of deflected projectile will travel in the general direction of arrow F and the deflected plate will travel in the general direction of arrow G. Lateral deflection of projectile and plate is preferred rather than upward deflection of either projectile or plate .

Plate must be positioned in container securely enough to prevent movement of plate during routine shipping and handling of container . Of course plate will move after impact with projectile . Various methods may be used to position plate in container . In one method foam inserts may be disposed around plate to maintain its position. If container or a portion of container is made of metal another method of preventing unwanted movement of plate is spot welding plate at a few points to container or its metal frame. There are numerous other methods to secure plate in container to prevent movement during routine shipping and handling.

Computer modeling and simulation tests were performed for a high energy projectile fired from an M136 AT4 recoilless rifle and striking a one half inch metal plate at forty five degrees. The simulation showed that the yield strength in the fuse and booster regions of projectile was exceeded.

Actual tests were performed with a high energy projectile striking low carbon steel plates with widths of and one inch respectively. When using either the one inch thick plate or the inch thick plate 1 fuse separated from warhead 2 the nose cone and half of shaped charge liner shattered into 1 centimeter fragments 3 shaped charge liner was flattened 4 explosive charge pulverized into dust and 5 fuse did not arm. When using steel plates with and inch thicknesses all plates successfully removed fuse from warhead . The and inch thick plates also opened the warhead . Damage to projectile far exceeded expectations. The thickness of plate needed to successfully de arm projectile was unexpectedly small.

In the storage position of container shown in axis A of bore and axis B of container are horizontal and the pair of parallel sides of pivoting frame are in vertical planes. In this position the center of gravity L of pivoting frame is vertically above bore axis A. Pivoting frame may be secured in container against movement during routine shipping and handling in a manner similar to plate .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
