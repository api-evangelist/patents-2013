title: Camera positioning mechanism using an antagonistic pair of compliant contractile actuators
abstract: In a method of controlling a gaze direction of a camera, the camera is placed on a top surface of a substrate that is pivotally coupled to a frame, wherein a movement arm depends downwardly from the substrate. The movement arm is moved with two spaced apart amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators that are affixed to the frame and coupled to the movement arm by deforming the amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators as a result of applying a voltage thereto, thereby changing an angular orientation of the substrate.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 659 614 filed Jun. 14 2012 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under agreement No. ECCS 0932208 awarded by National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to camera positioning systems and more specifically to a camera positioning system using antagonistic actuators.

The human eye enables the brain to perceive large amounts of information quickly yet not all regions of space are perceived equally. Objects near the gaze direction or fovea receive the most attention a lesser amount of information is gathered about objects in the remainder of the field of view and some objects are out of the field of view and are not perceived. In this way the brain is not overwhelmed by information that is not of interest. Because the area of interest may change rapidly the eye can be reoriented with astounding performance by lightweight recti muscles. The recti muscles are contractile compliant actuators that are activated in discrete steps by neural impulses.

The human eyeball or globe is oriented by means of antagonistic pairs of recti and oblique muscles. The range of achievable orientations follows Donders Law and Listing s law both for saccadic motion and smooth pursuit. Antagonistic pairs of contractile actuators with insertion points into the globe are an important part of the eye s kinematics. In actuality eye muscles consist of a finite number of on off motor units or collection of muscle fibers innervated by a particular motor neuron. Cytoskeletal tissue couples the active acto myosin filaments to the load. It is believed that this property allows muscles to function well in unstructured environments since the elasticity of the muscle tends to return to a stable equilibrium when perturbed. Muscles are controlled by recruitment whereby the nervous system increases or decreases the number of motor units active to increase or decrease the amount of actuation. Each individual motor unit can only be on or off and it cannot be proportionally controlled.

Most camera positioners use heavy traditional servo motors. One example employs a cable driven mechanism that is actuated by traditional servomotors. A cable driven eye may be able to enforce the eye s kinematics but rigid servomotors do not actually follow the processes related to the neurological basis for natural eye motion. This is partly because servo motors tend to introduce velocity saturations and backlash. The resulting movement lacks the bandwidth of an actual eye.

The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention which in one aspect is a camera system that includes a frame that supports a substrate in a pivotal relationship along a first axis. A camera is disposed on the substrate. A first actuator is affixed to a first side the frame and is disposed along a second axis that is transverse to the first axis. A second actuator is affixed to a second side of the frame and is disposed along the second axis. The second side of the frame is opposite the first side of the frame so that the substrate is between the first side of the frame and the second side of the frame. The first actuator and the second actuator are both deformable in response to a signal. When the first actuator deforms away from the first side of the frame the second actuator deforms toward the second side of the frame and when the first actuator deforms toward from the first side of the frame the second actuator deforms away from the second side of the frame. A transverse member is disposed along a second axis that is transverse to the first axis. The transverse member mechanically couples the first actuator and the second actuator to the frame. The transverse member imparts deformation of the first actuator and the second actuator to the substrate in response to the signal so as to cause the substrate to pivot in relation to the frame thereby changing an angular orientation of the camera.

In another aspect the invention is a directional device that includes a frame that supports a substrate in a pivotal relationship along a first axis. A first amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator is affixed to a first side the frame and is disposed along a second axis transverse to the first axis. A second amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator is affixed to a second side of the frame and is disposed along the second axis. The second side of the frame is opposite the first side of the frame so that the substrate is between the first side of the frame and the second side of the frame. The first amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator and the second amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator are both mable in response to a signal. When the first amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator deforms away from the first side of the frame the second amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator deforms toward the second side of the frame. When the first amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator deforms toward from the first side of the frame the second amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator deforms away from the second side of the frame. A transverse member is disposed along a second axis that is transverse to the first axis. The transverse member mechanically couples the first amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator and the second amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator to the frame. The transverse member imparts deformation of the first amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator and the second amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator to the substrate in response to the signal so as to cause the substrate to pivot in relation to the frame to a predetermined orientation.

In yet another aspect the invention is a method of controlling a gaze direction of a camera in which the camera is placed on a top surface of a substrate that is pivotally coupled to a frame wherein a movement arm depends downwardly from the substrate. The movement arm is moved with two spaced apart amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators that are affixed to the frame and coupled to the movement arm by deforming the amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators as a result of applying a voltage thereto thereby changing an angular orientation of the substrate.

These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the following drawings. As would be obvious to one skilled in the art many variations and modifications of the invention may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure.

A preferred embodiment of the invention is now described in detail. Referring to the drawings like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. Unless otherwise specifically indicated in the disclosure that follows the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. As used in the description herein and throughout the claims the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein unless the context clearly dictates otherwise the meaning of a an and the includes plural reference the meaning of in includes in and on. 

As shown in one embodiment of a camera positioning system employs a frame on which is mounted a substrate . A pivot rod pivotally couples the substrate to the frame along a first axis . A camera may be mounted on the substrate . It should be recognized that other embodiments may be employed to position objects other than cameras. A movement arm depends downwardly from the substrate . A first actuator is mounted to a first side of the frame and a second actuator is mounted to a second opposite side of the frame . A transverse member is disposed along a second axis that is transverse to the first axis and that mechanically couples the first actuator and the second actuator to the substrate . The transverse member imparts the deformation of the first actuator and the second actuator to the substrate in response to the signal so as to cause the substrate to pivot in relation to the frame which changes the angular orientation of the camera.

The first actuator and the second actuator are both deformable in response to a signal such as a voltage signal . As shown in when the first actuator deforms away from the first side of the frame the second actuator deforms toward the second side of the frame which causes the transverse member to move toward the second side of the frame . As a result the movement arm is displaced along with the transverse member which causes the substrate to rotate in a counter clockwise direction. Similarly when a signal of opposite polarity is applied to the first actuator and to the second actuator the first actuator deforms toward from the first side of the frame and the second actuator deforms away from the second side of the frame which causes the transverse member to move toward the first side of the frame thereby causing clockwise rotation of the substrate .

In one embodiment the actuators and include amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators such as an actuator employing a lead zirconate titanate PZT ceramic which is contractile along one axis when a voltage is applied thereto . One method of making and using amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators is disclosed in Strain Amplification Devices and Methods U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009 0115292 A1 published on May 7 2009 and filed by Ueda et al. on Oct. 24 2008 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of disclosing amplified piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators and methods of making using and controlling the same.

As shown in a simple piezoelectric ceramic stack actuator employs a piezoelectric element that deforms in at least one direction when a voltage is applied thereto. The piezoelectric element is surrounded by a flexible loop which includes two first opposite surfaces and two second opposite surfaces that are disposed transversely to the two first opposite surfaces . One of the second opposite surfaces is affixed to a fixed surface such as a frame . The flexible loop can be made of a flexible material such as a metal strip or a plastic and can take the form of a non regular octagon it should be understood that many other shapes such as an oval could also be used . When the voltage is applied to the piezoelectric element as shown in the piezoelectric element expands and forces the two first opposite surfaces apart which forces two second opposite surfaces closer together. Because of the angular differences of the sides of the flexible loop the somewhat limited expansion of the piezoelectric element is amplified to substantially more movement between the two second opposite surfaces .

As shown in this amplification can be exaggerated by nesting piezoelectric ceramic stack actuators in flexible loops to make an amplified actuator . In this embodiment several piezoelectric ceramic actuators are stacked adjacently to each other with a peripheral flexible loop surrounding the stack thereby forming an amplified actuator unit . Several actuator units can then be stacked and an outer flexible loop can be placed around them to form a complex actuator . Because of the angular relationships of the sides of loops and a substantial amount of displacement between the sides of the complex actuator can be achieved with relatively little displacement of the piezoelectric elements in the ceramic actuators . Also by applying a voltage to only selected ones of the ceramic actuators the amount of displacement the complex actuator can be controlled with a relatively high level of precision. This mimics the way contraction of muscle fibers control movement of such things as eyeballs.

While above embodiment shows a single degree of freedom positioning system this system could employ gimbals to achieve multiple degrees of freedom
