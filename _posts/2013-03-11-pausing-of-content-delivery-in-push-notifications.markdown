This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 759 330 filed on Jan. 31 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

This disclosure relates to the field of push notifications and in particular to controlling the delivery of messages of push notifications.

Users often employ various computing devices e.g. computer systems laptop computers tablet computers netbook computers desktop computers server computers personal digital assistants PDAs cell phones smart phones gaming systems etc. to consume e.g. view watch listen hear or read media items such as broadcast sporting events and to interact with other users in relation to the media item using applications either third party or developed by the computing device manufacturer installed on the computing device. The application may be a sports related application in which users can obtain information about sports events and communicate with other users of the application about the sports events.

Such applications may provide for push notifications that forward information about the sporting event from a server supporting the application application server to the computing device. Push notifications may include for example messages that a sporting event has started or provide live real time information about a sports match such as changes in the score of a sports match while the sports match is in progress. Receiving score information may be undesirable at times for example when a person has recorded a broadcast of the sports match and wants to watch the sports match at a later time without knowing details about the sports match.

Conventional applications with notification features require the user to manually turn off notifications within an application at times when they do not want to receive notifications and then go back into an application to turn these notifications back on. Rather than going into each application to turn off notifications some computing device operating systems allow users to completely turn off notification functionality by going into the operating system notification settings and selectively turning off banners and alerts for all of the notification supported applications. Eventually a user would still have to go back into the operating system notifications settings and turn back on notifications for each of the applications. Whether through the operating system settings or individual application settings having to go back and turn on notifications can be a tedious process. Some operating systems allow a user to put all notifications on pause or disable them until the user goes back into the operating system notification settings and re enables the notification capability or sets a time period for which the notifications will be disabled and then turned back on. However such notification disablement features are applied generally to all applications running on the computing device.

Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure provide the ability for a user to control the delivery of notifications to a computing device relating to a particular event. For example an application relating to sporting events may provide users the ability to receive information relating to particular sporting events and also communicate with other users about particular sporting events. The application may be configured to send push notifications to the user from the application server about the scoring in the sporting event as it occurs and or to send notifications of messages from other users of the application relating to the scoring in the sporting event. However if the user has recorded a broadcast of the sporting event for viewing after the live sporting event has started the user may not want to receive information about the content of the push notifications i.e. the message relating to the sporting event since the content of the message may include spoiler information that would interfere with the user s enjoyment of watching the recorded broadcast of the sporting event.

Embodiments of the present disclosure provide for methods and systems for enabling a user to control the delivery of message notifications from an application s supporting server i.e. application server to a user s account or computing device having the application installed thereon. An application is any software e.g. program module service daemon script etc. that provides media event information for any type of computing platform e.g. mobile desktop gaming television cloud etc. such as mobile device applications RSS reader operating system etc. A notification message includes any type of message such as a text message multi media message e.g. picture video audio uniform resource locator URL etc. For some examples the notification may be in the form of a smart phone push notification e.g. including text image and or audio a banner feedback from a voice assistant a pop up overlay in a console video game or a mobile phone video game.

As an illustrative example of one embodiment a user may have recorded the broadcast of an International football also known in the United States as soccer and hereinafter referred to as soccer for ease of discussion match and started viewing the match sometime after the match has begun. The user of a sports application that provides information related to the match might not want to learn information e.g. goals scored about the match before the user has done so through watching the recorded broadcast itself. The user s friends however may be watching the live broadcast of the match and send messages to the user through the application such as My team is winning 1 0 or the application server may be monitoring the progress of the match and automatically sending a push notification of the score changes to the user via user configured alerts. The content of such messages may be referred to as spoiler information because is reveals information regarding the media e.g. score of the sporting match in a manner that spoils the user s enjoyment of the revelation of the information over the time and manner in which the user desires to learn of the information. Although the user may not actively be using the application the application may be set e.g. via alerts configurable by the user through the user interface of the application to send push notifications upon scoring in the match containing a message with scoring information e.g. from the application s server or message from another user of the application may be displayed on the lock screen of the computing device and undesirably seen by the user when the user picks up the computing device to receive a call or perform some function unrelated to the application or sporting event. If the user has not yet become aware of the content of the notification message through watching the recorded broadcast itself then the reading of such a notification message might spoil the user s continued watching of the recorded broadcast of the match.

It should be noted that for ease of discussion the present disclosure may refer to client device applications and . However an application can also be on the server e.g. application server or distributed among devices in alternative embodiments.

In the embodiment shown in client device A displays the real time score of the soccer match between Germany and Argentina . Additionally client device A displays message thread . Message thread is linked to the soccer match between Germany and Argentina and displays user generated messages and . Additionally message thread provides comment box in which a user can post a comment to message thread .

Client devices A B and C also known as recipient devices have been configured to receive notifications of messages posted to message thread . However the recipient devices A B and C have also been configured to pause the delivery of notification messages or notifications relating to the soccer match between Germany and Argentina beginning at the start of the match. For example client devices C B C A illustrated in the embodiment in are communicatively coupled to each other e.g. coupled to each other via a network . Message My team is winning 1 0 has been posted in message thread on client device A. The content of message relate to the match between Germany and Argentina. Once the message has been posted client device A sends out a notification and of the posting. Notification and can be sent directly to the recipient devices A C and B respectively or to a server device before being sent to the recipient devices and . Recipient devices B C and A have been configured to pause notification messages related the Germany versus Argentina match beginning at the start of the match. Consequently recipient devices B C and A have been configured to pause the delivery of message .

For the embodiment illustrated in client device A has removed the contents of message but has displayed the transmitting identity of notification as illustrated in message . Client device A displays identity information such as sender i.e. Brian Cotton and time posted i.e. one minute prior . Likewise client device C has removed the contents of message but has displayed the transmitting identity of notification as illustrated in message . Alternatively client device B has completely blocked any display of the receipt of notification . It should be noted that the notification can be blocked at the client device A C B or at a server device.

In the embodiment illustrated in recipient devices B C and A have received messages and respectively linked to the soccer match via message thread even though the recipient devices B C and A have been configured to pause message notifications related to the match and posted after the start of the match . It can be observed that each recipient device B C and A has received message Let s go out tonight message and demonstrate the received message. Recipient devices B C and A receive message because the message does not contain information related to the soccer match. In contrast the delivery of message My team is winning 1 0 has been paused on all recipient devices B C and A because it reveals spoiler information about the soccer match .

In one embodiment a user s account or accounts are configured to pause message delivery. A user account may be linked to multiple applications e.g. and and multiple devices e.g. A B and A . Consequently by configuring a single user account to pause message notifications multiple devices e.g. A B and A and applications e.g. and may be controlled. For example client device A and C can be linked by a single user account. Client device is a gaming console running an interactive soccer game application . Client device C is a mobile phone device running mobile application . The user by configuring a single user account can pause the delivery of message notifications e.g. and related to the Germany versus Argentina match on for example a single application e.g. on multiple applications e.g. and on a single device e.g. A or on multiple devices e.g. A C .

In one embodiment the message notifications to different user accounts of the same user may be controlled. For example a user may have an application with a first user account on a first computing device C e.g. a smart phone that is configured to provide push notifications about an event e.g. event . Further the user may also have another user account on a different computing device A e.g. a gaming console . In addition to pausing the push notifications sent to the application on the user s first computing device C e.g. a first user account relating to an event the user may also want to pause any messages that could be sent to another of their user accounts associated with another computing device A. For example the user may have a different account associated with on line gaming using a gaming console e.g. client device . The user may not want to receive from other users any spoiler information related to the event while they are playing an on line game unrelated to the event . The user may decide not to watch a soccer match live during its broadcast but rather choose to finish playing an on line soccer game during the first part of the live soccer match. In addition to the user configuring for example a soccer application e.g. on their mobile phone C to pause the delivery to the smart phone of messages notifications related to the match event the user may also want to pause or block the delivery of messages with spoiler content that are sent to their game console A. In one embodiment the applications are configured to request the user to provide user account information for the different user accounts for which the user wants to pause delivery of notifications or notification messages related to an event. In one embodiment the same user account may be used by both applications e.g. and on the different computing device platforms e.g. A and C . For example a user may be able to log into an application on their client device C e.g. mobile device platform using the same account information user name and password as a gaming application on a gaming device A platform. In another embodiment an application programming interface API may be used to interface the software on the different computing devices and or different computing device platforms for which the user has user accounts to communicate with each other.

In one embodiment the pausing of the notification is based on an event. In the embodiment illustrated in the pausing of notifications is based upon the start of the event e.g. kick off of the Germany versus Argentina soccer match. In an alternative embodiment the trigger for pausing the delivery of notification messages e.g. messages and is based on actions other than the start of an event such as the start of an intermediate period within an event . For example a user may start watching a sporting event e.g. live as it is being broadcasted but then cannot continue watching the second half of the sporting event e.g. live but rather records the broadcast for later viewing. In such an example the action triggering the pausing of the notification e.g. and delivery may be the start of the second half of the sporting event e.g. . In one embodiment other trigger actions may be used for example a user pausing the viewing through an application e.g. on a mobile device e.g. C or computer or through a set top box of a television of a broadcast of an event e.g. . The pausing of the viewing of the event e.g. whether a live broadcast or playback of a recording can be sent as a signal to the application e.g. or application server and used as a trigger for pausing the delivery of notifications related to the event e.g. . For example if a user pauses the viewing of a soccer match at 34 minutes in the first half the system would then pause any notification delivery or just block remove the message content of the notification at that time. When the user resumes viewing the broadcast of the event e.g. by pushing a play button such action may be used as a trigger for the paused notifications to be resumed but in one embodiment only those notifications that were received by the application server or application before the current place that the user is viewing the match. The trigger action could be performed through other actions outside of the application e.g. environment such as sending a text providing a command to a mobile device voice assistant etc.

In one embodiment application or may not provide a list of sources from which the delivery of message notifications is paused e.g. messages originating from message thread but rather application or or application server may utilize an artificial intelligence AI search algorithm to identify key words within notifications messages e.g. and to be sent to a user to determine whether to pause such notifications. For example for a soccer match in which Germany and Argentina are currently playing and for which the user does want to receive spoiler information the application or or application server may search for key words in any notification messages and . For example the AI search algorithm could search for words such as Germany Argentina scored winning team beating etc. that might potentially be related to the soccer match event for which the user wants to pause any notifications containing spoiler information. Subsequently delivery of the notification would be paused. In one embodiment the user can receive a prompt that a notification has been detected with messages containing content potentially related to the soccer match thus offering the user an option to receive the notification. In another embodiment the AI search algorithm may be utilized in combination with user selected events in which to associate messages. In yet another embodiment the application server looks at historical data stored for the user relating to previously viewed events e.g. a soccer match from last week and based on such information sends additional information to a user about upcoming events e.g. a soccer match to be broadcast tomorrow . In such a case the user may be prompted to indicate whether the user wants notifications paused that might be related to the upcoming event. In an alternative embodiment the user may be prompted to pause multiple upcoming events e.g. all Liverpool soccer matches as a safety net against receiving spoiler information in related threads and get prompted to unpause the delivery of notifications before seeing any messages.

In one embodiment information other than the message of the notification i.e. identity of the transmitting user and time of message notification may be sent to a user while the delivery of just the message of the notification is paused. In the embodiment illustrated in the application may deliver a notification e.g. displayed on the lock screen of the user s computing device that a particular user i.e. the particular user s account id has sent a message and the time the message was sent but not the content of the message e.g. My team is winning 1 0 . In one embodiment an alert that a message has been received can be displayed. In one embodiment in addition to removing the contents of the message a notice that someone has commented can be displayed rather than indicating the identity of the sender of the message. In this manner the user will know there are messages waiting for them with content related to a particular event but not see the content of the message until the delivery of the message is un paused or resumed.

In an alternative embodiment text messages related to an event may be paused. In one embodiment news alerts related to an event may be paused. In another embodiment notifications banners alerts and text chats related to an event may be paused. It should be noted that any form of communication related to an event may be paused.

In an alternative embodiment for example voice chat related to a media event may be paused. For example gamers may voice chart in real time while playing in a multi player networked game. Additionally users of text chat applications often choose to chat by voice rather than text. For example in the embodiment illustrated in client device A may be connected to other users via voice chat. When another user describes an event related to the Germany versus Argentina soccer match the contents of that message can be paused from the conversation.

The delivery of the message may be set by the user to be resumed in various manners. In one embodiment the user may define a second event like a time or event after which the delivery of notifications can resume. In one embodiment the delivery of paused notifications or notification messages may resume in response to an occurrence of a second action related to the event without prompting the user for example where the application e.g. or application server detects the posting of a message by the user in the event message thread e.g. relating to the event e.g. . In one embodiment a user may be prompted by the application e.g. and or the application server with a request whether to resume delivery of the content of the message e.g. and . The prompt may be initiated at certain time intervals related to the event e.g. end of the sporting event 24 hours after the start of the sporting event certain time intervals unrelated to the event e.g. twice a day or may be based upon the application e.g. and or application server receiving information from the user relating to the event e.g. . For example the user may finish viewing the recorded broadcast of the event and post a message related to the event through the application e.g. or application server. The application e.g. or application server can detect the posting of a message by the user in the event message thread e.g. and then in one embodiment prompt the user with a query whether to resume the delivery of the message or entire notifications as the embodiment may be that was paused. In another embodiment a user may be prompted whether to resume the delivery of messages when they open a paused message notification.

In the embodiment illustrated in GUI contains additional features that allow the user to control the appearance and content of paused notifications. Feature allows a user to remove the message contents of the notification but still receive notice that the user has received a message alert notification etc. For example in the embodiment illustrated in client device A and C both receive notification and respectively. However the content of the message has been removed and replaced with Message Paused message and . Nonetheless information contained in the transmitting identity is displayed. Feature allows the user to block the notification entirely. For example in the embodiment illustrated in client device B displays no indication of the receipt of notification . In such an instance a user will not receive the notification until after the pause notification period has expired or the user chooses to stop the pause of notifications. Allow allows content related to media event to be received despite being paused. For example in the embodiment illustrated in recipient client devices A B and C all received the message Let s go out tonight in message thread even though the message thread is related to the Germany versus Argentina soccer match and posted after the start of the event. Such a feature allows for messages containing non spoiler information to be visible while messages containing spoiler information to be paused even though the messages originate from the same media event.

In the embodiment illustrated in GUI contains additional features that allow the user to select different accounts and devices to apply a notification pause. Accounts feature allows the user to apply a notification pause to a single or multiple user accounts. Devices feature allows the user to apply a notification pause to a single or multiple devices while feature all devices allows a user to apply a notification pause to all devices associated with the selected user accounts. A single user account may be linked to more than one device. In the embodiment illustrated in recipient client devices A and B run different applications i.e. and respectively but could be linked to a single user account. Continuing the illustration a user can select to pause notification by listing his or her user account in Accounts and selecting feature all devices. Alternatively if the user has more than the two client devices A and B associated with a user account the user can elect to pause notification on client devices A and B but receive all notification on device Z for example. In order to invoke such a scenario in the current embodiment the user can enter his or her account information in Accounts and enter the applicable devices in Devices in this example client device A and C.

In one embodiment the user can click on message and read the contents of the message even though the message is displayed in GUI as Message Paused. Such a feature allows the user to pick and choose which paused messages the user reads. In another embodiment selecting paused message triggers a second action ending the notification pause. In still another embodiment selecting paused message will be followed by a prompt asking the user whether to end the message notification pause. In another embodiment the user may read messages that are not paused e.g. and without influencing the pause notification configuration.

It should be noted however that although the present disclosure may be discussed at times in relation to a sporting event for ease of explanation the present disclosure is not limited to sporting events and scores. In alternative embodiments the event may be other types of media events that can be consumed e.g. view watch listen hear or read by a user such as music concerts award shows e.g. Oscars movies news feeds and broadcasts political debates televisions programs etc. For example the application may be related to movies that allow users to message each other about the release of a new movie. Some users might not see the same show time of a movie. For example one user may see a showing of a movie that ends at 2 PM while another user may see a showing of the same movie that ends at 7 30 PM. Accordingly a user may want to set their application to pause message notifications to their user account or computing device based on the ending time of the particular movie showing that they intend to view. In alternative embodiments the events need not be live real time events.

The methods and systems described herein may also be used with alerts. While at times the term alert may be inappropriately used as a synonym for notification within the art an alert more precisely is a condition that is set by a user within an application that results in a notification being sent upon the occurrence of the condition. Notifications that are received due to the setting of an alert may be considered a controlled notification while those not received due to the control of the recipient user e.g. another user sending a text message may be considered an uncontrolled notification.

In the embodiment illustrated in the method may be performed by processing logic that comprises hardware e.g. circuitry dedicated logic programmable logic microcode etc. software e.g. instructions run on a processor or a combination thereof. In one embodiment method may be performed by a server device as illustrated in .

In the embodiment illustrated in method begins at block where the method determines if a notification associated with a media event is to be delivered to a user account. In one embodiment a user may sign up to receive various notifications. For example a user may want to receive notifications regarding a sporting event political event artistic event etc. In another embodiment a server application on a server device may independently determine whether to send a notification to a user account. Additional embodiments have been discussed above and apply here.

At block the method determines if a user account is configured to pause a notification. In one embodiment illustrated in a user may configure a user account so that notifications related to a media event are paused. If a user account has not been configured to pause notifications the method can skip to block and deliver the notification to the user account. However if a user account is configured to pause notifications method continues to block .

At block the method determines if a first action related to the media event has occurred. As discussed previously a first action may be user or system defined. For example a first action may be the start of a sporting event or the time of day. If a first action related to the media event has not occurred method can skip to block and continue the delivery of the notification. If a first action related to the media event has occurred method proceeds to block .

At block the method pauses a delivery of a message of the notification to the user account when a first action related to the media event has occurred. As explained above a pause in the delivery of a message of the notification can prevent a user from receiving spoiler information. After block the method proceeds to block .

In one embodiment method delivers a transmitting identity for the notification to the user account while pausing the delivery of the message. A user s account may or may not be configured to receive a transmitting identity for the notification. In one embodiment the contents of the message may be paused while additional information such as sender and time is sent to the user. In another embodiment no information will be sent to the user account unless a second action related to the media event has occurred and a pause in notification ended. It should be noted that the additional information sent to the user account is not limited to the sender or time stamp. For example additional information could be simply a notification sent to the user s account informing the user a message is waiting.

At block the method delivers if required the message of the notification when the message does not comprise a spoiler. In one embodiment if the message of the notification does not contain spoiler information the message may be delivered to a user s account while other messages that do contain spoiler information are paused. For example in the embodiment illustrated in message Let s go out tonight is delivered to the recipient devices even though messages from message thread have been paused. In one embodiment all messages regardless if they contain spoiler information or not can be paused. If it is determined that the message does not contain spoiler information and is to be delivered to the user s account then the method proceeds to block . If the message does contain spoiler information the method proceeds to block . It should be noted that if the user s account is not configured to allow messages not containing a spoiler block proceeds immediately to block .

In block the method determines if a second action related to the media event has occurred. In one embodiment a second action related to the media event may be user defined. For example a second action may be the end of a sporting event or a specified time. In another embodiment a second action related to the media event can be a user action. For example the user may open a paused message post a message on a message thread or finish watching the media event. If a second action related to the media event has not occurred the method proceeds to block and finishes. If a second action related to the media event has occurred the method proceeds to block .

In block the method determines if a second action related to the media event has occurred whether to resume delivery of the message to the user s account or prompt the user requesting whether to resume delivery of the message of the notification. In one embodiment a user may be prompted whether to continue the notification pause after a second action has occurred. For example a user may open a paused message wherein the system responds by prompting the user whether to resume delivery of the message and or end the pause of message notification. In another embodiment the occurrence of a second action will automatically resume the delivery of the message of the notification and or resume the delivery of previously paused notifications. Once the determination is made the method proceeds to block .

In block the method resumes the delivery of the message to the user s account except when the user requests otherwise. If the method resumes the delivery of the message the message is sent to the user s account the pause of notifications is ended and messages previously paused are delivered. In one embodiment a user may request to continue the pause of notifications in which case the method proceeds to block and is finished. In another embodiment a user may request the receipt of a single paused message but wish to resume the pause of notification. After block the method proceeds to block and is finished.

The client devices A through N and client devices A through N include applications A through N and A through N respectively. The application may provide a user with a portal or gateway e.g. a single point of access to consume or access media items such as sporting events or to interact with other users in relation to the media items using applications. The applications may be sports related video games email etc. The applications may provide for push notifications that forward information about the sporting event from a server device supporting the applications. The application may provide or transmit information to the server device . Likewise the server device may provide and transmit information to the client devices through the application.

In the embodiment illustrated in computer device includes a processing device a main memory e.g. read only memory ROM flash memory dynamic random access memory DRAM such as synchronous DRAM SDRAM a static memory e.g. flash memory static random access memory SRAM and a data storage device which communicate with each other via a bus .

The processing device is configured to execute processing logic e.g. pausing notifications or associating devices to user accounts for performing the operations and steps discussed herein.

In one embodiment processing device determines that a notification to be delivered to a user account is associated with an event and pausing by processing device without intervention by the user of the user account a delivery of a notification message to the user account until an action related to the event has occurred. For example in the embodiment illustrated in notification and have been sent from client device A. Processing device located in client device A or server device determines whether the notifications and are to be delivered to a user account. If the processing device determines that notifications and are to be delivered to a user account the processing device determines whether to pause the delivery of the notification messages associated with notifications and . For example in the illustrative embodiment in messages of notifications of and have not been delivered to client devices A C and B respectively. For example in client device C the notification message has been replaced with Message Paused. The processing device may be located within the application server or within the user s computing device or the operation performed by the processing device may be distributed among the devices

The computer device may represent either the application server or a user computing device running an application for example applications and within which a set of instructions for causing the computer or machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be executed. In alternative embodiments the machine may be connected e.g. networked to other machines in a LAN an intranet an extranet or the Internet. The machine may operate in the capacity of a server machine in client server network environment. The machine may be a personal computer PC a set top box STB a server a network router switch or bridge or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Further while only a single machine is illustrated the term machine shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set or multiple sets of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.

The computer device may further include a network interface device which may communicate with a network . The computer device also may include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse and a signal generation device e.g. a speaker .

In the above description numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form rather than in detail in order to avoid obscuring the description.

Some portions of the detailed description are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the above discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as receiving determining analyzing pausing receiving identifying sending or the like refer to the actions and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

Embodiments of the disclosure also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
