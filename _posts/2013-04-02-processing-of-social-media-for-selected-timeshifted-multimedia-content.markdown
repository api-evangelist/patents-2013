The present application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 802 076 filed Mar. 15 2013 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The present application is also related to application Ser. No. 13 855 686 filed Mar. 16 2013.

A consumer may record broadcast multimedia content so that they may view that multimedia content at some later time after the original broadcast. For example a consumer may such as by using a home or network based digital video recorder DVR cause a device to record or otherwise store a television program so that the consumer may view that television program at some later time time shifting .

Also while consuming multimedia content e.g. while watching a broadcast television program many consumers use social networking services to view social media related to that multimedia content.

Many providers of multimedia content are able to re broadcast or otherwise provide multimedia content at some later time after an original broadcast of that multimedia content. For example nationally or internationally important multimedia content or culturally important multimedia such as a classic sporting event may be re broadcast or streamed several years or decades after its original broadcast or may be made available on an on demand basis. Recorded multimedia content may also be made available to consumers as tangible recordings such as DVDs.

A consumer may be presented with social media that relates to multimedia content that the consumer has not yet consumed but that the consumer intends to consume at a later time e.g. on a time shifted basis. The term time shifting encompasses delays of any length of time prior to time shifted viewing. For example time shifting can include short delays such as those caused by purposefully pausing live content during a broadcast such that the live content will be briefly buffered or otherwise recorded in a DVR prior to time shifted viewing. The term time shifting can also encompass delays of hours days or years prior to time shifted viewing. As a result of time shifting such social media may contain spoilers or other information that may if the consumer were to be privy to that information have a detrimental effect upon the consumer s enjoyment of the multimedia content. For example a consumer may record a television program that they intend to watch later. However the consumer may still be exposed to social media posts that may contain information e.g. spoilers about that television program. Such consumers may desire to remove information relating to certain multimedia content from social media. Accordingly content providers including for example creators and distributors of multimedia content cable and broadband service providers multiple system operators MSOs and other types of service providers associated with the multimedia content may desire to enable a consumer to continue using social networking services while not being exposed to social media that relates to certain multimedia content.

Providing to consumers of a multimedia content social media that has been created or published by consumers of one or more earlier broadcasts of that multimedia content may enhance the viewing experience of the consumers. Also it may be beneficial to provide storage e.g. long term storage filtering and or indexing of social media posts relating to certain multimedia broadcasts. In some cases it may be beneficial to store social media posts relating to certain multimedia broadcasts for posterity.

As used herein with respect to social media posts a stream or streaming of social media posts should not be understood to limit the transmitting receiving or storing of social media posts to a particular protocol interface or standard. Streaming of social media posts in various embodiments can encompass any way of sending or receiving social media posts on a network e.g. without regard to any particular method for delivering requesting sending or retrieving such posts and without regard to whether or not such posts are provided contemporaneously or in any particular order flow or sequence of posts. A stream of social media posts in some embodiments can include any set group or collection of one or more social media posts e.g. without regard to any particular method or protocol by which such posts are streamed or stored.

As used herein a publisher means a source of one or more social media posts on a social networking service for example an identified or identifiable writer publisher distributor redistributor or social networking user who posts or reposts social media posts. In an embodiment a social networking user is able to be a publisher and therefore a publisher is a more specific category within the general category of social networking users. Conventionally each user is associated with user information which includes a unique user identifier or userid for use in a social networking service. A publisher s user identifier is useful for other users who wish to identify social media posts by the publisher which may be indexed by or retrievable by the publisher s user identifier. A user s user information also can include one or more affinities of the user e.g. the user may choose to publicly share an affinity for a particular sports team city celebrity or other subject. An affinity can be positive negative or expressed in any of numerous ways of indicating or ranking an interest in or a liking or disliking of the subject of the affinity.

As used herein a social connection list means a list table or other data that identifies one or more additional users or groups of users associated with the user for example user selected friends connections contacts publishers followed publishers subscribed to users in a social networking circle users in a social networking group or subgroup or other selected individuals entities or groups. A user of a social networking service is conventionally able to have at least one user specific social connection list for the social networking service. Social connection lists enable a user to select or identify other users whose posts are of interest to the user. In some embodiments a stream of social networking posts received by a given user is limited by the social networking service prior to processing by the filtering module e.g. limited to publishers in a social connection list of the user.

Embodiments include methods of and apparatus for processing social media posts. The methods include a filtering module configured to receive e.g. from a social networking service a stream that includes one or more social media posts. The filtering module is able to acquire one or more filtering criteria which can for example include one or more identifiers such as a keyword or hashtag which are usable to identify a social media post as relating to certain multimedia content . In a first embodiment the filtering module using the acquired filtering criteria is able to filter the received stream to extract from the stream those social media posts that relate to the certain multimedia content.

In another embodiment the filtering module is able to use a first portion of the one or more filtering criteria to request and receive a filtered stream of one or more social media posts for example the first portion may include criteria for limiting the social media posts to those posted by desired or specified sources or publishers.

In a further embodiment the filtering module is able to apply a second portion of the one or more filtering criteria to the received stream of social media posts for extracting only those social media posts conforming to all of the one or more filtering criteria.

Without providing the extracted social media posts for playback at a current time on a playback device an embodiment of the filtering module is then able to store e.g. within a database the extracted social media posts for future provision to the playback device.

Further embodiments include further methods of and apparatus for processing social media posts. The further methods include certain multimedia content being identified e.g. by a provider maker or broadcaster of that multimedia content or by a provider of a social networking service or by any other party as multimedia content for which social media posts relating to a broadcast of that multimedia content are to be stored. Using this identifying information one or more filtering criteria are provided e.g. specified generated or determined for use by a filtering module.

In some embodiments the filtering module receives e.g. from a social networking service a stream including a plurality of social media posts that have been published concurrently with a presentation e.g. a broadcast a unicast a multicast etc. of certain multimedia content filters the received stream using the filtering criteria to extract social media posts that relate to the broadcast of the certain multimedia content and stores e.g. in a database the extracted social media posts. In other embodiments a storage module stores the stream of social media posts and a filtering module then filters the stored social media posts using the filtering criteria to identify e.g. extract social media posts that relate to the broadcast of the certain multimedia content.

In further embodiments the filtering module also receives e.g. from a social networking service a further stream including a plurality of social media posts that have been published by a user while that user is consuming the certain multimedia content on a time shifted basis with respect to the earlier presentation of the multimedia content. The filtering module then filters the received further stream using the filtering criteria to extract social media posts that relate to the broadcast of the certain multimedia content and stores e.g. in the database the extracted social media posts.

In some of the foregoing embodiments instead of or in addition to storing the extracted social media posts the filtering module is able to store indicia such as Universal Resource Locators URLs pointers or other identifiers corresponding to the extracted social media posts for enabling future retrieval and presentation of the extracted social media posts e.g. from a network accessible storage device database server or archive. In further embodiments instead of or in addition to storing the extracted social media posts the filtering module is able to store some function e.g. a hash of the extracted social media posts or information that may be used to identify the extracted social media posts such as a time reference and composer information for enabling the distinguishing of the extracted social media posts from other social media posts e.g. in a replayed or played back stream of social media posts received from a social networking service .

The following description is based on embodiments of the invention and should not be taken as limiting the invention with regard to alternative embodiments that are not explicitly described herein.

Apparatus for implementing any of the below described arrangements and performing any of the below described method steps can be provided by configuring or adapting any suitable apparatus for example one or more computers or other processing apparatus or processors and or providing additional modules. The apparatus can for example include a computer a network of computers or one or more processors for implementing instructions and using data including instructions and data in the form of a computer program or plurality of computer programs stored in or on a machine readable storage medium such as computer memory a computer disk ROM magnetic or optical media solid state media etc. or any combination of these or other storage media.

It should be noted that certain of the process steps depicted in the below described process flowcharts i.e. may be omitted or such process steps may be performed in differing order to that presented below and shown in those process flowcharts. Furthermore although all the process steps have for convenience and ease of understanding been depicted as discrete temporally sequential steps nevertheless some of the process steps may in fact be performed simultaneously or at least overlapping to some extent temporally.

Referring now to the Figures is a schematic illustration not to scale showing a television TV program . The TV program is used herein to illustrate embodiments of a method of processing social media posts. Embodiments of such processes will be described in more detail later below with reference to . Examples of the TV program include an item or segment of multimedia content encoded for broadcast multicast unicast streaming or storage e.g. as analog and or digital video data encoded for example in an MPEG 2 DVB MPEG 4 AVC H.265 HEVC H.265 or other type of program stream or bit stream or otherwise digitally encoded .

The TV program may be consumable by a consumer using any appropriate playback device for rendering multimedia content e.g. a set top box media player desktop or laptop computer a tablet computer smartphone or other mobile device or a display device such as a monitor or television . The TV program in the depicted example runs from its start time at time t 0 to its end time at time t T.

It will be appreciated that in other embodiments that processing social media posts may be implemented with a different type of media presentation multimedia content e.g. a movie a radio broadcast etc. instead of or in addition to the TV program . The media presentation may also include a multi device presentation i.e. a multimedia presentation to be shown on more than one different device. For example the media presentation may include a video presentation to be shown on a first device and a supplemental presentation e.g. additional textual and or graphical information or interactive features to be shown on a second device. The TV program may be of any genre for example a history documentary a news broadcast an entertainment program a sports program etc.

Although the illustrative example of the TV program is depicted as running from its start time at time t 0 to its end time at time t T it will be understood that the running time of TV program may in practice be interrupted by breaks such as for advertisements public service announcements and the like. For example one embodiment of TV program may include no commercial breaks or advertising segments. A further embodiment of TV program may include advertising segments or splice points or other indicators for ad insertion without including any portion of time allocated for such segments as part of the running time of TV program . Further embodiments of the TV program may include commercial breaks within its running time for example a historical TV program may include pre recorded advertising segments e.g. advertisements that were contemporaneously recorded during a broadcast of the TV program . Accordingly in some cases the breaks may be included in the running time of TV program . Such breaks advertising segments and similar material are to be appropriately taken into account when determining a temporal identifier that corresponds to a specified point t during the TV program . Non limiting examples of a temporal identifier include a time indicator identifying an absolute or relative date and time an ISO 8601 representation a timestamp using Coordinated Universal Time UTC or other time indicator identifying an offset from a known time such as the start time of TV program . It will be understood that various kinds of information e.g. embedded metadata third party metadata for enabling determination of an appropriate temporal identifier are known in the art.

A point in the TV program hereinafter referred to as the point and shown in as a dotted line within the TV program and indicated by the reference numeral occurs at a time within the TV program i.e. at time t twhere tmay be any time point in the TV program between t 0 and t T. The point may be any point in the TV program in relation to which a user of a social networking service may create or publish a social media post. For example the point may be the start or end of a certain scene within the TV program or the point may be at or proximate to a point within the TV program at which an event occurs e.g. if the TV program is an athletics program the point may be at or proximate to the end of an athletics event within that show e.g. where a user of a social networking service may comment about the results of that event .

The social media post may be any appropriate type of social media post created or published by a publisher or a user of any type of social networking service or otherwise posted or reposted using that service. For example the social media post may be a Twitter post or tweet made using the Twitter social networking service. Also for example the social media post may be a Google post made using the Google social networking service. Also for example the social media post may be a Facebook post e.g. a Facebook status update made using the Facebook social networking service. The foregoing well known examples are provided for illustrative purposes and social media posts are in no way limited to or by those examples.

The social media post is published e.g. by a user of a social networking service in relation to the point within the TV program . In other embodiments the social media post is published in relation to one or more different points or ranges within the TV program instead of or in addition to the point .

The social media post includes an identifier a time indicator and content . In some embodiments the post includes a plurality of instances of identifier .

An identifier can comprise any kind or collection of metadata that describes the social media post . For example in an embodiment an identifier comprises a unique identifier for the social media post within an associated namespace e.g. a unique identifier that can be used for looking up or otherwise referencing or locating the social media post and that can accordingly be used to associate the social media post with other post specific metadata or information. In further embodiments the identifier can comprise any kind or collection of metadata that can be used e.g. by browsing or searching for the identifier to find detect and or extract the social media post from a stream database or other local or remote collection of social media posts.

In some embodiments the identifier includes post specific metadata or can be used to associate the post with post specific metadata that identifies and or can be used to identify the publisher of the social media post .

In further embodiments the identifier includes post specific metadata or can be used to associate the post with post specific metadata that identifies and or can be used to identify the social media post as relating to one or more subjects topics or entities. For example the identifier may include metadata that identifies the social media post as relating to the TV program or e.g. as specifically relating to the point within the TV program . The identifier may be but is not limited to being a tag a keyword or term e.g. a non hierarchical keyword or term or a hashtag.

The identifier of the social media post can be created or specified by any appropriate process e.g. the identifier may be specified by a creator or publisher of the social media post or the identifier may be generated automatically by one or more processors. In some embodiments the identifier is editable for example by a creator or publisher of the social media post . In some embodiments a social media post includes one or more instances of identifier e.g. a plurality of identifiers that for example identify the social media post as relating to a plurality of different subjects topics or entities.

The time indicator is post specific metadata that specifies time information relating to the social media post . In some embodiments time indicator is included in the social media post in other embodiments the identifier can be used to look up or otherwise determine a time indicator associated with post . This time information can include for example a time and date at which the social media post was published. The time information can also in an illustrative example include a time relative to multimedia content to which the social media post relates. For example if the social media post relates to the point within the TV program the time indicator specifies the time within the TV program of the point i.e. t t . The time indicator of the social media post can be created or specified by any appropriate process e.g. the time indicator can be specified by a creator or publisher of the social media post or be generated automatically by one or more processors. In some embodiments the time indicator is editable for example by a creator of the social media post .

The content of the social media post includes information specified by the publisher or creator of the social media post that is to be consumed by e.g. displayed to a consumer of the social media post . In a simplified embodiment the content is text e.g. a string of ASCII text and is generally limited in length or size. In some embodiments one or more instances of an identifier may be included within the content for example an identifier can be a keyword term or hashtag that is included within the text of content . In further embodiments the content can include for example one or more instances of various types of content such as text an audio recording a video an image or picture a hypertext link etc. In an embodiment the subjects topics or entities to which the content relates are those that are specified by the identifier . For example the content of the social media post may relate to the TV program e.g. the content may be text that the publisher or creator of the social media post writes in response to viewing the TV program and the identifier of that social media post may specify the TV program . Furthermore the time indicator may include time information for the content . For example the content may relate to the point within the TV program and the time indicator may specify the time i.e. t t within the TV program of the point .

The social media post may be consumable by a consumer using any appropriate client device e.g. media player desktop or laptop computer a tablet computer smartphone or other mobile device or a display device such as a monitor or television . Some or all of the content of the social media post may be created or specified by any appropriate process e.g. the content may be specified by a creator or publisher of the social media post or a portion of the content may be generated automatically by one or more processors. In some embodiments the content is editable for example by a creator or publisher of the social media post .

Suitable devices include but are not limited to a desktop personal computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a mobile station an entertainment appliance a wireless phone a smartphone a netbook a game console etc.

The social networking service provider is a provider of a social networking service. The networking service provider provides an online service e.g. a website an application an application programming interface etc. that enables or facilitates users of the social networking service to for example create a social connection list which can be useful for building or enhancing social networks or social relations with people who for example share common interests activities backgrounds or real life connections. Well known illustrative examples of a social networking service provider include Twitter Google and Facebook however social networking service providers are in no way limited to or by the foregoing examples. In the example network the social networking service provider is connected via the Internet to the filtering module such that social media posts that have been created or published by users of the social networking service are provided by the social networking service provider to the filtering module .

In some embodiments there are a plurality of different social networking service providers that may for example each supply a respective stream of social media posts to the filtering module .

The filtering module is a facility apparatus for receiving processing and re distributing social media posts sent to it from the social networking service provider . The functionality of the filtering module is described in more detail later below with reference to . In some embodiments the filtering module is configured to extract certain social media posts from a feed of social media posts received by it from social networking service provider in accordance with one or more filtering criteria acquired e.g. received or generated by the filtering module .

In addition to being coupled to the social networking service provider in the example network the filtering module is coupled via the Internet to the session manager such that information sent by the session manager is received by the filtering module .

Also in the example network the filtering module is coupled e.g. either by a wireless or wired connection to the database . This coupling is such that in use data relating to social media posts that have been extracted from a stream of such posts is sent from the filtering module to the database for storage by the database .

In some embodiments the data related to the extracted social media posts that is stored in the database includes the content of those social media posts and or the time indicators of those social media posts and or the identifier of those social media posts. In further embodiments instead of or in addition to comprising the content of the extracted social media posts the data related to the extracted social media posts that is stored in the database includes indicia corresponding to the extracted social media posts for enabling future retrieval and presentation of the extracted social media posts or includes information that may be used to identify social media posts that match the extracted social media posts and are within a stream of social media posts e.g. a replayed or played back stream of social media posts received by the filtering module such that the identifying information can be used to identify a corresponding subset of one or more of the social media posts. Accordingly the database can in various embodiments be used to store extracted social media posts in their entirety or to store their content or to index the extracted social media posts so as to allow for future retrieval.

Furthermore the coupling between the filtering module and the database is such that the information stored in the database may be retrieved from the database by the filtering module .

Also in the example network the filtering module is coupled e.g. either by a wireless or wired connection to the social networking client . This coupling is such that information e.g. social media posts can be sent from the filtering module to the social networking client e.g. for presentation by the social networking client to the user .

The social networking client is a client module that corresponds to the social networking service provider and is configured to be able to present e.g. display for consumption by the user social media posts created or published by users of the social networking service provided by the social networking service provider . The social networking client may be for example a Twitter client a Google client or a Facebook client or other type of software application configured to access data from the social networking service provider e.g. by use of published or unpublished application programming interfaces or protocols. The social networking client operates on a playback device such as a desktop personal computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a mobile station an entertainment appliance a set top box communicatively coupled to a television a wireless phone a smartphone a netbook a game console etc.

The user is a user and or operator of the TV and the social networking client . The user is a user of the social networking service provided by the social networking provider .

In some embodiments functionality provided by one or more of the entities in the example network may be provided by an additional entity or a different entity of the network . For example in some embodiments the functionality provided by the session manager and described in more detail later below with reference to is provided by the set top box and or TV .

In some embodiments the entities of the example network are connected together in a different way to that described above.

In some embodiments certain entities of the example network are located in the same device or provided by the same apparatus. For example in some embodiments the packager the EPG and the session manager are provided by a common module e.g. a cable head end. However in other embodiments one or more of the packager the EPG and the session manager are provided by separate different apparatus to the others. Also for example in some embodiments the filtering module the database and the social networking client are provided by or located on or in a common apparatus or device e.g. a playback device such as a desktop personal computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a mobile station an entertainment appliance a set top box communicatively coupled to a television a wireless phone a smartphone a netbook a game console etc. However in other embodiments one or more of the filtering module the database and the social networking client are provided by separate different apparatus to the others.

At s broadcast programming or scheduling information for current and upcoming TV programs is displayed to the user e.g. on the TV . This information may for example have been provided for display on the TV by the EPG e.g. via the packager the session manager and the set top box . Alternatively the broadcast programming or scheduling information is displayed to the user by a different module or device e.g. the social networking client or a web browser.

At s the user selects the TV program to be recorded so that the user may watch the TV program at some later time which may be after the broadcast of the TV program . This selection of the TV program for recording by the user is performed using any appropriate mechanism. For example the user can select using a controller of the TV the TV program from a list upcoming TV programs that is displayed on the TV .

At s an indication that the user has selected the TV program to be recorded is sent to the session manager e.g. from the TV via the set top box . This indication identifies the TV program and specifies that the TV program is to be recorded when it is provided by the content provider i.e. when the TV program is provided for presentation i.e. for broadcast unicast multicast etc. .

The indication received by the session manager may include an instruction to the session manager to record the TV program when the TV program is sent to the session manager by the packager .

At s an indication that the user has selected the TV program to be recorded is sent to the packager from the session manager . This indication identifies the TV program and specifies that the TV program is to be recorded when it is broadcast.

At s the packager acquires scheduling information for the TV program from the EPG . This scheduling information may for example include the start time and the end time for the upcoming broadcast of the TV program .

Also at s in response to receiving the indication that the user has selected the TV program to be recorded the packager acquires one or more identifiers that may identify and or be used to identify a social media post as relating to the TV program . For example the packager may acquire one or more tags keywords key terms or hashtags that relate to the TV program . The acquired identifiers are metadata that enable e.g. by browsing or searching a stream of social media posts the finding or detection of e.g. within that stream of social media posts those social media posts that relate to the TV program or events occurring therein. Also the acquired identifiers are metadata that enable e.g. by browsing or searching a stream of social media posts the extracted from that stream of social media posts those social media posts that relate to the TV program or events occurring therein.

Any appropriate process may be used at s to acquire the one or more identifiers . For example the packager may retrieve the identifiers from a database of such identifiers. Also for example the packager may acquire identifiers from the maker of the TV program or the provider of the TV program i.e. the content provider after identifiers have been specified by the maker or provider of the TV program . Also for example the packager may acquire identifiers from the social networking service provider . Also for example identifiers may be manually specified e.g. by an operator the packager or automatically generated for the packager e.g. by in effect predicting appropriate keywords hashtags etc. . Also for example the packager may acquire identifiers from the user .

Thus at step s the filtering module acquires one or more filtering criteria which specify media content i.e. content specific filtering criteria . In some embodiments the filtering module acquires a different type of content specific filtering criteria instead of or in addition to identifiers that may be used by the filtering module to extract social media posts from the input stream.

At s the acquired scheduling information or timing information and identifiers relating to the TV program are sent from the packager to the filtering module e.g. via the session manager and the Internet . The filtering module receives the timing information and identifiers relating to the TV program .

At s the content provider provides the TV program for broadcast. The TV program is provided to the session manager e.g. via the packager which may for example encode the TV program in an appropriate multimedia container.

At s in response to having received the indication that the user has selected the TV program to be recorded the session manager records the received TV program . The TV program is recorded such that at a later time e.g. sometime after the original broadcast of the TV program the TV program may be played back to the user . In other words the TV program is recorded such that the user may consume the TV program on a time shifted basis with respect to the earlier or original presentation e.g. broadcast unicast multicast etc. of the TV program . Recording of the TV program by the session manager is performed using any appropriate process and apparatus. For example the session manager may record the received TV program in a local memory.

Concurrently with the session manager recording the TV program the TV program provided for display and may be displayed e.g. using further TVs to consumers who are different to the user . For example the TV program may be consumed by other users of the social networking service provided by the social networking service provider .

At s concurrently with the presentation of the TV program one or more users of the social networking service provided by the social networking service provider that are consuming the TV program create or publish social media posts that relate to the TV program . An identifier of such a social media post indicates that that social media post relates to the TV program . A time indicator of such a social media post indicates that that social media post was published or created between the start time and end time of the TV program .

At s the social networking service provider provides social media posts as a stream of social media posts to the filtering module . This stream of social media posts includes social media posts that relate to the TV program i.e. the social media posts published or created at step s . This stream of social media posts may also include one or more social media posts that do not relate to the TV program and instead may relate to some other subject.

The stream of social media posts received by the filtering module at step s may have been received by the filtering module in response to an initial set of filtering criteria e.g. that may have been specified by the filtering module . These filtering criteria may specify certain users of the social networking service whose social media posts are to be provided to the filtering module . These filtering criteria may be user specific filtering criteria and not comprise content specific filtering criteria. Thus the stream of social media posts received by the filtering module at step s may be a user specific input stream.

At s the filtering module filters the received input stream of social media posts so as to extract from the received stream those social media posts that relate to the TV program .

In this embodiment the extraction process of s is performed using the identifiers relating to the TV program sent to the filtering module from the packager at s. For example the filtering module identifies those social media posts in the stream of social media posts whose identifier s match one or more of the identifiers received from the packager . In other words the filtering module filters the received stream of social media posts using the identifiers received from the packager . The filtering module then extracts from the input stream those social media posts that include an identifier that matches one or more of the identifiers received from the packager .

In some embodiments in addition to filtering dependent upon the identifiers received by the filtering module from the packager the extraction process performed by the filtering module at s may use the timing information relating to the TV program sent to the filtering module from the packager at s. For example the filtering module may only extract from the input stream those social media posts whose time indicator indicates that that social media post corresponds to a time between the start time and end time of the TV program . In other words the filtering module may only extract from the stream those social media posts that have been published during the presentation of the TV program .

Thus at s social media posts that relate to the TV program and have been created or published during the broadcast of the TV program may be extracted from the stream of social media posts .

At s the social media posts that have been extracted from the stream of social media posts by the filtering module are stored or indexed in the database . In other words in an embodiment the filtering module sends the social media posts extracted from the stream at s or sends data related to the extracted social media posts to the database for storage or indexing.

The data stored in the database for an extracted social media post is usable to ascertain a time reference e.g. a time indicator for that social media post such that that social media posts can be provided for playback by a playback device synchronously with a playback by the user of the TV program . For example the data stored in the database for an extracted social media post comprises a time reference for that social media post.

The data stored in the database for an extracted social media post may be indicative of an opinion expressed in that social media post e.g. by the creator or publisher of the social media post . The opinion expressed in the social media post may relate to any subject such as the TV program or events occurring within the TV program . This opinion information may for example be based upon social voting tools such as star ratings or flags or like buttons that allow viewers to tag social media posts. Alternatively this opinion information may be manually specified or specified by using AI based natural language processing or otherwise. As described in more detail later below with reference to during playback of social media posts the filtering module may filter social media posts depending on the opinion information such that only those social media posts whose opinion information satisfies certain criteria are presented to a user.

At s the social media posts that have not been extracted from the stream of social media posts by the filtering module are sent to the social networking client . The social networking client provides e.g. displays the received social media posts for consumption by the user . At s those social media posts that have been extracted from the stream by the filtering module i.e. those social media posts that relate to the TV program are in this embodiment not sent to the social networking client .

Thus a method of processing social media posts which includes the extraction of social media posts from a stream of social media posts is provided.

At s broadcast programming or scheduling information for current and upcoming TV programs is displayed to the user . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

At s the user selects the TV program to be recorded so that the user may watch the TV program at some later time. This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

At s an indication that the user has selected the TV program to be recorded is sent to the session manager . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

At s the user or another party provides the filtering module with one or more identifiers that may identify and or be used to identify a social media post as relating to the TV program . For example the user may specify one or more tags keywords key terms or hashtags that relate to the TV program which may then be used by the filtering module . For example if filtering module and social networking client are located in the same playback device e.g. a computer of the user the user may input one or more identifiers into that playback device. The identifiers supplied by the user may include any kind of metadata that can be used e.g. by browsing or searching a stream of social media posts to find or detect within that stream of social media posts those social media posts that relate to the TV program or events occurring therein. The identifiers supplied by the user may include any kind of metadata that is usable to extract from a stream of social media posts those social media posts that relate to the TV program or events occurring therein.

Any appropriate process may be used by the user at s to provide the one or more identifiers . For example the user may retrieve the identifiers from a database of such identifiers. Also for example the user may acquire identifiers from the maker of the TV program or the provider of the TV program i.e. the content provider after identifiers have been specified by the maker or provider of the TV program . Also for example the user may acquire identifiers from the social networking service provider . Also for example the user may make up or guess appropriate identifiers .

Thus at step s the filtering module acquires one or more filtering criteria which specify media content i.e. content specific filtering criteria . In some embodiments the filtering module acquires a different type of content specific filtering criteria instead of or in addition to identifiers that may be used by the filtering module to extract social media posts from the input stream.

At s the user or another party provides the filtering module with scheduling or timing information relating to the TV program . This timing information includes the start time and the end time of the TV program . The user may for example manually input the timing information into the filtering module . For example if filtering module and social networking client are located in the same client device e.g. a computer of the user the user may input the timing information for the TV program into that client device. Scheduling or timing information for the TV program may be acquired by the user e.g. by the user viewing scheduling information provided by the EPG on the TV .

At s the content provider provides the TV program to the session manager for presentation. This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

At s the session manager records the received TV program . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of . Similarly to s concurrently with the session manager recording the TV program the TV program may be displayed e.g. using further TVs to consumers who are different to the user .

At s concurrently with the presentation of the TV program users of the social networking service provided by the social networking service provider that are consuming the TV program as it is presented create or publish social media posts that relate to the TV program . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

At s the social networking service provider provides social media posts as a stream of social media posts to the filtering module . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

At s the filtering module filters the received stream of social media posts so as to extract from the input stream those social media posts that relate to the TV program . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of . Thus at s social media posts that relate to the TV program and have been created or published during the broadcast of the TV program are extracted from the stream of social media posts .

At s the social media posts that have been extracted from the stream of social media posts by the filtering module are stored or indexed in the database . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

The data stored in the database for an extracted social media post is usable to ascertain a time reference e.g. a time indicator for that social media post such that that social media posts can be provided for playback by a playback device synchronously with a playback by the user of the TV program . For example the data stored in the database for an extracted social media post comprises a time reference for that social media post.

The data stored in the database for an extracted social media post may be indicative of an opinion expressed in that social media post e.g. by the creator or publisher of the social media post . The opinion expressed in the social media post may relate to any subject such as the TV program or events occurring within the TV program . This opinion information may for example be based upon social voting tools such as star ratings or flags or like buttons that allow viewers to tag social media posts. Alternatively this opinion information may be manually specified or specified by using AI based natural language processing or otherwise. As described in more detail later below with reference to during playback of social media posts the filtering module may filter social media posts depending on the opinion information such that only those social media posts whose opinion information satisfies certain criteria are presented to a user.

At s the social media posts that have not been extracted from the stream of social media posts by the filtering module are sent to the social networking client . The social networking client provides the received social media posts for consumption by the user . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

Thus at s social media posts that do not relate to the TV program are sent to the social networking client so that they may be provided for consumption by the user . However social media posts that relate to the TV program and have been extracted from the stream of social media posts are not sent to the social networking client at the current time.

Thus a further method of processing social media posts which includes the extraction of social media posts from a stream of social media posts is provided.

An advantage provided by the above described processes is that social media posts that relate to the TV program are not presented to the user during the presentation e.g. the broadcast of the TV program . The social media posts relating to the TV program are advantageously filtered out or removed from a stream of social media posts that is presented to the user . Thus the user tends not to be presented with social media posts that contain spoilers or other pertinent information relating to the TV program .

A further advantage is that social media posts that do not relate to the TV program may still be presented to the user . Thus the user may still use social networking services even though they wish to avoid spoiler information.

The social media posts that relate to the TV program are advantageously stored for future playback or information that may be used to retrieve the social media posts that relate to the TV program for future provision to a playback device is stored. Thus the extracted social media posts may be presented to the user at some future time e.g. when the user watches the TV program on a time shifted basis relative to the initial presentation of the TV program . An example method by which stored social media posts may be provided to the user is described in more detail later below with reference to . Thus when at some future time the user watches the TV program the social media associated with the TV program may be displayed to the user . Thus the relevant social media posts may advantageously be time shifted to coincide with the later consumption of the TV program .

At s one or more identifiers that identify and or can be used to identify a social media post as relating to the TV program are specified. Identifiers may for example be specified by the maker of the TV program or the provider of the TV program i.e. the content provider . Identifiers may for example be specified by an operator or user of the filtering module or by the filtering module itself. Identifiers may for example be specified by a different party i.e. other than the maker or provider of the TV program and the operator or user of the filtering module . The specified identifiers may include one or more tags keywords key terms or hashtags that relate to the TV program . The specified identifiers are any kind of metadata that is usable to e.g. by browsing or searching a stream of social media posts find or detect within that stream of social media posts those social media posts that relate to the TV program or events occurring therein. Also the specified identifiers are any kind of metadata that is usable to extract from within a stream of social media posts those social media posts that relate to the TV program or events occurring therein. Any appropriate process may be used at s to specify the one or more identifiers . In some embodiments identifiers may be specified before broadcast of the TV program e.g. by in effect guessing or estimating identifiers that may be used. However in other embodiments identifiers may be specified after or during broadcast of the TV program e.g. by selecting top trending identifiers during broadcast or discovering the most popular identifiers used after the broadcast of the TV program .

Thus at step s the filtering module acquires one or more filtering criteria which specify media content i.e. content specific filtering criteria . In some embodiments the filtering module acquires a different type of content specific filtering criteria instead of or in addition to identifiers that may be used by the filtering module to extract social media posts from the input stream.

At s scheduling or timing information for the TV program is acquired from the EPG . This scheduling information includes the start time and the end time for the upcoming presentation of the TV program . This timing information may be acquired for example by the maker of the TV program the provider of the TV program i.e. the content provider an operator or user of the filtering module the filtering module itself or a different party.

At s the specified identifiers relating to the TV program and the acquired scheduling information or timing information is sent from the respective parties that specified or acquired that information to the filtering module . The filtering module receives the timing information and identifiers relating to the TV program .

At s the content provider provides the TV program for presentation e.g. for broadcast unicast multicast etc. . The TV program may be displayed on the TV to the user . Also instead of or in addition to being displayed on the TV the TV program may be recorded e.g. by the session manager e.g. for playback at a later time.

At s concurrently with the presentation of the TV program users of the social networking service provided by the social networking service provider which may include the user that are consuming the TV program create or publish social media posts that relate to the TV program . An identifier of such a social media post indicates that that social media post relates to the TV program . A time indicator of such a social media post may indicate that that social media post was published or created between the start time and end time of the TV program .

At s the social networking service provider provides social media posts as a stream of social media posts to the filtering module . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of .

At s the filtering module filters the received stream of social media posts so as to extract from the received stream those social media posts that relate to the TV program . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of . Alternatively in some embodiments the social media posts that relate to the TV program are not extracted from the stream and instead may be identified as relating to the TV program .

At s the social media posts that have been extracted from the stream of social media posts or identified as relating to the TV program without being extracted are stored or indexed in the database . In other words in an embodiment the filtering module sends the social media posts that relate to the TV program or sends data related to those social media posts to the database for storage or indexing.

The data stored in the database for an extracted social media post is usable to ascertain a time reference e.g. a time indicator for that social media post such that that social media posts can be provided for playback by a playback device synchronously with a playback by the user of the TV program . For example the data stored in the database for an extracted social media post comprises a time reference for that social media post.

The data stored in the database for an extracted social media post may be indicative of an opinion expressed in that social media post e.g. by the creator or publisher of the social media post . The opinion expressed in the social media post may relate to any subject such as the TV program or events occurring within the TV program . This opinion information may for example be based upon social voting tools such as star ratings or flags or like buttons that allow viewers to tag social media posts. Alternatively this opinion information may be manually specified or specified by using AI based natural language processing or otherwise. As described in more detail later below with reference to during playback of social media posts the filtering module may filter social media posts depending on the opinion information such that only those social media posts whose opinion information satisfies certain criteria are presented to a user.

In some embodiments social media posts and or other information related thereto received from the social networking service provider are stored in the database e.g. by the filtering module before any extraction of social media posts or filtering of social media posts is performed. For example in some embodiments all social media posts or information related thereto received from the social media networking service provider is stored and then e.g. at some later time filtered so that only those social media posts that relate to the TV program or only information related to those social media posts that relate to the TV program remain in the database . Also for example in some embodiments all social media posts received from the social media networking service provider may be stored and then e.g. when at some later time it is indicated to the filtering module that the TV program is to be played back the filtering module may extract from the database those social media posts that relate to the TV program .

At s the social media posts that have not been extracted from the stream of social media posts which may include only those social media posts that do not relate to the TV program but may in some embodiments also include the social media posts that do relate to the TV program are sent to the social networking client . The social networking client may provide the received social media posts for consumption by the user .

Thus a further method of processing social media posts which includes the extraction of social media posts from a stream of social media posts is provided.

At some time after the start of the presentation of the TV program the user consumes the TV program e.g. a recorded version of the TV program . In other words the user begins to watch the TV program on a time shifted basis. The user is identified as consuming the time shifted TV program in any suitable way e.g. by the session manager that has recorded the TV program and that is replaying the recorded TV program for consumption by the user .

While consuming the TV program the user creates or publishes one or more social media posts related to the TV program . Because the user is consuming the TV program on a time shifted basis the user may be privy to information relating to events that occur in the TV program at some time after the current point in the playback of the TV program . Thus one or more of the user s social media posts may contain spoilers about future events within the TV program .

The filtering module receives social media posts created or published by the user concurrently with the user consuming the time shifted TV program . These social media posts may for example be received by the filtering module in response to an initial set of filtering criteria that specify that the filtering module is to receive e.g. only social media posts created or published by the user e.g. concurrently with the user s consumption of the TV program .

The filtering module filters the social media posts created or published by the user to extract from the received stream those social media posts that relate to the TV program . This may for example be performed in the same way as at s of the process of . Alternatively in some embodiments the social media posts that relate to the TV program are not extracted from the stream and instead may be identified as relating to the TV program .

The social media posts that have been extracted from the stream of social media posts or identified as relating to the TV program without being extracted are stored in the database e.g. as a separate data set to the social media posts created or published during the initial presentation of the TV program . In other words the filtering module sends the social media posts that relate to the TV program to the database .

In other embodiments instead of or in addition to storing the extracted or identified social media posts the filtering module stores indicia such as URLs pointers or other identifiers corresponding to the extracted or identified social media posts for enabling future retrieval and presentation of the extracted social media posts e.g. from a network accessible storage device database server or archive.

Also in other embodiments instead of or in addition to storing the extracted or identified social media posts or indicia related thereto the filtering module stores some function e.g. a hash of the extracted or identified social media posts or information that may be used to identify the extracted social media posts such as a time reference and creator or publisher information for enabling the distinguishing of the extracted social media posts from other social media posts e.g. in a replayed or played back stream of social media posts received from a social networking service .

The data stored in the database for an extracted social media post is usable to ascertain a time reference e.g. a time indicator for that social media post such that that social media posts can be provided for playback by a playback device synchronously with a playback by the user of the TV program . For example the data stored in the database for an extracted social media post comprises a time reference for that social media post

In some embodiments the social media posts created or published by the user concurrently with the user consuming the time shifted TV program are analysed e.g. manually or by one or more processors to determine whether or not each of those social media posts contain information relating to an event that occurs within the TV program at some time after the time in the TV program to which that social media post relates. In other words the social media posts created or published by the user concurrently with the user consuming the time shifted TV program are analysed to determine whether those posts contain spoilers . Social media posts that contain spoilers may be assigned a spoiler tag e.g. metadata that identifies that social media post as containing a spoiler .

In some embodiments all of the social media posts created or published by the user concurrently with the user consuming the time shifted TV program are assigned a spoiler tag irrespective of whether or not they contain spoilers. This advantageously avoids the performance of an analysis process for determining whether or not a social media post contains a spoiler.

A further advantage provided by the process of is that social media posts relating to certain broadcasts may be stored. These social media posts may be stored in such a way that a social media feed to a user of the social networking service is not interrupted i.e. the user may be presented with all social media posts . Thus for example social media posts that relate to an important broadcast such as an important or iconic sporting event or an event of national or international importance may be stored. The stored social media posts may provide a rich resource for research e.g. future sociological research . The social media posts may be stored for posterity.

Also the social media posts may be stored for provision to viewers of the TV program when that TV program is re broadcast. An example method by which stored social media posts may be provided to viewers is described in more detail later below with reference to . The provision of the stored social media posts when the TV program is re broadcast advantageously tends to enhance the viewing experience of the viewers of the re broadcast TV program .

An advantage provided by the assignment of such spoiler tags is that during playback of the social media posts by a playback device e.g. as described in more detail later below a user to whom the social media posts are being played back may select whether or not to play back the spoiler social media posts. In other words a user to whom the social media posts are being played back may either specify that during playback of the social media stream the social media posts that have been assigned a spoiler tag are not displayed to that user or specify that during playback of the social media stream the social media posts that have been assigned a spoiler tag are displayed to that user. Thus if a user so wishes the user may advantageously avoid being exposed to spoiler information contained within the social media posts relating to the TV program .

In some embodiments social media posts associated with an important sporting event or other important broadcast may be stored in a long term database. When that event is re broadcast the social media associated with that event may be displayed to viewers. Thus in addition to or instead of viewing contemporaneous social media posts a viewer of the re broadcast may advantageously view comments etc. from time shifted viewers i.e. viewers of an earlier broadcast of the TV program . In other words some embodiments provide one or more enhanced or alternate stream of social media comments from time shifted viewers from one or more earlier time periods synchronized with the portion of the video that the commenter was watching when the comment was entered.

In an illustrative example viewers in the year 2033 who watch a sporting event played in the year 2013 e.g. a classic sporting event might see a first live stream of contemporaneous social media posts synchronized appropriately with the game from people who were commenting while viewing the game live during a first broadcast in 2013. They would also be able to access a second stream of social media posts also synchronized appropriately with the game from people who viewed a recording or rebroadcast of the game subsequent to the first broadcast. Thus the second stream of social media posts does not include live commentary but can include social media posts from the entire time period thereafter e.g. from later in 2013 through 2033 or any selected portions or subsets of that time period. In a further illustrative example viewers in 2015 who watch a recording or rebroadcast of a classic game played in 1970 could see a stream of social media posts that have accrued over some number of years but which would only begin at or after a time when social media networking became available and thus would not include a stream from original live viewers of the game in 1970. Social media posts relating to a plurality of re broadcasts of a TV program may thus be compiled over a time period e.g. over several years or decades . Such a compilation can accrue considerable historical value. It is also noteworthy that in the foregoing illustrative example the first live stream can be reliably considered free of spoiler information because all of the social media posts in the first stream were published contemporaneously with the occurrence of the event.

Any of the features of the processes of and may be combined. A resulting process may provide any or all of the advantages provided by the processes of or

What will now be described is a process of playing back stored social media posts i.e. social media posts that may have been stored using a method described above with reference to 

At s an option for the user to view the TV program on the TV is presented to the user . For example the option to view the TV program may be displayed on the TV to the user . For example if the TV program was recorded by the user at some earlier time an option for the user to view the recording of the TV program may be presented to the user .

At s the user selects the option to view the TV program . In other words the user indicates that they wish to view the TV program . This indication that the user wishes to view the TV program is performed using any appropriate mechanism for example the user may select using a controller of the TV the TV program from a list of recorded TV programs that is displayed on the TV .

At s an indication that the user wishes to view the TV program is sent to the session manager e.g. from the TV via the set top box . This indication identifies the TV program .

The indication received by the session manager includes an instruction to the session manager to replay a recording of the TV program . In some embodiments the indication received by the session manager includes an instruction to the session manager to retrieve the TV program from a source or store of multimedia content.

At s an indication that the TV program is to be played back to the user is sent from the session manager to the filtering module e.g. via the Internet . This indication includes a start time at which playback of the TV program is to begin. In some embodiments this indication may also include one or more identifiers that were previously used by the filtering module to identify and possibly extract social media posts that related to the TV program from a stream of social media posts .

In some embodiments the filtering module may acquire an indication that the TV program is to be viewed by a user in a different way from that described above. For example in some embodiments a broadcaster e.g. a provider of the TV program may indicate to the filtering module that the TV program is to be re broadcast. Also for example the user may input into the filtering module an indication that they are about to view the TV program . Such an indication may include a start time for the re broadcasting or playback of the TV program . Also such an indication may include an instruction that the filtering module is to acquire and provide the social media posts that relate to the TV program e.g. beginning at the indicated start time .

At s the session manager provides the TV program e.g. the recording of the TV program for display to the user . The TV presents the TV program to the user .

In some embodiments for example in embodiments in which social media posts that relate to the TV program have been stored in the database the filtering module retrieves from the database those social media posts that relate to the TV program . This retrieval process may be performed using the identifiers relating to the TV program that may have been previously used by the filtering module to identify the social media posts that relate to the TV program . For example the filtering module retrieve from the database those social media posts whose identifier s match one or more of the previously used identifiers . In other words the filtering module may filter the database using the identifiers relating to the TV program . In some embodiments only social media posts relating to the TV program have been stored in the database . In such embodiments all social media posts within the database may be acquired from the database .

In other embodiments for example in embodiments in which indicia or other information for identifying those social media posts that relate to the TV program were stored the filtering module uses those stored indicia or other information to acquire the social media posts that relate to the TV program .

For example in some embodiments the filtering module receives a further stream or set of social media posts . This further stream of social media posts may include all of those social media posts that were provided by the social networking service provider during the earlier broadcast of the TV program . The further stream of social media posts may be provided by the social networking service provider . For example the further stream may be a re transmission of those social media posts provided at s and s. Alternatively the further stream may be provided to the filtering module by a different entity. The further stream may be received by the filtering module in response to a request i.e. a request that the further stream is sent to the filtering module being sent to the entity that provides the further stream for example by the filtering module or the session manager . The filtering module may then use the indicia or other information stored within the database to identify those social media posts within the further stream that relate to the TV program .

For example in some embodiments a hash or some other function of each social media post that relates to the TV program is stored in the database . Upon receiving the further stream the filtering module determines a hash of each of the social media posts within the further stream. The filtering module then compares the hashes of the social media posts of the further stream with the stored hashes. The filtering module identifies as relating to the TV program each social media post within the further stream whose hash matches a hash stored in the database and thereby acquires the social media posts relating to the TV program .

In another embodiment for each social media post that relates to the TV program an information set is stored in the database . Preferably an information set for a social media post includes at least a unique identifier of the publisher and a time indicator of that social media post. Upon receiving the further stream the filtering module determines the information set of each of the social media posts within the further stream. The filtering module then compares the information sets of the social media posts of the further stream with the stored information sets. The filtering module identifies as relating to the TV program each social media post within the further stream whose information set matches an information set stored in the database and thereby acquires the social media posts relating to the TV program .

In embodiments in which a spoiler tag has been assigned to some or all of the extracted social media posts the user to whom the social media posts are to be played back may select whether or not to play back the spoiler social media posts. In embodiments in which the user selects not to have spoiler information e.g. the social media posts that have been assigned a spoiler tag displayed to them the social media posts that have been assigned a spoiler tag are not acquired by the filtering module e.g. the filtering module may filter out these posts using the spoiler tag as a filtering criteria . In embodiments in which the user selects to have spoiler information e.g. the social media posts that have been assigned a spoiler tag displayed to them the social media posts that have been assigned a spoiler tag are acquired by the filtering module e.g. the filtering module performs no filtering of the social media posts using the spoiler tag as a filtering criteria .

In embodiments in which the data stored for a social media post specifies an opinion with respect to a certain subject expressed within that social media post the user to whom the social media posts are to be played back may select only to have displayed to them the social media posts whose corresponding opinion information fulfils certain criteria e.g. user specified criteria . For example the user may specify criteria or a user preferences that the filtering module can implement so as to screen from the user e.g. filter out and not display to the user those social media posts that express opinions that oppose the user s opinions.

In a further embodiment affinity information can be used in addition to opinion information or as a proxy for opinion information. In an illustrative example a football rivalry may exist between a Philadelphia team and a Dallas team and users are able to indicate their affinity for a team e.g. by creating a corresponding affinity indication in a user profile by liking the team and so forth . Using such affinity information a fan of the Philadelphia team viewing a game between Philadelphia and Dallas could choose to filter the social media posts so as to view only social media posts that are highly rated by fellow fans of the Philadelphia team. Another fan of the Philadelphia team desiring to be more inclusive might still desire to exclude social media posts that are determined to be biased against the Philadelphia team. An indication of bias can be automatically determined for example if a particular social media post is rated positive by fans of the Dallas team and is also rated negative by fans of the Philadelphia team.

In a still further embodiment a degree of protection is provided against false or misleading affinity information. For example malicious or spiteful individuals sometimes known as trolls might deliberately misidentify themselves or misrepresent their affinities in order to post social media posts that will be viewed by other users who have a corresponding truthful affinity and that would tend to provoke annoy or harass such users. In an illustrative example a fan of the Dallas team might misrepresent his affinity information falsely stating himself to be a fan of the Philadelphia team for the purpose of causing his deliberately provocative social media posts to be viewed by Philadelphia fans. Thus in a further embodiment an AI system or social voting reporting or a combination of both can be used by the filtering module for detecting such misrepresentations so as to provide greater accuracy in filtering social media posts published by individuals associated with false or misleading affinity information.

At s the social media posts that are acquired by the filtering module are sent to the social networking client . The provision to the social networking client of the social media posts that relate to the TV program is such that a social media post is provided at the time within the TV program indicated by the time indicator of that social media post . Thus a social media post is provided to the user so that it coincides with the portion of the TV program to which that social media post relates. In other words the social media posts relating to the TV program are presented to the user synchronously with the playback of the TV program . For example if a social media post was created or published in relation to the point within the TV program and the time indicator of that social media post indicated a time t t then that social media post is provided to the social networking client when the point of the TV program is displayed on the TV to the user i.e. at t twithin the TV program . The filtering module may use an indication of the start time of the TV program that may have been sent to the filtering module at s to determine when a social media post should be sent to the social networking client .

At s the social networking client presents the received social media posts for consumption by the user e.g. as those posts are received by the social networking client .

Thus a method of processing social media posts which includes the playing back social media posts that have been stored in the database is provided.

An advantage provided by the process of playing back social media posts that have been stored in the database is that social media posts that relate to the TV program are time shifted and are displayed to the user when the user watches the TV program . Thus the user s viewing experience tends to be enhanced by his consumption of social media that was produced during an earlier broadcast of the TV program . Also a social media post is provided to the user so that its display coincides with the display of the portion of the TV program to which that social media post relates.

Playback of the TV program by the user may be paused fast forwarded rewound etc. Playback of the stream of social media posts that relate to the TV program may be automatically paused fast forwarded rewound etc. in a corresponding fashion.

The above described methods and apparatus may apply to TV programs that are replayed a relatively long time after an original broadcast e.g. days months or years . Also the above described methods and apparatus can be applied to TV programs that are replayed a relatively short time e.g. seconds minutes or hours after an original broadcast for example a TV program that is watched nearly live but with a relatively brief delay such as by using a DVR feature for pausing a program as it is received e.g. live linear or streamed program content .

Thus for example the user may pause a live broadcast for a few minutes or seconds and later resume viewing the broadcast in a time shifted manner with the few minutes or seconds of delay. The social media stream being consumed by the user is automatically delayed by the same length of time as the broadcast such that the broadcast and the social media stream remain synchronized. In an illustrative example a user decides to pause a live broadcast program for five minutes to take a brief break and then resumes viewing with a five minute delay. If the user is viewing social media posts while watching the program embodiments are able to prevent the social media posts from being viewed out of synchronization with the viewing experience thus reducing the potential for unwanted spoiler information to be viewed by the user . For example embodiments are able to prevent the undesirable situation in which the user who paused for five minutes while viewing a sporting event then receives social media posts from other viewers who are discussing live events that will not be seen by the user until five minutes into the future i.e. spoiler information for events that the user has not yet seen. Embodiments are able to prevent such occurrences assuring the user that social media posts being viewed will remain synchronized with the event and free of spoilers.

In some embodiments the filtering module includes a feature that is configured to automatically screen social media posts for spoilers e.g. information relating to events that occur in the TV program sometime after the time indicated by the time indicator of that social media post . This screening can be accomplished manually or by using AI based natural language processing or by social voting or any conventional technique or combination of these. Social media posts that are determined to contain spoilers may be removed from the feed provided for consumption by the user .

Thus in some embodiments one or more of the following streams of social media posts are provided to the user i a stream of original comments corresponding to a current broadcast of the TV program ii a stream of comments from time shifted viewers synchronized with the portion of the TV program that they were watching when the comment was published iii a stream of comments from i and or ii that are filtered e.g. automatically screened for spoilers for the benefit of first time viewers who may be time shifted.

It will be understood that although a number of the examples set forth above have concerned sporting events the TV program may be of any genre for example a history documentary a news broadcast an entertainment program a sports program etc. Embodiments relating for example to spoiler tags or spoiler information are applicable to any of the above types of content e.g. any content in which it is undesirable to reveal information on an untimely basis such as sports reality television talent contests cooking competitions comedy dramatic presentations and the like.
