The present disclosure relates generally to mobile device access and security and more particularly to wirelessly paired devices and methods of securing device access.

Mobile devices include locking mechanisms that lock the device or user interface to prevent unauthorized access. Many mobile devices may be paired to other devices using wireless technologies to provide additional or enhanced features and capabilities. Some pair able devices may be wearable devices in the sense that these devices may be worn by a user as a fashion accessory such as jewelry an article of clothing a portion of an article of clothing etc. However adding mobile devices to a user s repertoire of devices increases security and access concerns.

Briefly the disclosed embodiments provide for a mechanism to unlock a primary device using a paired wearable device. The primary device may be a smartphone tablet or other computing device etc. The wearable device is paired to the primary device and stores a certificate for granting access to the primary device. If the wearable device is not worn the certificate is eradicated so that the device may no longer be used to access the primary device unless a subsequent security procedure is followed to generate a new certificate.

The present disclosure provides a method of operation that includes detecting by a wearable device that the wearable device is being worn receiving by the wearable device a certificate from a primary device over a secure wireless link where the wearable device is paired to the primary device using the secure wireless link storing the certificate in memory of the wearable device and sending the certificate over the secure wireless link to the primary device to unlock the primary device. The method may further include detecting that the wearable device is no longer being worn and eradicating the certificate from memory of the wearable device in response to detecting that the wearable device is no longer being worn. In some embodiments the method may also include detecting that the secure wireless link between the wearable device and the primary device is disconnected and eradicating the certificate from memory of the wearable device in response to detecting that the secure wireless link between the wearable device and the primary device is disconnected.

The present disclosure also provides a wearable device. In one embodiment a wearable device includes a wireless transceiver operative to pair with a primary device to establish a secure wireless link a wear sensor and wear detection logic operatively coupled to the wear sensor. The wear detection logic is operative to detect that the wearable device is being worn by using the wear sensor. The wearable device also includes certificate handler that is operatively coupled to the wear detection logic. The certificate handler is operative to receive a certificate from a primary device over a secure wireless link when the wearable device is paired to the primary device using the secure wireless link and to send the certificate over the secure wireless link to the primary device to unlock the primary device. The wearable device also includes memory that is operatively coupled to the certificate handler and that is operative to store the certificate.

The wear detection logic is also operative to detect that the wearable device is no longer being worn. In that case the certificate handler will eradicate the certificate from the memory of the wearable device in response to detecting that the wearable device is no longer being worn.

The present disclosure also provides a system that includes the wearable device and a primary device. In one embodiment the primary device includes a primary device wireless transceiver that is operative to communicate with the wearable device wireless transceiver to establish the secure wireless link and a certificate generator that is operatively coupled to the primary device wireless transceiver. The primary device also includes primary device lock logic that is operatively coupled to the primary device wireless transceiver. The primary device lock logic is operative to unlock the primary device in response to receiving the certificate from the wearable device.

Turning now to the drawings illustrates various primary devices that may be paired with a secondary wearable device using a wireless link . The primary devices may be for example a personal digital assistant PDA a tablet or e book reader a mobile telephone a laptop computer personal computer or some other device that has a wireless link capability. The secondary wearable device may be for example a smart watch . Any one of the example primary devices may establish a wireless link with the secondary device such that the primary device and the secondary device are paired devices. The wireless link may be established using for example WiFi Bluetooth or some other suitable wireless technology. The wireless link is a secure wireless link in accordance with the embodiments.

Any one of the primary devices may also be capable of establishing a corresponding network connection to a network using any suitable wireless or wire line connection technology and may connect to any of various wide area networks WAN wireless local area networks WLAN and or to the Internet.

After establishment of the secure wireless link between the primary device and secondary device the secondary device may be used to unlock the primary device a using the wireless link as illustrated in the example of . The locked primary device may display a password entry field on the display upon the primary device being locked or in response to the user attempting to access the primary device . The locked primary device may also display an icon or some other indication that informs the user that the primary device is locked. However in other embodiments the unlocking procedure will occur as a background procedure and no particular indications need be provided to the user.

In some embodiments the password entry field may only be displayed when the user attempts to access the locked primary device . In this case the locked primary device may send an unlock request to the secondary device over the wireless link . Alternatively in other embodiments the secondary device may detect that it is in proximity to the locked primary device a by using a proximity sensor or NFC technology. In any of the various embodiments the secondary device sends a certificate to the locked primary device either in response to an unlock request or in response to proximity detection. The primary device will receive the certificate over the wireless link and will authenticate the certificate . If the certificate is found valid the primary device will become unlocked and will appear for example as the unlocked primary device shown on the rightmost side of . That is upon being unlocked the display will allow the user to access one or more application icons or take some other action such as making a phone call etc. In some embodiments unlocking the primary device may be related to initiating an application on the primary device where the application enables access to the primary device and other applications. In one example embodiment the primary device may be unlocked by activating a voice recognition application of the primary device .

In various embodiments the secondary device may either receive an unlock request from the locked primary device or may detect that it is in proximity to the locked primary device by using NFC technology as was discussed above. In some embodiments the secondary device may provide a user prompt on a display of the secondary device asking the user whether the primary device should be unlocked. The user may then select yes to unlock the primary device or no to maintain the primary device in a locked state.

The secondary device may include various features in the various embodiments some examples of which are shown in . For example the secondary device may include a scroll feature either on the display as a touch screen feature or by way of having a touch sensor control positioned adjacent to the display . An example of such a touch sensor control is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 770 259 filed Feb. 19 2013 entitled Sensing Strip For Providing Touch and Gesture Controls which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The secondary device may also include a set of control buttons such that the user may select a yes or no response to the inquiry of the user prompt or take other actions with respect to the secondary device .

In an unlocking method of operation in accordance with one embodiment for example if the secondary device displays the user prompt the user may respond by selecting yes. In response to this selection input the secondary device will send certificate to the primary device over the wireless link . The locked primary device will receive the certificate verify its authenticity and unlock the primary device which may then appear as the unlocked primary device shown on the rightmost side of .

In accordance with the embodiments the secondary device stores the certificate and eradicates the certificate from memory under certain conditions. For example the secondary device must be worn by the user by securing the wrist strap to the user s wrist. That is in order for the secondary device to maintain a stored copy of the certificate the secondary device must be worn by the user either at the time of pairing to the primary device or immediately subsequent to pairing the devices. In accordance with the embodiments the certificate will be eradicated from memory of the secondary device if either the secondary device is no longer worn by the user or if the wireless link is broken such that it would need to be re established. Thus if the user were to wear the secondary device but move outside a radio coverage range of the wireless link such that the wireless link is disconnected then the secondary device will automatically eradicate the certificate from memory. Also if the user were to remove the secondary device from the user s wrist by disengaging the wrist strap and removing the secondary device from contact with the user s wrist then the certificate will also be eradicated from memory of the secondary device . Therefore another party who obtained access to the secondary device would not be able to use it to unlock the primary device because the certificate would be permanently eradicated from memory of the secondary device in accordance with the embodiments. In some embodiments the primary device will also eradicate the certificate from memory of the primary device in response to either a notification message from the secondary device detecting that the wireless link with the secondary device is disconnected or both conditions.

The memory is a non volatile non transitory memory and stores a copy of the certificate provided that the wear sensor indicates that the secondary device is being worn by the user and that a wireless link with the primary device using peer to peer transceiver is maintained intact. The memory may also store executable instructions or executable code such as executable code C corresponding to certificate handler and executable code C corresponding to wear detection logic .

The processor is also operative to execute a wireless protocol stack which may also have corresponding executable code stored in memory . The wireless protocol stack operates in conjunction with the peer to peer transceiver and is compatible with the primary device and may be for example a Bluetooth Wireless USB ZigBee Wi Fi or other wireless protocol stack etc.

Various methods of operation in accordance with the embodiments are performed by the certificate handler and the wear detection logic both of which are operatively coupled to the wireless protocol stack . The operative coupling may be achieved by software coupling that allows information flow and command and control signals between the certificate handler the wear detection logic the wireless protocol stack and in some embodiments other applications . The software coupling between the components may in some embodiments utilize libraries or APIs contained within a libraries layer of the wireless protocol stack or elsewhere such as within an operating system.

The wear detection logic operates in conjunction with the wear sensor to detect when the user is wearing the secondary device and also to detect when the secondary device is not being worn. In some embodiments the wear sensor may be a capacitive sensor such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 776 103 filed Feb. 25 2013 entitled Capacitive Sensor which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. In some embodiments the wear sensor and wear detection logic may operate as described in the aforementioned U.S. Patent Application and also as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 776 099 filed Feb. 25 2013 entitled Wearable Device With Capacitive Sensor and Method of Operation Therefor which is also hereby incorporated by reference herein.

One method of operation that may be understood with respect to the example primary device and the example secondary device is shown in and begins in operation block where the primary device and secondary device are paired using a wireless link. That is the peer to peer transceiver of the primary device establishes a wireless link with the peer to peer transceiver of the secondary device . The establishment of the wireless link is controlled by the corresponding wireless protocol stack primary device and wireless protocol stack of secondary device . In operation block the wear detection logic obtains data from the wear sensor to determine whether the secondary device is being worn by the user.

In accordance with the embodiments subsequent to establishment of the secure wireless link and as shown in operation block the certificate generator will generate a certificate and store it in the memory . The certificate generator will also communicate with the wireless protocol stack to transmit the certificate two the secondary device .

The secondary device will receive a copy of the certificate by way of the wireless protocol stack and the certificate handler will store the certificate in memory . In operation block under circumstances where the primary device is to be unlocked the certificate handler retrieves the copy of the certificate from memory and sends it to the primary device by way of the wireless protocol stack . On the primary device the wireless protocol stack receives the copy of the certificate and the certificate generator examines the received certificate to authenticate it against the certificate stored in memory . If the received certificate copy matches the certificate stored in memory the received certificate copy and also therefore the secondary device may thus be considered authenticated and the certificate generator may send the appropriate control signal to the device lock logic to cause the primary device to be unlocked.

The certificate generator will only receive the certificate from the secondary device if the wear detection logic determines that the secondary device is being worn by the user and if the wireless link to the primary device is maintained. In some embodiments which are discussed herein below the secondary device may attempt to reestablish the wireless link with the primary device in order to send the certificate copy. The certificate handler may determine the status of the wireless link by communicating with the wireless protocol stack to check whether the wireless link has been disconnected or not. The certificate handler will also communication with the wear detection logic and will receive an indication from the wear detection logic when the secondary device is removed from the user s wrist and is not being worn. If the secondary device is determined to be not removed and not worn by the user then the certificate handler will eradicate the certificate from the memory . In some embodiments the certificate handler will also eradicate the certificate if the wireless link is disconnected. The eradication of the certificate may be performed in any number of various ways that are understood by those of ordinary skill. For example in some embodiments the memory location at which the certificate was stored within memory may be overwritten explicitly with a sequence of bits such that the certificate is unrecoverable from memory . The sequence of bits may be any random sequence that constitutes noise or garbage and that thus serves to eradicate the certificate and render it unrecoverable. The method of operation illustrated in ends with the transmission of the certificate from the secondary device to the primary device at which point the primary device or some application of the primary device may be unlocked for user access.

Further details of operation of the primary device are illustrated in . In operation block the primary device establishes a secure wireless link with the secondary device . In operation block the certificate generator generates the certificate and stores to certificate in memory . In some embodiments the primary device may display a prompt on display requiring the user to enter the primary device unlock password prior to generation of the certificate . In that case the certificate will not be generated in the absence of the primary device unlock password and the certificate generator will eventually timeout. In that case the primary device will only be capable of being unlocked by manual entry of the primary device unlock password. That is the secondary device will not be in possession of the certificate unless the method of operation is reinitiated. In operation block the certificate generator communicates with the wireless protocol stack and sends the certificate to the secondary device using the secure wireless link over peer to peer transceiver . The method of operation then ends.

Another method of operation of the primary device in one embodiment is illustrated in . In operation block the device lock logic may detect that the user is attempting to access the primary device . In response to the detected access attempt the device lock logic may communicate with the wireless protocol stack to transmit an access request to the secondary device over the wireless link. In response to receiving the access request the certificate handler on the secondary device communicates with the wireless protocol stack to receive the access request from the primary device . In response to receiving the access request the certificate handler communicates with the certificate handler which retrieves the copy of the certificate from memory and transmits the certificate over the wireless link to the primary device . As shown in operation block the primary device receives the copy of certificate from the secondary device . In decision block the certificate generator examines the received copy of the certificate to ensure that it matches with the certificate stored in memory . If the certificate generator determines that the certificate is authentic then the certificate generate greater communicates with the device lock logic to unlock the primary device . However if the certificate is found to be invalid in decision block then the method of operation proceeds to operation block and access is denied. The device lock logic may communicate with the display in some embodiments to display an access denied message as shown in operation block . However in other embodiments no message will be displayed and the device lock logic will only continue to maintain the primary device in a locked state. The method of operation then ends as shown.

On the secondary device in response to the received notification or request the secondary device will prompt the user to input a second user defined alphanumeric code by way of the user interface . In operation block the second alphanumeric code is stored in memory by the secondary device and is sent to the primary device which receives and stores it in memory . The method of operation described above with respect to is based on the primary device and the secondary device having an established secure wireless link and being within a relatively close proximity such that the user may enter both alphanumeric codes within a time out period of the primary device .

Subsequent to the initialization of the two step authentication process of the primary device is unlocked by following a similar method of operation. However rather than requiring the user to input the second alphanumeric code in the secondary device as in operation block the secondary device automatically retrieves the second alphanumeric code from memory and sends it to the primary device . The primary device receives the second alphanumeric code in operation block and then compares it with the version stored in memory . If the two versions of the second alphanumeric code match and assuming the first alphanumeric code entered by way of user interface is correct the primary device will be unlocked.

A method of operation of a secondary device in accordance with another embodiment is shown in . In operation block the secondary device receives an unlock request or notification from the primary device . This may occur in response to the user attempting to access and use the primary device user interface . That is in some embodiments the primary device may go into a sleep mode or some other low power mode where the user may wake up the primary device by interacting with the display or with the user interface . In that case the primary device will send the unlock request or notification to the secondary device in response to being woken up. In other embodiments the secondary device may detect the presence of the primary device for example using NFC and may initiate the method of operation. In yet another embodiment the primary device may detect the presence of the secondary device for example using NFC and may send the unlock request to the secondary device in response to detecting the proximity of the secondary device .

In any of the above example embodiments the secondary device will proceed to send the certificate to the primary device if the criteria of decision block and decision block are met. If the secondary device is worn in decision block the method of operation proceeds to decision block and checks the status of the wireless link. In operation block if the wireless link is present in decision block then a copy of the certificate is sent to the primary device .

If at any time the secondary device is removed from the user s wrist and is no longer worn in decision block the certificate is eradicated from memory as shown in operation block and the method of operation ends. That is the secondary device can no longer be used to unlock the primary device until a new certificate is generated using one of the methods of operation described previously above. However in the embodiment of if the wireless link is found to be disconnected in decision block the certificate is not eradicated from memory. Instead the secondary device attempts to establish another wireless link with the primary device as shown in operation block . If the wireless link is successfully established in operation block then a copy of certificate is sent to the primary device in operation block and the method of operation ends. In some embodiments the primary device may display a prompt on display requiring the user to enter the primary device unlock password prior to reestablishing the wireless link. In that case the wireless link will not be allowed to be established in the absence of the primary device unlock password. A timeout procedure may be used in operation block such that if the wireless link cannot be established with the primary device within a predetermined timeout period the method of operation also terminates.

The flowchart of shows a method of operation of a secondary device using the wear sensor and wear detection logic in accordance with an embodiment. The method of operation begins and in operation block the certificate handler communicates with the wear detection logic to monitor the wear sensor . In decision block if the secondary device is being worn as determined by the wear detection logic monitoring continues in operation block . However if the wear detection logic notifies the certificate handler that the secondary device is no longer being worn then the certificate handler eradicates the certificate from memory as shown in operation block and the method of operation ends. In some embodiments the certificate handler will also send a notification to the primary device by way of the wireless protocol stack and over the wireless link to notify the primary device that the secondary device is no longer being worn. In response to the notification message from the secondary device the certificate generator may eradicate the certificate stored in memory . In some embodiments the certificate generator of the primary device may also eradicate the certificate if the wireless protocol stack provides an indication that the wireless link with the secondary device has been disconnected. In that case the user will have to manually enter a pin into the display to unlock the primary device until the certificate generation methods described above is again invoked between the primary device and the secondary device.

While various embodiments have been illustrated and described it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
