title: Methods and devices for space-time multi-plane optical networks
abstract: Scalability and energy efficiency are key issues in data centers imposing tight constraints on the networking infrastructure connecting the servers. Optical interconnection mitigates electronic limitations but the additional flexibility offered by WDM and datarate across a data center interconnection network requires architectural design, photonic technologies, and operating strategies be selected and optimized to meet power consumption requirements. Multi-plane architectures based upon space-wavelength domain architectures have been proposed to overcome scalability limitations. It would be beneficial to extend space and time switching domains with the wavelength domain for additional capacity to increase throughput as well as providing same electro-optic interface. Accordingly, the inventors have established space-time domain interconnection network architectures with wavelength domain overlay overcoming power consumption issues, especially at low utilization, by exploiting all-optical implementations with active elements which act simultaneously as a switch and an amplifier, and the possibility to remain in an idle state when unused.

This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61 657 067 filed Jun. 8 2012 entitled Method and Apparatus For Energy Efficient Implementation of Scalable Optical Interconnection Architectures the entire contents of which are included by reference.

This invention relates to optical interconnection networks and more particularly to optical interconnection networks exploiting space time wavelength domains with reduced power consumption.

Data centers are facilities that store and distribute the data on the Internet which with an estimated 100 billion plus web pages on over 100 million websites means they contain a lot of data. With almost two billion users accessing these websites including a growing amount of high bandwidth video the volume of data being uploaded and downloaded every second on the Internet is massive. At present the compound annual growth rate CAGR for global IP traffic between users is between 40 based upon Cisco s analysis see http www.cisco.com en US solutions collateral ns341 ns525 ns537 ns705 ns827 white paper c11 481360 ns827 Networking Solutions White Paper.html and 50 based upon the University of Minnesota s Minnesota Internet Traffic Studies MINTS analysis. By 2016 this user traffic is expected to exceed 100 exabytes per month over 100 000 000 terabytes per month or over 42 000 gigabytes per second. However peak demand will be considerably higher with projections of over 600 million users streaming Internet high definition video simultaneously at peak times.

All of this data will flow to and from users via data centers and accordingly between data centers and within data centers so that these IP traffic flows must be multiplied many times to establish the total IP traffic flows. Data centers are filled with tall racks of electronics surrounded by cable racks where data is typically stored on big fast hard drives. Servers are computers that take requests and move the data using fast switches to access the right hard drives. Routers connect the servers to the Internet. At the same time as applications such as cloud computing increase computing platforms are no longer stand alone systems but homogenous interconnected computing infrastructures hosted in massive data centers known as warehouse scale computers WSC which provide ubiquitous interconnected platforms as a shared resource for many distributed services with requirements that are different to the traditional racks servers of data centers.

At the same time as requiring a cost effective yet scalable way of interconnecting data centers and WSCs internally and to each other most datacenter and WSC applications are provided free of charge such that the operators of this infrastructure are faced with the challenge of meeting exponentially increasing demands for bandwidth without dramatically increasing the cost and power of their infrastructure. Further consumers expectations of download upload speeds and latency in accessing content provide additional pressure.

As if these issues were not enough the required growth in volumes of data handled reduced latency increased speed and reduced end user cost are being jeopardized by the current architectural design trend for such data centers to be built in a modular manner exploiting low cost commodity servers rather than expensive high end servers see for example Barroso et al in Web Search for a Planet The Google Cluster Architecture IEEE Micro Vol. 23 pp. 22 28 and Greenberg et al in Towards a Next Generation Data Center Architecture Scalability and Commoditization Proc. ACM Workshop on Programmable Routers for Extensible Services of Tomorrow PRESTO08 pp. 57 62 . Whilst this approach allows for tasks to be parallelized and a basic predictable performance to be delivered to users this performance is typically well below the peak performance of the servers see for example Barroso et al in The Case for Energy Proportional Computing Computer Vol. 40 pp. 33 37 and average approximately 20 30 .

However whilst server and data center sizes are increasing the power being drained by these servers and data centers is growing even faster. Whilst computational performance improvements increase approximately 200 every 2 years energy efficiency only improves at present at approximately 100 every 2 years. Accordingly the overall power consumption of each server is increasing at approximately 20 per annum see for example Brill in The Invisible Crisis in the Data Center The Economic Meltdown of Moore s Law White Paper Uptime Institute 2007 and Humphreys et al in The Impact of Power and Cooling on Data Center Infrastructure International Data Group Market Research Document 201722 2006 . In fact the acquisition cost of a server is now lower than the operational cost due to its energy consumption see for example Brill and Pepeljugoski et al in Towards Exaflop Servers and Supercomputers The Roadmap for Lower Power and Higher Density Optical Interconnects Proc. 36Eur. Conf. on Optical Communication 2010 pp. 1 14 . Koomey in Growth in Data Center Electricity use 2005 to 2010 Analytics Press 2011 http www.analyticspress.com datacenters.html estimated that electricity consumption in global data centers in 2010 accounted for between 1.1 and 1.5 of total electricity use globally and between 1.7 and 2.2 for the US. At 300 TWh year consumption and 50 generation provisioning efficiency this represents approximately 600 TWhr of generated electricity.

Accordingly scalability and energy efficiency have become key issues in data centers and are imposing tight constraints on the networking infrastructure connecting the numerous servers. Statistics report that about 10 20 of the equipment budget see for example Greenberg and about 5 of the power consumption in data centers is due to the networking infrastructure see for example Energy Star Program Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency US Environmental Protection Agency 2007 Pelle et al in Understanding and Abstracting Total Data Center Power Proc. Workshop on Energy Efficient Design 2009 and Koomey. When taken in absolute terms this amount of power consumed by the networking infrastructure is non trivial representing globally the output of several tens of 1000 MW power stations and is destined to grow with the continued scaling of data centers in terms of capacity number of servers reduced latency and increased access transmissions speeds.

As such this scalability with respect to the number of interconnected servers as well as with the inter server transmission data rate and the overall power consumption are stretching the limits of today s interconnection networks based on electronics leading to optical photonic interconnection techniques being exploited see for example Miller in Device Requirements for Optical Interconnects to Silicon Chips Proc. IEEE Vol. 97 pp. 1166 1185 . The challenge to be addressed with any interconnection solution is to interconnect a large number of servers according to dynamically changing communication patterns so that a large amount of bandwidth can be offered when and where required. This requires the design of high throughput and scalable architectures for the interconnection networks with an energy consumption limited and proportional to the utilization of the network see for example Barroso Soteriou et al in Exploring the Design Space of Self Regulating Power Aware On Off Interconnection Networks IEEE Trans. Parallel Distrib. Syst. Vol. 18 pp. 393 408 and D. Abts et al in Energy Proportional Data Center Networks Proc. 37th Ann. Int. Symp. Computer Architecture 2010 pp 0.338 347 .

Accordingly the introduction of optical solutions into interconnection networks has been proposed to mitigate the issues related to electronic limitations in a similar manner as optical solutions have already mitigated limitations in high data rate long haul transmission fanout in Fiber to the Home FTTH applications and are addressing evolving 40 Gb s and 100 Gb s point to point communications. Optical solutions offer the advantage of offering large bandwidth with low attenuation and crosstalk making it suitable for communications i.e. the exchange of data packets between servers see for example Farrington et al in HELIOS A Hybrid Electrical Optical Switch Architecture for Modular Data Centers Comput. Commun. Rev. Vol. 40 pp. 339 350 Cho et al in Power Comparison between High Speed Electrical and Optical Interconnects for Interchip Communications J. Lightwave Technol. Vol. 22 pp. 2021 2033 Benner in Cost Effective Optics Enabling the Exascale Roadmap 17IEEE Sym. High Performance Interconnects 2009 pp. 133 137 Miller in Rationale and Challenges for Optical Interconnects to Electronic Chips Proc. IEEE Vol. 88 pp. 728 749 and Chen et al Exploring the Design Space of Power Aware Opto Electronic Networked Systems Proc. Int. Sym. High Performance Computer Architecture 2005 pp. 120 131 .

Due in part from additional flexibility wavelength division multiplexing as well as datarate across the typical link lengths within a data center interconnection networks based on photonics require that the architectural design the selection of photonic technologies and the operating strategies be selected and or optimized in order to meet the requirements of power consumption see for example Miller Cho Benner Chen and Tucker in Green Optical Communications Part II Energy Limitations in Networks IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quantum Electron. Vol. 17 pp. 261 274 and The Role of Optics and Electronics in High Capacity Routers J. Lightwave Technol. Vol. 24 pp. 4655 4673 and scalability see for example Farrington and Bonetto et al in The Role of Arrayed Waveguide Gratings in Energy Efficient Optical Switching Architectures Optical Fiber Communications 2010 Paper OWY4 that are imposed by the current growth trend in data centers see for example Pepeljugoski.

In many architectural designs in order to overcome the scalability limitations multi plane architectures have been proposed such as those based upon space wavelength domain architectures see for example Gaudino in Can Simple Optical Switching Fabrics Scale to Terabit per second Switch Capacities J. Opt. Comm. Net. Vol. 1 pp. B56 B69 Raponi et al in Two Step Scheduling Framework for Space Wavelength Modular Optical Interconnection Networks IET Commun. Vol. 14 pp. 2155 2165 and Liboiron Ladouceur et al in Energy Efficient Design of a Scalable optical Multiplane Interconnection Architecture IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quantum Electron. Vol. 17 pp. 377 383 hereinafter Liboiron1 .

Typically multi plane architectures are organized based upon cards each one with multiple ports and fit well the modular architecture paradigm for data centers see for example Farrington. The control of the network is delegated to a Two Step Scheduler TSS see for example Raponi. The TSS addresses the problem of scheduling packet transmission by splitting the problem into two steps leading to a reduction of the problem complexity in each step thereby leading to a reduction in the latency experienced by the incoming packets in large size networks when compared to those controlled by a single step scheduler. Further the TSS approach allows for the parallelization of the scheduling operations leading to faster computation and higher scalability.

It would be beneficial to extend such multi plane concepts to exploit space and time switching domains for the basic infrastructure with the addition of the wavelength domain to provide additional capacity to increase the throughput whilst maintaining TSS based control. It would be further beneficial for each port of the interconnection network to exploit the same electro optic interface leading to a simplification in implementation when compared with architectures that exploit wavelength dependent ports see for example Raponi and Liboiron1. Accordingly the inventors have established space time domain interconnection network architectures with wavelength domain overlay which overcomes prior art power consumption issues especially at low levels of utilization by exploiting an all optical implementation using self enabling semiconductor optical amplifiers SE SOAs . Such SE SOAs offer the ability to act simultaneously as a switch and an amplifier and the possibility to remain in an idle state when unused.

Within many of the architectures and implementations for optical interconnection networks space switching plays a central role either discretely single plane architecture or in conjunction with time and or wavelength switching multi plane architectures such as described by Liboiron Ladouceur et al in Liboiron1 and A Scalable Space Time Multi Plane Optical Interconnection Network using Energy Efficient Enabling Technologies J. of Opt. Comm. and Netw. Vol. 6 pp. A1 A11 hereinafter Liboiron2 . Space switches allow multiple packets to be routed from any input ports to any output ports along different paths of the interconnection network and can be realized by exploiting optical gating elements as well as optical switching elements. An optical gating element may be controlled to either enable or block the passage of the optical packets. Previously proposed implementations of optical space switches were based on a single type of element either a switching element such as the microring resonator see for example Poon et al in Cascaded Microresonator Based Matrix Switch for Silicon On Chip Optical Interconnection Proc. IEEE Vol. 97 pp. 1216 1238 and Bianco et al in Optical Interconnection Networks based on Microring Resonators Int. Conf. Comm. 2010 pp. 1 5 or a gating element such as an SOA see for example Wonfor et al in Large Port Count High Speed Optical Switch Fabric for use within Datacenters J. Opt. Comm. and Netw. Vol. 3 pp. A32 A39 and Castoldi et al in Energy Efficient Switching in Optical Interconnection Networks Int. Conf. Transparent Opt. Netw. 2011 pp. 1 4 . However both microrings and SOAs have drawbacks. Microrings are characterized by small footprint integrability in CMOS technology and low power consumption they suffer from differential loss between cross and bar states and intrinsic narrowband operation. In contrast whilst SOAs are mature do not suffer path dependent impairments have fast switching time are integrable and their inherent amplification characteristic allows operation as switch and amplifier they suffer from high power consumption.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to exploit SOAs acting as switch and amplifier in combination with other optical elements in order to provide improved power efficient modulator gates such that the overall power consumption of proposed heterogeneous space switches according to embodiments of the invention is reduced with respect to a space switch based solely on SOAs.

Optical communication systems may exploit single mode and multi mode based propagation and both have seen widespread deployment to address a wide range of applications from short haul card card interconnect through to long haul and ultra long haul networks exploiting time division multiplexing TDM to encode multiple communication sessions to a single channel. Multimode optical fiber networks may exploit limited use of the inherent frequency parallelism available through wavelength division multiplexing WDM to overlay several channels onto a single physical fiber these deployments have been typically limited to bidirectional or unidirectional transmission on different wavelength bands e.g. 850 nm and 1300 nm. However WDM within single mode optical fiber links has led to 8 16 32 40 48 64 and 80 channel transmission over links of tens to hundreds of kilometers and establishment of wavelength dependent routing WDR and reconfigurable optical add drop modules ROADM . The interconnection of multiple optical fibers with single channels or multiple WDM channels upon a single optical fiber represent what the inventors refer to as single plane interconnections typically referred to as space switching or wavelength switching. Alternatively optical interconnection networks as the inventors describe below may exploit the space domain and time domain for switching optical data packets packets . The inventors refer to such an optical interconnection network as a multi plane interconnection.

Scalability is typically limited by the switching domain as well as by the network performance e.g. the latency experienced by the packets waiting in the queue. The three possible switching domains are shown in with their respective scalability limitations. Typically single plane optical interconnection networks i.e. those exploiting a single switching domain exploit the space domain such as in broadcast and select architectures see for example Lin et al in Capacity Scaling in a Multihost Wavelength Striped SOA based Switch Fabric J. Lightwave Tech. Vol. 25 pp. 655 663 and Hemenway et al in Optical Packet Switched Interconnect for Supercomputer Applications J. Opt. Net. Vol. 3 pp. 900 913 . As the packet is being broadcast the power loss can be compensated by the optical amplifiers at the cost of amplified spontaneous emission ASE noise which ultimately limits the scalability from the minimum optical signal to noise ratio OSNR requirement. For instance in Liboiron2 the binary tree structure of the broadcast and select switch contains amplification stages after a cascade of five power splitters to maintain the optical signal power. The scalability of the single plane space architecture S was in that analysis limited to 1024 ports due to ASE noise accumulation in the SOA based space switch. Alternatively the wavelength domain can also be exploited to realize a single plane interconnection architecture see for example Gaudino wherein the scalability is limited by the wavelength tunability in the transmitters limiting the number of ports to a few tens e.g. such as for example 40 channels on 0.8 nm channel spacing in the 1550 nm window.

Accordingly to overcome the scalability limitations imposed by one switching domain multi plane architectures can be devised where multiple switching domains are exploited. In multi plane architectures ports in a card are addressed using one domain while cards are addressed using another domain. An example is given by the space wavelength SW architecture see for example Gaudino Raponi and Liboiron2 which exploits the space and wavelength domains to switch packets among cards and ports respectively. In Liboiron2 the analysis showed that greater throughput is achieved by the multi plane SW architecture while exhibiting a reduction of up to 40 of the energy per bit compared with a single plane architecture which solely exploits the space domain. While the space wavelength makes use of the same space switch structure its scalability is enhanced by the wavelength domain and the energy per bit is reduced thanks to the smaller number of active optical components used for the same throughput with respect to the single plane architecture.

An alternative design of multi plane architectures with broadcast and select switches can be realized by exploiting the third switching domain i.e. time. However the time compression efficiency limits the scalability of this domain. Packets can be compressed in time either by increasing the data rate per channel resorting to speed up or complex modulation formats or by expanding serial packets in the wavelength domain through wavelength striped techniques. The inventors have established an approach to time compression without requiring increasing costs and power consumption by exploiting convention time domain multiplexing TDM nor require complex modulation formats be implemented to encode and decode the data packets. This is referred to as a Space Time ST Interconnection Network.

The space time ST architecture consists of M cards each supporting N input ports and N output ports. The space time ST architecture exploits the space domain to individually switch packets among cards and the time domain to switch them among different ports as depicted schematically in . In addition the wavelength domain is exploited to further increase the throughput. This is achieved by encoding packets on multiple wavelengths also referred to as WDM packets and switching them in space and time among ports of different cards. The WDM packets are switched between input and output ports for example by an M M semiconductor optical amplifier SOA based switch. Optionally other optical amplification techniques may be employed including but not limited to photonic integrated circuit optical amplifiers exploiting ion exchanged glass or silica waveguides erbium doped fiber amplifiers EDFAs rare earth doped fiber amplifiers and Raman optical amplifiers. In some instances such optical amplifiers may require additional elements to provide the required dynamic range of switching on and off for the gated amplifiers.

Accordingly to an Alternate embodiment of the invention a wavelength striped process is performed electronically where the serial data packet is partitioned striped and mapped to multiple wavelengths such that each wavelength carries a portion of the serial packet. A set of optoelectronic components such as electro optical E O transmitters or sources and opto electronic O E receivers or detectors are assigned to each wavelength leading to a linear increase of the power dissipation with the number of wavelengths. However this approach requires that high speed electronics convert the bit sequence of the serial packet into parallel streams at the transmitter side and compiling the serial packet from the parallel streams at the receiver side would be required.

However within the embodiments of the invention described below the wavelength striped process is performed entirely within the optical domain using optical filters and delay lines see for example Liboiron Ladouceur et al in Low Power Transparent Optical Network Interface for High Bandwidth Off Chip Interconnects Opt. Express Vol. 17 pp. 6550 6561 hereinafter Liboiron3 . Beneficially the optical generation of WDM packets is based on a single set of optoelectronic components for the signal conversion between the electrical and optical domains for all wavelengths. The process of creating and receiving a WDM packet is illustrated in and as described herein with reference to ST Architecture . As depicted a serial packet whose transmission duration at the selected data rate is T is employed. Accordingly the bits of an Input Serial Packet are employed to simultaneously modulate a comb of N optical channels in Broadband E O . For example Broadband E O may be realized with a single broadband modulator which modulates an array of N lasers emitting on N different wavelengths. Then the passive wavelength striped mapping PWM circuit delays the modulated channels in time by T N from each other and the delayed channels are gated in time with Time Slot Packet Generator to generate a WDM packet of duration T N . The serial packet is therefore essentially compressed in time by the number of channels N and transmitted as a WDM set. This time slot packet is then coupled to an M M interconnection fabric before being coupled to PWM Reversal Circuit via the optional Time Slot Packet Clipping Circuit to generate the Output Serial Packet . Accordingly PWM Reversal Circuit delays the received WDM packet in time by T N from each other whilst Time Slot Packet Clipping Circuit gates the received WDM packet to select the bits on each packet that constitute the serial packet.

Accordingly an implementation of the ST architecture is depicted by ST Architecture in . As depicted a plurality of transmitter side cards denoted as Input Card A A to Input Card M M converts data upon a plurality of N input data ports Portto Port to time compressed WDM packets. Each of Input Card A A to Input Card M M comprises an N Channel Optical Source for example an array of N lasers or a filtered fanned out supercontinuum source is coupled to an array of external broadband optical modulators depicted as 1to NE O A through N wherein data from the Intra Card Scheduler is encoded onto each wavelength. The output of each 1to NE O A through N is coupled to its corresponding 1to NPWM A through N to delay each WDM channel by the appropriate time delay and thence to the corresponding 1to NGate A through N which gate the WDM channels at the appropriate times t t . . . t before being combined with N 1 Combiner .

The WDM packets from each of 1Input Card A A to MInput Card M M is then coupled to M M space switch interconnection controlled by Inter Card Scheduler . At the receiving side each output port from the M M space switch interconnection is coupled to Output Card A A to Output Card M M wherein the opposite process is performed. Initially the optical signal received is coupled to 1 N Splitter wherein the outputs are coupled to 1to NGate A through N and therein to 1to NPWM A through N before being converted back to electrical signals by 1to NO E A through N each of which is a broadband optical receiver. Where the combiner is a WDM then a single broadband optical receiver is employed but optionally if the combiner is an N P star coupler then P broadband optical receivers may be employed distributed apart from one another.

Accordingly it would be evident to one skilled in the art that the time domain is exploited by sequentially transmitting the WDM packets in different time slots of duration T N . The N time slots are then combined to form a time frame of duration T as shown in . For 100 utilization up to N compressed WDM packets from different ports can be accommodated in a time frame. Hence the number of wavelengths responsible for the compression factor corresponds to the number of ports. In this architecture each time slot of a time frame is assigned to a specific port of the output card. In other words a WDM packet at the k th input port Portof the h th card k 1 . . . N and h 1 . . . M destined to the n th output port Portof any given output card m with n 1 . . . N and m 1 . . . M is transmitted in the n th n 1 . . . N time slot see . However as the time slot gating is fixed at the transmitting side a cross point is now not necessary as described within the prior art see for example Dally et al in Principles and Practices of Interconnection Networks published by Morgan Kaufmann 2003 . The Intra Card Scheduler on each card for example an electrical cross point switch connects the input buffer of each port Portto each modulator input Inwith k n 1 . . . N . Hence the interconnection configuration is performed at each time frame T based on the Intra Card Scheduler decisions. The gated WDM packets are then multiplexed together at the card by the N 1 Combiner wherein the WDM packet crosses the M M space switch interconnection. At the receiving side a 1 N Splitter broadcasts the routed packet to the array of PWMs 1to NPWM A through N of each output port and an SOA gate for example selects the time slot corresponding to the output port.

The presented space wavelength interconnection network is non blocking see Dally in that at each time frame it is possible to switch up to M N packets from every input port to distinct output ports and the switching configuration can be modified at each time frame. The switching configurations and packet selection are dynamically decided by the schedulers. At each time frame the intra card and inter card schedulers select and schedule the packets to be switched according to the Two Step Scheduler TSS framework described in Raponi. In particular at each time frame the Intra Card Scheduler running on each of 1Input Card A A to MInput Card M M maps the N input buffers to the N time slots i.e. to the N output ports . This mapping should ensure that each buffer is assigned to a different time slot to avoid collisions. For example the mapping may be performed by solving a weighted matching problem based solely on buffer information related to the corresponding card. Once solved the Intra Card Scheduler is responsible for setting the electrical cross point switch depicted as internal to the Intra Card Schedule but it may be external at each time frame.

Based on the decisions of the Intra Card Schedulers the Intra Card Scheduler selects the output card for each time slot on each card. The selection should ensure that each output port on any card is receiving at most one WDM packet. The selection like that at the input cards may be performed by solving N weighted matching problems in parallel i.e. one for each output port every time frame. Once solved the Inter Card Scheduler controls the M M space switch interconnection by setting the N configurations one for each time slot.

It would be evident that the scheduling problem for the proposed architecture can be solved also by a unique single step scheduler. However in Raponi it was demonstrated that the TSS has a superior scalability in terms of computational complexity with respect to the classical single step scheduler. Moreover when practical scheduling algorithms are used with realistic traffic the sub optimality of the TSS is counter balanced by the performance degradation of the single step scheduler for very high port counts leading to an overall advantage in using the TSS compared with a single step scheduler see Raponi.

The implementation of the PWM and the M M space switch interconnection is discussed in this section to outline enabling optical technologies suitable as a result of their low propagation loss optical bandwidth power efficiency and integrability. Based on recent developments related to 100 Gigabit Ethernet technology the line rate has been assumed to be 50 Gb s and the optical modulation format to be non return to zero on off keying NRZ OOK see for example Moller in High Speed Electronic Circuits for 100 Gb s Transport Networks Proc. Optical Fiber Communication 2010 Paper OThC6 .

An important element in the low power enabling of the Space Time Architecture is the passive wavelength striped mapping PWM circuit such as PWM in and 1to Nth PWM A to N in and as depicted in according to an embodiment of the invention. In the PWM each wavelength channel should first be filtered and then delayed in time. However a challenge to address and price to pay in performing the mapping in the optical domain is power loss due to longer propagation within photonic integrated circuits which would provide a small footprint monolithic implementation of the PWM. However for experimental purposes the inventors have utilized a power efficient implementation with fiber based components see Liboiron3 where the wavelength striped process was achieved using passive optical components such as filters and fiber delay lines FDLs . Whilst fiber based implementation is viable it becomes increasing impractical and bulky when considering long delays with increasing serial packet length e.g. delaying 2048 bits at 50 Gb s requires 8 meters of singlemode optical fiber. Hence an integrated solution with propagation losses as low as possible becomes important such as silica optical waveguide technologies which allow suitable waveguide delays to be implemented on chip see for example LeGrange et al in Demonstration of an Integrated Buffer for an All Optical Packet Router IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett. Vol. 21 pp. 781 783 . In such photonic integrated circuits the total loss of the waveguide delay is strongly dependent on the layout and desired layout efficiency as waveguide bend losses increase with reducing bend radius but typically die footprint reduces with reducing bend radius. Propagation losses for single mode silica rib waveguides have been reported as low as 3 dB per meter for a 2 mm bend radius see for example Bauters et al in Ultra Low loss Silica Based Waveguides with Millimeter Bend Radius 36th European Conf. on Opt. Comm. ECOC 2010 Paper We.8.E.6 . Filtering may be achieved for example using lattice structure based upon Mach Zehnder interferometers MZIs or filters inserted into slots within the waveguides to filter each wavelength. The lattice structure has one input and consists of a binary tree of MZI stages for filtering the WDM channels such that for example P stages provide 2wavelengths using 2 1 MZIs provided that the free spectral ranges FSR of the stages are appropriately set. Hence if the first stage is set to separate the even from the odd labeled channels 2 4 6 8 from 1 3 5 7 then the second stage may be set to separate alternate channels e.g. 2 6 from 4 8 and then the final stage separates to individual channels. With a channel separation of 400 GHz approximately 3.2 nm at 1500 nm the first stage MZI MZI is designed with an FSR of 800 GHz the second stage MZIs A and B are designed with an FSR that is four times the channel separation e.g. GHz and then the third stage MZIs A through D are designed with an FSR of 3200 GHz to individually filter each channel. Between the MZI stages appropriate delays are inserted to perform the wavelength striped mapping as shown in .

It would be evident that generally other optical technologies such as those exploiting microrings and array waveguide gratings AWGs would not be suitable in this design configuration due to their high loss. For microring resonators large FSRs are achieved with small radius leading to higher loss in the resonance cavity whilst the AWG approach incurs overall greater loss due to the delay requirements within the phased array region of the circuit. Accordingly the inventors have exploited in experiments and simulations the MZI approach but different optical designs may exploit these other techniques especially if design improvements for microrings or AWGs for example result in reduced loss compared to the MZI approach.

Typically silica based MZI uses multimode interference MMI 3 dB couplers for minimal loss and required arm imbalance for the target FSR. A typical estimated insertion loss per MZI is 1 dB based on recent developments presented by Jinguji et al in Synthesis of One Input M Output Optical FIR Lattice Circuits J. Light. Tech. Vol. 26 pp. 853 866 . Time delays corresponding to a multiple of the time slot are appropriately integrated within the lattice structure. Accordingly the WDM array of optical signals from the E O are demultiplexed and time delayed within the TX PWM A before being combined using a silica based AWG with an estimated insertion loss of 5 dB see for example Kakehashi et al in Analysis and Development of Fixed and Variable Waveband MUX DEMUX utilizing AWG Routing Functions J. Light. Tech. Vol. 27 pp. 30 40 and Ito et al in Small Bend Structures using Trenches filled with Low Refractive Index Material for Miniaturizing Silica Planar Lightwave Circuits J. Light. Tech. Vol. 27 pp. 786 790 . A semiconductor optical amplifier SOA is used to generate the WDM packet by gating in time the optical signal as shown in . The gating is performed on the optical signal at the output of the AWG by the SOA which is electrically pumped with a pulse of width T N. The timing of the gating pulse with the incoming WDM packet is controlled by the Intra Card Scheduler not shown for clarity within the Input Card e.g. one of 1Input Card A A to MInput Card M M. The gating SOA also plays the important role of optical amplifier to compensate for the optical power loss in the PWM.

The implementation approach of the PWM has a strong effect on its scalability in terms of port number as certain wavelength channels experience greater insertion loss. For example with a packet sub slot of 16 ns T N with a total serial packet length of 128 ns 800 Bytes at 50 Gb s and N 8 the maximum insertion loss difference in the PWM is 10.5 dB between two channels see first insert A in . Each 16 ns delay induces approximately 1.5 dB of loss. To ensure physical layer scalability of the SOA based interconnect the laser sources may be pre compensated to obtain equal power for each channel of the WDM packet being launched in the M M interconnection . At the destination card the loss difference between channels is reversed e.g. channel 6 will experience the lowest in the PWM at the receiving side RX PWM B since it experienced the most loss in the PWM at the transmitting side TX PWM A. In the RX PWM B the maximum loss difference remains 10.5 dB between the channels as evident from second insert B which can be compensated or converted using an optical receiver with large dynamic range. In this proposed configuration the PWM can be implemented without an amplification stage and is estimated to have a footprint of approximately 21 cm. For a greater number of ports the total insertion loss using the figures and designs described supra needs to be compensated with the inclusion of one or more optical amplifiers within the PWM which may for example be SOAs flip chipped onto the planar integrated circuit see for example Maxwell et al in Hybrid Integration of Monolithic Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Arrays using Passive Assembly Proc. 55th Elec. Components and Tech. Conf. 2005 pp. 1349 1352 or formed using erbium Er doped silica waveguides such as Lee et al in Optical Gain at 1.5 m in Nanocrystal Si Sensitized Er Doped Silica Waveguide Using Top Pumping 470 nm LEDs J. Light. Tech. Vol. 23 pp. 19 25 . In the instance of Er silica waveguides the required gating may be provided by switching the pump lasers on and off and or adding gate elements to the outputs of the Er silica waveguide.

As depicted in the considered architecture for the M M space switch interconnection consists of a broadcast and select implementation with M 1 M space switches controlled by the Inter Card Scheduler and M M 1 couplers. Each 1 M space switch A through M is a binary tree structure of 3 dB couplers with SOAs while each M 1 coupler A through M is another binary tree structure of 3 dB couplers with SOAs as shown in . also indicates a possible implementation that is achieved by connecting the 1 M space switches A through M placed on M vertical input layers to the M 1 couplers A through M placed on M horizontal output layers. The passive optical interconnection can still be cumbersome as a number of connections equal to Mis required for a space wavelength network with an overall number of input ports MN. However such a number of connections is Ntimes smaller than the number of connections required by a single stage interconnection network based only on such a space switch with the same number of ports i.e. MN.

The SOAs on the terminal branches of the 1 M space switches A through M not shown for clarity act both as amplifiers and as switches that may enable or block the passage of the optical signal as decided by the appropriate inter card scheduler. The SOAs on the output of the M 1 couplers A through M are required for amplification purposes only. Moreover typically additional stages of SOAs are required every five splitting stages in both the 1 M space switch and the M 1 coupler to compensate for the power loss introduced by the 3 dB splitters i.e. the 15 dB splitting or combining loss. Alternatively where M is large multiple groups of such SOAs every 5 stages may be replaced with a single optical amplifier e.g. EDFA with higher gain e.g. 30 dB which is gated by addition of a programmable attenuator or switch and or switching on and off of the pump laser depending upon the required rise fall times of the gate. Accordingly a single 30 dB gain stage may replace 32 32 15 dB SOAs 1024 SOAs.

In each Inter Card Scheduler decides that the k th input port Ishould be connected to the n th output port Oduring a given time slot. For an energy efficient implementation therefore only the SOAs in the path from the input port Ito the output port Oshould be enabled whilst the unused SOAs are in an idle dissipating minimum power commensurate with the reconfiguration time for transmitting the next data block and enabling disabling different sets of SOAs. Accordingly the state of SOAs in the 1 M space switches A through M is controlled by the appropriate Inter Card Scheduler. In contrast the M 1 couplers A through M are not controlled by the Inter Card Scheduler unless alternate signalling is provided such that power minimization is ideally accomplished as the result of a self enabling mechanism.

The working principle of the self enabled SOA is depicted in wherein a small amount of the optical power e.g. 10 of the incoming optical packets is converted to an electrical signal via Tap and O E with a pulse width equal to the propagating packet length. The converted electrical signal is then the input of a current driver injecting carriers i.e. the current injection pump in the SOA active region to provide the necessary gain to the input packet. Accordingly such an SE SOA may be employed as a switch such that only those M 1 couplers A through M with received optical signals amplify and then for only the duration of the received data packet. Such SE SOAs have been demonstrated to switch in the sub nanosecond range see for example Gallep et al in Reduction of Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Switching Times by Pre Impulse Step Injected Current Technique IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett. Vol. 14 pp. 902 904 and Liboiron Ladouceur et al in Optimization of a Switching Node for Optical Multistage Interconnection Networks IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett. Vol. 19 pp. 1658 1660 hereinafter Liboiron4 and The Data Vortex Optical Packet Switched Interconnection Network J. Light. Tech. Vol. 26 pp. 1777 1789 hereinafter Liboiron5 and can be used to switch packets in broadcast and select space switches see for example Liboiron3 Lin and Hemeney.

Despite the high switching speed capability of SOAs a guard time guardband must be introduced for each time slot wherein the duration of this guard time depends on the rising time of the enabled SOA. Faster switching time can be achieved with a higher bias current used in the idle state as long as it is below the SOA transparency condition see for example

C. Tai and W. Way Dynamic Range and Switching Speed Limitations of an N N Optical Packet Switch based on Low Gain Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers J. Light. Tech. Vol. 14 pp. 525 533 and Burmeister et al in Integrated Gate Matrix Switch for Optical Packet Buffering IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett. Vol. 18 pp. 103 105 . However such a bias current also negatively affects the extinction ratio see for example Ehrhardt et al in Semiconductor Laser Amplifier as Optical Switching Gate J. Light. Tech. Vol. 11 pp. 1287 1295 and hence there is a tradeoff between the switching speed the extinction ratio and the power dissipation of the SOA when idle. Optionally instead of adding guardbands the inventors have established that an electrical pulse stretcher may be employed to extend the pulse such that the payload does not get alleviating the need for the guard time.

The performance of the ST architecture was evaluated and compared with the space wavelength SW architecture presented by Liboiron Ladouceur et al see Liboiron3 and a single plane space architecture S as discussed supra in respect of Section A. The metrics of interest in the assessment were the physical layer scalability the network performance and the power consumption.

The scalability in size of the ST architecture is determined by the limitation of the switching domains as shown in wherein the maximum number of cards that the network can support is constrained by the optical signal to noise ratio OSNR degradation experienced by the WDM packets when traversing the M M space switch interconnection. The physical layer analysis was performed using commercial optical system software OptiSystem . The SOA simulated was based upon the work of Tanaka see Tanaka et al in Monolithically Integrated 8 1 SOA Gate Switch with Large Extinction Ratio and Wide input Power Dynamic Range J. Quant. Elect. Vol. 45 pp. 1155 1162 with a noise figure of 8.6 dB and a saturated output power of 15.6 dBm.

The physical layer analysis accounts for both saturation power and ASE noise accumulation from the SOA devices in the data path of the WDM packet. At a modulation rate of 50 Gb s and 8 ports per card the bit error rate is lower than 10for M up to 8192 cards for a total of 216 ports. The scalability to 8192 cards of the ST architecture is four times higher than the scalability of the SW architecture and eight times higher than the scalability of the S architecture see Liboiron3. The maximum number of ports per card N that the network can support is constrained by the wavelength striped technique used for packet time compression. Since the time compression is based on WDM N is limited by the maximum number of wavelengths that can be used in the C band with an adequate physical layer performance. While a large port count is possible as for example 40 plus channels are common on long haul networks using the C band at 100 GHz 0.8 nm spacing eight ports was chosen in the proposed architecture as no amplification would be required within the PWM stage of the interconnection network.

Greater throughput can be achieved through the use of complex modulation formats. For example by encoding more bits per symbol as in 100 Gb s differential quadrature phase shift keying DPQSK the maximum throughput can be increased by a factor of 2 in the case of DPQSK without any changes to the network architecture as the interconnection is transparent to the data rate and modulation format. By using more complex modulation formats the energy consumption increases due to the more complex optical modulators e.g. nested modulators but in a predictable linear manner with the overall number of ports.

The network performance of the ST architecture is driven by the performance of the intra card and inter card scheduler algorithms and affects both the throughput of the network and the queuing delay experienced by the packets in the input buffers. The schedulers avoid packet collisions and are able to ensure the delivery of all the packets to the output ports leading to 100 throughput see for example Raponi. Therefore the level of load also corresponds to the effective network utilization as packets are transmitted between interconnected cards. The maximum throughput of the ST network is MN T packets per second. However such a theoretical value is difficult to achieve due to the necessity of introducing a guard time for each time slot. Assuming a guard time duration of kT N seconds where k is a ratio normalized to the WDM packet duration the time slot and the time frame durations increase to T N 1 k and T 1 k respectively and the maximum throughput would drop to MN T1 k with a relative performance loss of k 1 k .

The queuing delay is evaluated here to assess whether the limited scalability of the number of ports per card i.e. N 8 imposed by the physical layer is detrimental. Two configurations of the interconnection network are considered. Both configurations have the same maximum throughput i.e. the same number of total input ports MN 4096 and MN 8192 . The simulations are performed using the maximal matching algorithm iSLIP see for example McKeown in The iSLIP Scheduling Algorithm for Input Queued Switches IEEE ACM Trans. Netw. Vol. 7 pp. 188 201 in the second step of the TSS see Liboiron3. The packets are generated according to an ON OFF Markov modulated model with a mean ON duration equal to 32 packets and with uniform distribution on the destinations i.e. output ports and cards .

In summary the delay performance indicates that a low value of N ranging from 4 to 16 is preferable as it ensures a minimal delay for high loads with N 8 being the optimal value and a limited delay at medium low loads. The scalability limitation of up to N 8 ports per card imposed by physical layer performance is in fact leading to better delay performance at high loads and good performance at medium and low loads.

The energy consumption of the M M space switch interconnection and the overall ST architecture is evaluated keeping in consideration the power consumptions of the optical devices in active and idle modes. The devices contributing to the power drainage are laser arrays 8 200 mW see Zhu et al in The Fabrication of Eight Channel DFB Laser Array using Sampled Gratings Phot. Tech. Lett. Vol. 22 pp. 353 355 modulators and drivers 225 mW SOAs 5 mW when idle 455 mW when enabled see for example Tanaka and Sahri et al in A Highly Integrated 32 SOA Gates Optoelectronic Module Suitable for IP Multi Terabit Optical Packet Routers Optical Fiber Communications 2001 Vol. 4 Paper PD32 and receivers 250 mW . The overall power consumption per bit s energy per bit of the ST architecture is compared with the power consumption of the SW and S architectures as a function of the network utilization.

When the network utilization increases a large number of packets are switched and therefore a large number of optical devices are active and drain power. In particular it is assumed that the SOAs in the M M space switch are enabled when WDM packets need to be switched or idle otherwise. Therefore the average power consumption of the SOA is linearly increasing with the average network utilization. Also it is assumed that the receivers the modulators and the drivers drain more power when modulating. More specifically the power consumption of the modulator increases from 225 mW to 300 mW when utilized. The increase in power consumption of the receiver is negligible approximately 1 mW . Finally the laser arrays are assumed to be always on independent of the level of network utilization. As a result the average power drained by SOAs is more utilization dependent than the other devices.

The energy per bit of the SOA based M M space switch interconnection is shown in for varying numbers of interconnected cards M. The results for M 32 cards solid lines in the figure show an energy per bit of a few picojoules and are similar to previous works on SOA based space switches see for example Albores Mejia et al in Monolithic Multistage Optoelectronic Switch Circuit Routing 160 Gb s Line Rate Data J. Light. Tech. Vol. 28 pp. 2984 2992 . As the network utilization increases the energy per bit is almost constant or decreasing. A utilization independent energy per bit means that the energy efficiency is optimal and that the number of active SOAs increases linearly with the network utilization. In the considered M M space switch interconnection with broadcast and select architecture the SOA used for amplification at the output stage must always be active. This is why their energy per bit improves with the network utilization. In addition the amount of power associated with the SOAs in idle mode decreases with the network utilization leading to an improvement of the energy efficiency at a high level of utilization. also shows that the energy consumption is affected by the switch size M since the number of SOA devices increases as the interconnection scales. The increase in the total number of SOAs with Mexplains the increase of energy per bit for larger space switch sizes. The number of active SOAs scales linearly with M therefore the increase in power consumption is mainly due to the idle SOAs. In fact there is a significant drop of the energy per bit when the idle power of the SOAs due to the drained bias current is reduced to 10 from 5 mW to 0.5 mW . For large space switch sizes the drop in energy consumption is almost one order of magnitude. SOA devices with their idle mode consuming close to zero power 0.5 mW dashed lines in the figure would enable low energy per bit of the order of picojoules per bit for interconnection network sizes up to 1024 cards. Technological progress and innovations suggest that no current could be used in the idle mode and a switching time in the range of nanoseconds would still be possible see for example Albores Mejia.

The energy per bit of the SW interconnection network is quantified by adding the energy consumption of the M M space switch interconnection to the energy consumption of the laser arrays the receivers the modulators and the drivers. The energy per bit is evaluated as a function of the network utilization in for different sizes M N of the network architecture and it is compared with S and ST architectures.

As discussed supra in section 1D1 Scalability the ST architecture scales up to 8192 8. In contrast the S and SW architectures scale up to 1024 8 and 512 8 respectively as derived in Liboiron3 primarily limited by the physical layer. For all three architectures the energy consumption decreases at high network utilization. This reduction is only in part due to the behavior of the energy consumption of the M M space switch interconnection see . The main reason for the reduction is due to the energy consumption of the laser arrays that is constant independently of the network utilization making the network more power efficient at high utilization levels. The use of self enabling technology and SOAs with low power idle mode allows compensation for the power dissipation of the laser arrays. shows also that the single plane architecture S consumes more energy per bit than the multi plane architectures ST and SW . When comparing the three architectures with the same overall number of ports i.e. 1024 the 1024 1 single plane architecture S consumes more energy per bit than the 128 8 multi plane architectures ST and SW . The energy effectiveness of the multi plane architectures also holds when increasing their port count. In other words for the same energy per bit corresponding to the energy per bit of the 1024 1 S the SW architecture can be designed with an 8 times higher port count and the ST architecture can be designed with a 64 times higher port count.

Among the multi plane architectures the SW architecture is more energy efficient than ST only when the number of cards is low i.e. M 128 . Interestingly the energy consumption of the ST architecture increases more slowly with the network size and thus is more energy efficient than SW when M increases further. The reason for the better scalability is mainly due to the different sizes and complexities of the space switches the ST architecture requires a M M space switch that can be realized with M 1 M switches and M M 1 couplers whereas the SW architecture requires NM M space switches and couplers per card leading to MN switches and couplers . Thus the number of switches and couplers in ST architecture is reduced by a factor of N with respect to the SW architecture. This makes the ST architecture not only more scalable in size but also in energy consumption.

Within the preceding section comparisons of single and multi plane switching architectures for large scale interconnection were made with respect to considerations of scalability and power consumption. As presented in a plurality of input and output cards exploiting WDM parallelism for transmission are interconnected via an M M Interconnect exploiting SOA gating elements. It was also evident that the overall power consumption of the overall switch fabric depends heavily upon the active and idle power consumption of the amplifier SOA gating elements. Accordingly within this section variants of amplifier gated switching architectures are presented exploiting modulator based gating elements in conjunction with amplifier based gates typically SOAs in the same space switch architecture thereby taking advantage of both technologies. The modulator based gating element may for example be an optical switch based on the electroabsorption effect or a Mach Zehnder interferometer MZI .

The inventors refer to such novel switching architectures and fabrics as heterogenous space switches as opposed to homogenous space switches discussed supra exploiting only amplifier gating. As will be shown alternating amplifier SOA stages with stages of the more power efficient modulator based gates the overall power consumption of heterogeneous space switches according to embodiments of the invention are reduced with respect to a homogeneous space switch. At the same time the optical power loss caused by electroabsorption or interferometric devices can be compensated by the amplification capabilities of SOAs. Novel hybrid integration technologies see for example Roelkens et al in III V Silicon Photonics for On chip and Intra Chip Optical Interconnects Laser Photonics Rev. Vol. 4 pp. 751 779 may be exploited to realize such heterogeneous switches.

Within this section the requirements of the number of gating elements both amplifier and modulator based elements for different non blocking space switch architectures including crossbar Benes Spanke Benes Clos and hybrid Clos and their scalability for a large number of ports are assessed as opposed to the fully connected architecture or Spanke architecture exploiting 1 M splitters and M 1 combiners discussed supra. Based on such assessments the power consumption analysis is addressed to find the most promising architecture without impairing signal quality.

Within this section we evaluate the number of SOAs and modulators required in the most relevant non blocking architectures for large space switches see Dally. Each architecture A has n input and n output ports interconnected by one or multiple stages of basic switching blocks. Unless otherwise stated the basic switching block is a 2 2 optical switch that can be realized with a single stage of gating elements in particular SOAs or modulator based gates. An example of such a switching block is shown in wherein packets propagate from the input ports on the left and are switched to the output ports on the right along the established paths highlighted with black dots. Thus if Nis the total number of switching blocks of architecture A then Sswitching blocks are SOA based and M N Sare modulator based. Therefore the total number of SOAs in A W is W S . Similarly the total number of modulator based gates is Y M .

The values of Nand Sare derived for the different non blocking architectures assuming that each s th switching block must be SOA based as shown in i.e. the maximum number of modulator based switching blocks that can be traversed by a packet routed from an input port to an output port before requiring amplification by an SOA is equal to s 1 . In all considered architectures the SOA based switching blocks are arranged to minimize the overall number of SOAs for a given value of the parameters.

In crossbar interconnection architectures inputs and outputs are connected by means of a matrix to connect input i to output j the switching block in position i j must be set to the bar state whereas the other elements on row i or column j are set to cross state. Therefore the number of switching blocks is N n. The SOA based switching blocks can be placed along the matrix diagonals from top right to bottom left spaced by s so that no routing path crosses more than s 1 consecutive modulators before reaching an SOA. Without loss of generality the placement of the diagonals with SOA based switching blocks can be carried out starting from the top leftmost element. The total number of SOA based switching blocks is therefore given by Equations 1A and 1B .

The Benes Be architecture derives itself from a Clos switch which is expanded until 2 2 switching blocks are used. The Benes architecture has 2 log n 1 stages each of them composed of n 2 switching blocks. Hence

The Spanke Sp architecture differs from the other architectures considered which are based on 2 2 switching blocks in that consists of n 1 n switches each of them connected to n n 1 switches. In common with the analysis supra in Section 1 an optical implementation based on trees is considered wherein an input 1 n switch can be implemented as a binary tree with log n stages of 1 2 splitters and a final stage of gating elements see for example Liboiron2. Similarly the output n 1 switch can be implemented as a binary tree with log n stages of 2 1 couplers. Due to the loss of such passive splitters and couplers amplification is required every s stages of splitters couplers. Note that the value of s may be different from s since the power penalty of a splitter coupler can be different from that of a modulator. As presented in Liboiron2 gating elements are only required at the last stage of the 1 n space switch. To reduce the overall number of SOAs the modulators are thus placed at the last stage for a total of Y n. To avoid an excessive degradation of the optical signal quality SOAs are placed every s stages. Further in order to minimize SOA usage they are placed symmetrically with reference to the gating stage thus avoiding the largest levels of the binary tree.

With this placement the total number of amplification stages Aand Arequired for the 1 n and n 1 space switches respectively are as given by Equations 3 and 4 . Accordingly the number of SOAs Wand Win the 1 n and n 1 space switches is given by Equations 5 and 6 where i log n 2 and i log n 2 are the indices of the first amplification stage placed on the left and on the right of the modulation stage respectively.

Since the n n Spanke consists of n 1 n switches and n n 1 switches the total number of SOAs required in the Spanke architecture is given by Equation 7 .

The Spanke Benes Sp Be architecture also called n stage planar is a hybrid between the two previous architectures. It consists of n stages and

A Clos architecture is a class of interconnection networks that uses multi stage space switches and is suitable to build switches with a high port count. It consists of three stages. A re arrangeably non blocking Clos architecture with the minimum number of switching blocks can be realized with a first and third stage of 2p p p switches and a middle stage of p 2p 2p switches where p square root over n 2 . The total number of switching blocks is N 4p N p N where Nand Nare the number of switching blocks in a p p and 2p 2p space switch respectively.

To realize the p p and 2p 2p space switches only the Spanke and Benes architectures are considered as they require fewer switching blocks. Due to symmetry first and third stages are implemented using the same architecture. Accordingly the four possible hybrid Clos architectures are denoted as Sp Be Sp Be Sp Be Sp Sp Sp and Be Be Be where each stage is a either Spanke Sp or Benes Be architecture.

In the Be Be Be architecture the total number of stages can be derived as described in Section 2A2 and is equal to 2 2 log p 1 2 log p 1 6 log p 1. When placing the first SOA based switching block on the leftmost stage the total number of SOA based switching blocks is given by Equation 9 .

In the Sp Sp Sp architecture the optimal placement of the SOA based switching blocks is carried out from the center. Hence W x is the number of SOAs required in a x x Spanke architecture given in Equation 7 with x n and is given by Equation 10 . 4 2 10 

In a similar way the Sp Be Sp and Be Sp Be architectures consist of 4p p p switches for the first and second stage and p 2p 2p for the second stage. The number of SOAs is given by Equations 11 and 12 for the Sp Be Sp and Be Sp Be architectures respectively. 4 2 11 4 2 12 

Based upon the different architectures defined above in respect of Section 2A a comparison of the different architectures in terms of number of switching blocks and power consumption is carried out. The analysis exploits the implementation of SOA based switching blocks proposed in Albores Mejia consisting of two SOAs 2 of which only one is active in both cross and bar configurations. Modulator based switching blocks are implemented with two MZI 2 see for example Lee et al in Demonstration of a Digital CMOS Driver Codesigned and Integrated with a Broadband Silicon Photonic Switch J. of Light. Tech. Vol. 29 pp. 1136 1142 and Campenhout et al in Low Power 2 2 Silicon Electro Optic Switch with 110 nm Bandwidth for Broadband Reconfigurable Optical Networks Opt. Express Vol. 17 pp. 24020 24029 .

The maximum number of passive elements i.e. modulator based gates splitters or couplers that can be crossed before an amplifier is set to 4 i.e. s s 5. This number has been chosen such that the loss does not to exceed the maximum gain of the SOA i.e. the power losses of the s or s stages of passive elements are compensated by the stage of SOA based gating elements. To minimize the power consumption only the SOAs in the switching blocks along the path s are considered enabled to active state while all the other SOAs are left idle. As discussed supra to reduce the switching time SOAs in idle state are fed with a current slightly below the threshold required for amplification. In idle state SOAs will therefore drain a non negligible amount of power. In the following maximum network utilization is considered in which each input port is connected to a different output port for a total of n paths simultaneously active . Instead the MZI can be either in active state or in OFF state consuming a negligible amount of power. The power consumption is derived by assuming a normalized power consumption of 1 and 0.01 for an active and idle SOA see for example Liboiron1 and Liboiron2 respectively and 0.005 for the active MZI see for example Lee. Such values include the power consumption of the respective drivers. The SOA power consumption is referred to the unsaturated gain.

Now referring to there are depicted the maximum total number of crossed gating crossed i.e. SOA based and modulator based. The inset shows a logarithmic y axis while the bigger graph provides a zoom of the lower part of the inset due to the substantial differences between the architectures. As evident the high number of crossed gating elements impacts negatively the feasibility of the Spanke Benes and crossbar architectures as the number of gated elements scale with n and are the same order of magnitude as n. Hence at 2048 ports the number of crossed elements is already several thousand. However the Spanke architecture and hybrid Clos architecture Sp Sp Sp based on Spanke exhibit the least number of elements crossed a beneficial characteristic to reduce physical impairments. The maximum number of SOAs crossed in the largest configuration 219 ports is less than 13 for all architectures with the exceptions for crossbar and Spanke Benes. Accordingly it is evident that whilst the Benes and Be Be Be architectures require smallest number of gating elements leading to reduced complexity and cost that the lowest number of gating elements crossed is lowest with the Spanke and Sp Sp Sp architectures such that these lead to lowest optical degradation physical impairment. Accordingly a tradeoff between these two desired characteristics of an interconnection network is required.

Now referring to the power consumption per port of the different architectures is plotted as a function of the number of input output ports. As evident from this the power consumption per port for the Crossbar Spanke Benes and Spanke architectures increases with the number of ports. In the Crossbar and Spanke Benes architectures this arises from the fact that the number of active and idle SOAs scales with n. The behaviour of Spanke architecture is due to the high number of SOAs see even if most of them are in the idle state. The other architectures drain less power especially the Benes and Be Be Be architectures.

A sensitivity analysis of these architectures has been performed to investigate how the power consumption per port is affected by the power dissipation of the SOAs in the idle mode of operation. These results are presented in wherein the x axis represents the power drained by an idle SOA when the power drained by the SOA in its active state is normalized to 1. A 2input output port configuration was considered. As can be seen the Benes and Be Be Be are the architectures with the lowest sensitivity to the idle power consumption. This behaviour arises due to the high ratio of active SOAs to the total number of SOAs needed which makes the contribution of the idle SOAs negligible compared to the total power consumption. In contrast the Crossbar and Spanke Benes architectures are also essentially unaffected by the variation of idle power consumption even though the total power consumption is the highest. However the Spanke architecture is the most sensitive configuration due to the high percentage of idle SOAs compared to the total number of SOAs. Accordingly the Spanke architecture has the potential to be very power efficient when realized with SOAs that have negligible idle power consumption. It is also evident that Clos architectures based on Spanke structures in at least one stage are also influenced by this dependence even though in a less critical way due to the reduced total number of SOAs required.

Table 1 outlines the power consumption of the different architectures with 2 8192 input output ports in a homogeneous space switch s 1 and in heterogeneous space switches with s 3 and s 5. As evident from Table 1 the reduction in power consumption per port in the heterogenous implementation with respect to the homogeneous implementation is approximately 60 when s 3 and reaches approximately 80 when s 5. This reduction is due to the lower power consumption of modulator based switching blocks compared to SOA based switching blocks. The lower power consumption reduction in the Spanke Benes architecture is due to the placement strategy of the modulator based switching blocks which cannot be optimized unlike the other architectures.

Within the preceding Section 2 the optical interconnection concepts established in Section 1 with respect to multi plane Space Time interconnection networks were progressed to address alternate interconnection architectures in respect of complexity and power consumption by exploiting interferometric and SOA based gates to generate novel heterogeneous switch fabrics. Accordingly in this section the performance of such heterogeneous switches is compared with the prior art homogeneous switch architecture.

A space switch with N input and N output ports arranged in a Spanke architecture is considered see Liboiron1 where each input port is connected to an 1 N optical switch and each output port is connected to a N 1 coupler. Each 1 N switch consists of a binary tree of 1 2 splitters while each N 1 coupler consists of a binary tree of 2 1 couplers. A stage of optical gates is needed in the last stage of each 1 N such that given a packet at an input port for each possible output selection only one optical gate is enabled closed allowing the packet to be routed to the desired output while the remaining N 1 are disabled open . To recover the inherent splitting losses amplification stages of SOAs are introduced along the paths. We define the maximum span namely the number of passive elements such as couplers splitters MZI gates etc. between two consecutive SOAs as s and this depends upon the loss of the passive elements and the gain of the SOAs.

The paths traversed by a packet in the prior art homogeneous SOA based and heterogeneous architecture according to an embodiment of the invention are depicted in respectively. In homogeneous SOA based implementation depicted in with 1 N switch and N 1 coupler the number of amplifiers is minimized by placing the amplification stages starting from the SOA output gate stage within the 1 N switch and proceeding backward every s stages of splitters. For the N 1 coupler the number of amplifiers is minimized by placing the amplification stages starting from the output and proceeding backward every s stages of couplers. The number of SOAs in the last stage of the 1 N switch is N. In the heterogeneous implementation according to an embodiment of the invention as depicted in the SOA output gate is replaced by a stage of interferometric gates e.g. MZI gates. The number of SOAs is minimized by placing the first amplification stage evenly spaced from the interferometric gate within the 1 N switch and then proceeding backward towards the input according to the maximum spacing s. Similarly for the N 1 coupler the number of amplifiers is minimized by placing the amplification stages starting from the output and proceeding backward every s stages of couplers. Accordingly the amplification elements e.g. SOAs are placed as far as possible from the last stage of the binary tree thereby reducing the overall number of required SOAs and hence power consumption of the switch fabric.

A physical layer analysis has been carried out using a commercial optical system simulator OptiSystem . The parameters were set in common with those described above see also Tanaka and Lee wherein the SOAs have a noise figure of 8.6 dB a saturated output power of 15.6 dBm and an unsaturated gain value of 14.3 dB. The interferometric gates simulated were Mach Zehnder interferometers MZI with an insertion loss 

The signal traversing the N 1 coupler in the heterogeneous configuration depicted in is impaired by the presence of in band crosstalk leaked from the MZI gate . Referring to there is depicted the logarithm of the Bit Error Rate BER of the worst channel versus the optical input power P of this channel in two switch configurations with N 8192 and N 16384 ports. In both configurations the heterogeneous implementation requires a lower input power P to achieve the same BER performance of the SOA based implementation. In particular in the heterogeneous implementation the input optical power at BER 10reduced by more than 4 dB for N 8192 and 4.5 dB for N 16384 ports. This performance improvement is due to the amplified spontaneous emission ASE noise difference as a result of the different placement of the amplification stages in the two implementations. Since the first SOA crossed by the signal entering in the space switch can be assumed to work far from saturation the noise figure remains constant and hence the ASE spectral density increases with the gain. Due to the SOA placement the first SOA of the SOA based implementation needs to compensate at higher loss and thus higher noise is experienced leading to the degradation in performance.

Now referring to there is depicted the logarithm of the BER versus the output optical power for an optical input power of 2 dBm in the same switch configurations as . The penalty at BER 10of the heterogeneous implementation with respect to the SOA based one is very small for N 16384 ports at 

It would be evident to one skilled in the art that whilst the optical splitters e.g. 1 N splitter or 1 N optical switch and optical combiners e.g. N 1 combiner have been described as based upon sequential stages of 1 2 and 2 1 elements. However it would be evident that according to other embodiments of the invention 2 2 elements may be employed without changing the architectures described. However within some photonic technologies implementations of these optical splitters optical switches and optical combiners may exploit R S elements wherein R 1 2 3 4 . . . and S 1 2 3 4 . . . . For example in fused biconic fiber technologies 1 3 and 1 4 splitters may be fabricated either to reduce insertion losses overall i.e. L

It would also be evident to one skilled in the art that according to embodiments of the invention that implementations of the optical transmitters optical receivers optical splitters optical combiners optical switches and optical interconnection network may exploit one or more technologies including fused biconic tapers FBT fiber based Bragg gratings free space optics passive photonic integrated circuits PICs such as those based upon glass polymer silicon oxynitride and ferroelectrics for example active PICs such as those based upon rare earth doped glass rare earth doped silica polymers and semiconductors for example and combinations thereof such that those exploiting hybrid integration free space coupling etc. For example high index silicon oxynitride waveguides may be employed to provide the different FSR couplers as well as the required time delays and interferometric gates with hybrid integration of SOAs or externally coupled laser arrays to pump integrated rare earth doped waveguide amplifiers. Whilst focus has been given to solutions that leverage hybrid and or monolithic integration using PICs it would be evident that non PIC based solutions exploiting FBTs in combination with thin film filters TFFs and erbium doped fiber amplifiers EDFAs may similarly be deployed. Optionally partitioning of the architecture may be varied such that a WDM signal is transmitted from a transmitter to a remote node comprising the parallel wavelength striped mapping e.g. PWM Circuit and Time Slot Packet Generator . Similarly the parallel wavelength striped mapping reversal circuit may be remotely disposed with respect to the receiver Broadband O E .
