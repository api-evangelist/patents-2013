This patent application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 635 204 filed Apr. 18 2012.

Embodiments of the invention relate generally to energy management systems and more specifically to a home energy management system.

An electric grid is the distribution platform created by interconnecting energy production facilities transmission lines and power transformers so that utility companies have a means of delivering electricity from suppliers to consumers. The electric grid is an electric company s domain and in recent years the emergence of smart grid technology has given electric companies real time visibility and control over every part of that domain from the energy production facility all the way to the electric meter in a customer s back yard. Smart grids have resulted in more efficient management of the production distribution and price of energy.

In order to further optimize the efficiency with which energy is produced distributed and priced energy consumption data from beyond the electric meter e.g. from inside a consumer s household can be useful to electric utilities. Unfortunately the inside of a home or business falls outside of the domain that an electric company controls.

Embodiments of the invention describe a home energy management system. The home energy management system includes a networking device one or more energy meters and a protocol conversion device that connects the networking device to the one or more energy meters. The networking device may be a commercial off the shelf OTS device e.g. a cable modem provided by a cable service provider a consumer WiFi router a digital subscriber line DSL modem provided by a telephone network etc. with the addition of an energy management module. The protocol conversion device also referred to as an energy management bridge connects to the networking device via a transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP connection e.g. over an Ethernet line and to the one or more energy meters via additional connections supported by the energy meters. The additional connections may include Zigbee connections IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks 6LoWPAN connections power line communication PLC connections and so forth.

The energy meters may be energy monitoring and control units EMCU that sample energy usage of appliances connected to the energy meters generate data packets from the sampling and send the data packets to the protocol conversion device via one of the additional connections. The protocol conversion device may then forward the data packets to the networking device over the TCP IP connection. The networking device may process the data packets and upload payloads of the data packets to a server. The networking device may additionally provide a user interface for controlling the energy meters and monitoring a current state and historical energy usage the appliances.

The home energy management system described in embodiments herein enables users to identify and monitor the energy usage of all of the appliances in their homes. The users may use this data and the home energy management system to control when appliances are powered and unpowered thereby reducing overall energy consumption and associated costs. The home energy management system may also essentially extend a smart grid into homes and businesses enabling energy utilities to identify the energy consumption of different types of appliances using anonymized energy consumption data. The home energy management system may provide utilities with access to actionable energy consumption information bundled with the ability to take real time action.

Additionally embodiments of a home energy management system described herein have a minimal energy footprint and reduced components as compared to traditional energy management solutions. In one embodiment the home energy management system has a low overall power consumption which enables the system to be an effective energy management system that has the potential to conserve more energy than it consumes. Additionally the home energy management system may provide a positive return on investment by lowering household energy expenditure.

Referring now to the figures is a block diagram showing one implementation of a home energy management HEM System . The HEM System includes one or more networking devices e.g. first networking device and or second networking device connected to a protocol conversion device over a local area network LAN and to a server computing device over a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. The connection between for example the second networking device and the protocol conversion device may be a TCP IP connection such as an Ethernet connection in a wired example or a WiFi connection in a wireless example.

The protocol conversion device is in turn connected to multiple energy meters which may be energy management and control units EMCUs via additional connections . The additional connections may use protocols supported by the energy meters but potentially not supported by the second networking device . Examples of such connections include a Zigbee connection a 6LowPAN connection a generic radio frequency RF connection a proprietary RF connection a power line communication PLC connection or other connection types. Different EMCUs may support different connection types different protocols and some EMCUs may support multiple different connection types.

EMCUs are energy meters that additionally include control functionality as well as communication functionality. The EMCUs may include one or more memories a processing device and a communication interface. The memory may be a non volatile memory that stores firmware for the EMCU and or a volatile memory. The processing device may include a programmable logic controller PLC a microcontroller microprocessor or programmable logic device such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or a complex programmable logic device CPLD . Each of the EMCUs may consume approximately 1 Watt 0.5 Watt or less power when in standby. Moreover the power consumed by the EMCUs may be approximately 1 Watt even when under power.

Each of the EMCUs may be connected to or integrated into one or multiple appliances . The appliances may be any powered device that can plug into an electrical outlet. Examples of appliances include electric ovens electric ranges microwave ovens coffee makers washing machines dryers dishwashers televisions lights fans set top boxes vacuum cleaners air conditioners and so on.

In one embodiment the EMCUs plug into electrical outlets and the appliances plug into the EMCUs . For example the EMCUs may be wall outlet EMCUs having a single switchable outlet and a single measuring point. The EMCUs may also be power strip EMCUs having multiple configurations with switchable outlets e.g. 6 outlets in one embodiment and multiple measuring points.

In one embodiment the EMCUs are integrated into the appliances . For example the EMCUs may be components that are provided to manufacturers of the appliances . The EMCUs provided to the manufacturer may be preconfigured for communicating with a specific type e.g. model of protocol conversion device using a particular communication protocol. In another embodiment the EMCUs are integrated into wall outlets.

The EMCUs can both monitor and control the flow of power to attached appliances . Additionally in some embodiments the EMCUs can issue commands to the attached appliances . In one embodiment an EMCU can communicate with the appliance that it is attached to in order to identify a make model and device type of the appliance . The appliance may send this information to the EMCU . The appliance may also send data identifying the appliance s condition and or state of repair to the EMCU . The EMCU may then report this information to protocol conversion device which may forward the information to networking device . Alternatively a user may manually input a make model and or device type for appliances via a GUI provided by the networking device or via a simple user interface on the appliance.

The EMCUs may have communication interfaces configured to support one or more communication interfaces and protocols for two way communication with the protocol conversion device . In one embodiment one or more of the EMCUs supports a PLC protocol. In one embodiment one or more of the EMCUs supports the Zigbee protocol. EMCUs may also support 6LowPAN generic RF Bluetooth WiFi or other communication standards. In one embodiment one or more EMCUs support a combination of protocols such as both Zigbee and RF.

The EMCUs collect and store energy consumption data . The EMCUs additionally periodically send data packets containing the energy consumption data to the protocol conversion device .

In one embodiment the EMCUs can receive ON OFF and STANDBY commands from the protocol conversion device . EMCUs may also receive a power level state command that specifies a particular power level to use. The command may specify a particular voltage to provide to an appliance or may indicate a percentage of a full operating voltage or percentage of a standby voltage to apply. For example the power level state command may identify that 2 Watts be provided to an appliance or that 40 of a measured maximum power be supplied. The power level state may be used for example for dimming of a light or to provide half power to a motor. The EMCUs may also receive increment power or decrement power commands which may be used to increment or decrement an amount of power provided to an appliance by a particular amount e.g. by 0.2 Watts .

An EMCU can then relay received commands to an appliance connected to the EMCU and or control the power delivered to the appliance responsive to the commands. Responsive to an ON command the EMCU may power on an appliance. Responsive to an OFF command the EMCU may power off an appliance. Responsive to a STANDBY command the EMCU may place an appliance into a standby mode. While in the standby mode the appliance may consume a minimal amount of power but may be turned on relatively quickly as opposed to an amount of time that it may take to turn the appliance on from an off condition . Responsive to a power level state command the EMCU may provide a specified level of power to an appliance.

Responsive to an increment power command the EMCU may increase the power supplied to an appliance by a specified amount. For example an increment power command may specify that a provided power is to be increased by 1 Watt. An EMCU receiving such a command may increase a current provided power from for example 1 Watt to 2 Watts. If no increment value is specified then an EMCU may increment the power by a default incremental amount. A decrement power command may operate in the same manner as described above with regards to the increment power command but may instead cause an EMCU to reduce a supplied power rather than increase the supplied power.

The protocol conversion device also referred to as an energy management bridge is a multi protocol multi standard hardware adapter that provides the means to fill technology gaps involving different communication media and protocols that may not be supported by the networking devices . The protocol conversion device creates a uniform 2 way communication mechanism between the TCP IP protocol and the protocols supported by the EMCUs . The protocol conversion device may include a volatile and or non volatile memory a processing device e.g. a microcontroller microprocessor FPGA CPLD etc. and multiple communication interfaces to support different communication protocols such as power line communication PLC Zigbee RF generic and non generic 6LowPAN WiFi or any other protocol.

The protocol conversion device receives data packets containing the energy consumption data from the EMCUs . The protocol conversion device then forwards the data packets on to the second networking device or to the first networking device in some implementations . The protocol conversion device may also store energy consumption data which may include energy consumption data received from multiple EMCUs .

In one embodiment the first networking device is a cable modem a DSL modem a DSL router a wireless telecommunication modem e.g. a long term evolution LTE modem a worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX modem a universal mobile telecommunications UMTS modem etc. or other internet router capable of connecting the WAN to the LAN . The second networking device may be a WiFi router a network switch a wireless access point or other device capable of providing access to multiple computing devices on the LAN . In one embodiment a single networking device provides the functionality of the first and second networking devices . The networking devices may each consume 1 Watt 0.5 Watt or less of power when in standby and may consume approximately 5 Watts or less of power while in operation.

The first networking device and second networking device may each include a memory e.g. Flash memory read only memory ROM or other non volatile memory that stores firmware for the networking device. The networking devices may additionally include processing devices that execute instructions in the firmware. In one embodiment the firmware of the second networking device includes a routing module and an energy management module . The routing module may be standard firmware for a wireless router e.g. a WiFi router or other networking device that provides typical networking functionality for the second networking device . For example if the second networking device is a wireless router then the routing module may perform functions of a router a network switch and a wireless access point.

The energy management module may be hardware firmware or software installed on a standard networking device such as an internet router. The energy management module when installed on the networking device converts the networking device into an energy management gateway. Converting a networking device into an energy management gateway without compromising any of the networking device s existing functionality may be performed using a combination of the energy management module and the attached protocol conversion device . The networking device with the energy management module running on it may serve as the brains of the HEM System by storing and saving all commands configurations and data for different components of the HEM System . Note that though second networking device is shown as containing the energy management module the energy management module may alternatively be included in the first networking device .

The energy management module receives the data packets containing the energy consumption data also referred to as energy data collected by the multiple EMCUs from the protocol conversion device . The energy management module may cache the energy consumption data . Additionally the energy management module may upload the energy consumption data to the server computing device .

The energy management module provides a local graphical user interface for EMCU monitoring and control. The local graphical user interface may be accessible from the LAN regardless of a state of connectivity to WAN . Computing devices such as personal computers tablet computers notebook computers mobile phones smart televisions etc. connected to the LAN may log into the interface provided by the energy management module on the second networking device . Once a computing device is logged into the energy management module the local interface enables users to view real time and historical consumption data control appliances and set schedules for these appliances . The local interface and web service of the server computing device give energy consumers actionable energy consumption information bundled with the ability to take real time action from anywhere at any time.

In one embodiment the energy management module provides a secure always on connection between the EMCUs and the server computing device so long as the second networking device has a connection to WAN . Alternatively the energy management module may periodically connect to the server computing device to upload energy consumption data.

The server computing device provides an energy management service platform which is a comprehensive suite of services and web based applications with 24 7 availability. The service platform stores data and outputs it to a secure web based graphic user interface that enables real time and historical data review remote control of EMCUs and administration of accounts and services. Remote computing devices connected to the WAN may log into web based interface to gain access to and control the home energy management system . Accordingly a user may log in to control all of his appliances from outside of his or her home.

The energy management service platform may include a communication platform a repository system an application programming interface API an end user application and a customer application. The communication platform is middleware that securely manages the flow of data from deployed HEM Systems. The server computing device may use SSL e.g. Open SSL to establish a secure connection to the energy management module and thus to the home energy management system . The communication platform s core functions are to maintain a secure persistent connection with deployed energy management modules acquire consumption and operational data from deployed energy management modules perform maintenance tasks such as updating firmware notifying end users of events they want to know about via chat email or SMS and relaying user defined appliance control and scheduling instructions to deployed energy management modules .

The repository system stores energy consumption data retrieved from energy management modules and makes this data available to applications through the API. The API is the programming environment in which parties can develop services for delivery to consumers over the energy management service platform. Applications will have the ability take advantage of anonymized energy consumption data obtained by EMCUs in the field. Developers may not retain this information but they may be allowed to use it in applications they build.

The end user application provides a front end interface that enables energy consumers to create and set up accounts control appliances set schedules for appliances monitor real time energy consumption cumulative or by appliance access historical consumption data cumulative or by appliance configure system settings and modify account details and personal preferences. The customer application is a front end interface built primarily for use by utility companies but it may be accessed by other customer types i.e. telecommunications companies that deploy the HEM System to their customers. The customer application gives these organizations the means to access real time and historical energy consumption data at a macro and micro level export energy consumption data into tools of their choice so they may analyze data and better predict the future demand for energy suggest behavioral changes that help their customers save energy and perform other actions. For example via the customer application electric utilities may remotely run diagnostic tests and perform maintenance on deployed systems and push relevant data to deployed systems i.e. changes in energy cost .

The home energy management system described in embodiments above may offer 2 services one for energy consumers and another for utility companies. The service for consumers provides real time and historical energy consumption data by appliances or similar devices. It also gives consumers the ability to control appliances or similar devices and set schedules for them via a local interface or the Internet. When bundled with pricing information from their utility company energy consumers can see how much energy they are using in kilowatts and dollars and instantly take the action that makes the most financial and environmental sense for them.

The service for utility companies provides detailed consumption data beyond the electric meter. Utilities may obtain information on how much energy each appliance within a home or office consumes and how frequently it is used. Information may be provided at a macro level for an entire coverage area. Alternatively the information can be broken down to the point where utilities can view consumption information from a single home or business. This enables the utility to quantify any similarities in energy usage patterns by city neighborhood or street.

Traditional home energy management solutions contain a residential gateway device and consume more energy than they need to. Residential gateways and networking devices such as modems or routers consume roughly the same amount of energy approximately 5 watts. Overall consumption by traditional home energy management solutions when these devices are used in parallel is approximately 10 watts. Use of the protocol conversion device and energy management module as described herein removes one energy consuming device the residential gateway from the equation and instantly cuts consumption costs in half. Additionally by eliminating the residential gateway the HEM System described in embodiments herein eliminates the upfront purchase of a service enabling hardware device the residential gateway . That in turn speeds up the time to positive return on investment for energy consumers by reducing an overall cost of the HEM System . Accordingly embodiments both reduce an upfront cost and a total cost of ownership.

The networking device may be a standard networking device that performs the functions of one or more of a cable modem a DSL modem a DSL router a wireless router a network switch a wireless access point and so on. In one embodiment the networking device includes a routing module that performs standard operations of the networking device as well as an energy management module that adds functionality of a residential gateway for a HEM System to the networking device .

The energy management module may be software or firmware that has been added to a non volatile memory of the networking device. Alternatively or additionally the energy management module may include a hardware logic e.g. a circuit chip that is installed on the networking device. The energy management module may be installed onto the networking device by an end user by a service provider e.g. by an internet service provider or by a manufacturer of the networking device. In one embodiment the protocol conversion device installs the energy management module on the networking device . Responsive to the protocol conversion device being connected to the networking device the protocol conversion device may detect that the networking device has sufficient memory to store the energy management module The protocol conversion device may then query a remote server and request that the remote server install the energy management module on the networking device .

Alternatively the protocol conversion device may include one or more energy management module installation routines. When the protocol conversion device is connected to a networking device the protocol conversion device may identify a chipset included in the networking device and may select an installation routine appropriate to the identified chipset. The protocol conversion device may then install a version of the energy management module compatible with the identified chipset using the appropriate installation routine.

The combination of the protocol conversion device and the energy management module in the standard networking device bridges the communication gap between EMCUs which communicate over one set of communication protocols and the Internet which has its own set of communication processes and protocols. The energy management module and protocol conversion device together eliminate any need for a dedicated residential gateway hardware device thereby reducing upfront hardware costs and overall energy consumption rate.

In one embodiment the energy management module includes a graphical user interface GUI a scheduler an energy meter controller a data handler and an energy reporter . The GUI may enable end user access to all components of the HEM System including the energy management module the protocol conversion device and EMCUs. The GUI additionally provides system monitoring control and configuration capabilities locally to a user without the need for an Internet connection and remotely over the Internet .

Energy meter controller issues commands to EMCUs. The commands may include on off and standby commands. The commands may also include power level state commands increment power commands and decrement power commands. The commands may be issued responsive to user interaction with the GUI. Alternatively the commands may be issued responsive to instructions received from a remote server e.g. from a remote server that provides a web interface for the energy management modules . The commands may also be generated automatically by the scheduler according to a configured schedule.

Scheduler automates power control of EMCUs and the appliances or similar devices connected to the EMCUs. Scheduler may include a separate schedule for each EMCU and or each appliance or any combination thereof. The schedules may be set by a user via the GUI and or may be automatically set from instructions from a remote server or based on energy usage statistics. For example appliances that consume large amounts of energy may automatically be scheduled to power off during peak energy usage hours when the cost of energy may be at its highest . Each schedule may identify when to power on an appliance when to power off an appliance and so on.

Energy reporter may generate statistics from received energy data . For example energy reporter may determine average daily weekly monthly yearly etc. energy usage for each appliance generate energy usage graphs showing when appliances are used and so on. Energy reporter may also receive energy cost data from a remote server and may use the cost data and energy data to compute the average daily weekly monthly yearly etc. energy cost of each appliance. Energy reporter may also receive energy usage statistics from a remote server. The remote server may receive the energy data from data handler compute the energy usage statistics and provide the energy usage statistics to energy reporter .

Energy management module receives data packets containing energy consumption data from protocol conversion device . Data handler may then cache the energy data locally until the data is successfully uploaded to a remote data center via the internet deleted by an end user manually or deleted by the system to make room for new data. The amount of data which can be stored locally may be dependent on storage capacity of the networking device. For example cable modems and DSL routers may have minimal storage capacity. Accordingly if the networking device is a cable modem or a DSL router then data handler may store minimal or no energy data on the networking device . In contrast wireless routers typically have enough storage capacity to store up to a month of energy data .

In one embodiment data handler caches data on multiple different devices. For example data handler may cause protocol conversion device to store energy data and may cause EMCUs to store energy data. In one embodiment the EMCUs protocol conversion device and networking device maintain redundant copies of energy data. For example The EMCUs may store the last 30 minutes of energy data the protocol conversion device may store the last hour of energy data and the networking device may store the last four hours of energy data. Alternatively the EMCUs protocol conversion device and networking device cache different energy data. For example the EMCUs may store the last 30 minutes of energy data the protocol conversion device may store the previous 4 hours of energy data e.g. from 30 minutes in the past to 4.5 hours in the past and the networking device may store the previous 8 hours of energy data e.g. from 4.5 hours in the past to 12.5 hours in the past .

Data handler may receive data packets that contain the energy data and may modify or otherwise process the data packets. Data handler may decrypt the data packets extract payloads from the data packets aggregate the payloads to generate new household power consumption messages and so on. Data handler may then transmit the household power consumption messages to a remote server.

In one embodiment the energy management module provides an application programming interface API that enables third parties to develop new services for delivery over the HEM System. This gives third parties the ability to offer new products and services to a targeted audience electric companies and energy conscious consumers .

Protocol conversion device connects to networking device via a TCP IP protocol connection such as an Ethernet connection or a WiFi connection. Protocol conversion device includes multiple communication interfaces such as an Ethernet interface a universal serial bus USB interface a WiFi interface a 6LowPAN interface a PLC interface a Zigbee interface and a generic RF interface .

Protocol conversion device additionally includes a forwarding module that receives data packets on an incoming communication interface and transmits the data packets on an outgoing communication interface. In one embodiment the protocol conversion device does not attempt to interpret the payload of data packets being routed through it. This allows the protocol conversion device to handle different schemas of data encryption and different protocols during the data exchange process.

All data exchanged through the protocol conversion device may have a common unencrypted header that contains routing information and may additionally include a payload. The payload may be encrypted on unencrypted. The header of a received data packet may have a fixed size and contain information such as a source protocol identifier ID a source global unique identifier GUID a destination protocol ID and a destination GUID. The protocol ID is a unique number that identifies the communication protocols involved in each specific data packet. In one example Ethernet powerline Zigbee and so on. The source protocol ID identifies the protocol used by the source device and the destination protocol ID identifies the protocol used by the destination device. The GUID is a unique number used to identify every device in the network. The source GUID identifies the source device for a data packet and the destination GUID identifies the destination device for the data packet.

Forwarding module may analyze a received data packet to identify a destination GUID and a destination protocol ID. The forwarding module may then forward the data packet to the destination device having the destination GUID using a protocol having the destination protocol ID. For example protocol conversion device may receive a data packet from networking device via Ethernet interface that is addressed to a particular EMCU.

Forwarding module may identify the particular EMCU in the header and determine that the EMCU supports a PLC protocol. Accordingly forwarding module may transmit the data packet to the particular EMCU using the PLC interface . The protocol conversion module may also support additional routing methods such as wide broadcast routing and narrow broadcast routing. Broadcasting in this instance refers to transmitting data packets that are received by every device in a network. The protocol conversion device can when connected to networking device through an Ethernet port carry out additional tasks such as relaying data for communication with a server computing device forwarding of security certificates implementation of system configuration data verification of system identification and more.

In one embodiment the payload of data packets are encrypted at the two endpoints source and destination which recognize the encryption method and how to decode the message. The endpoints may be for example the networking device and EMCUs. In one embodiment data handler encrypts data packets that are to be sent to other devices such as EMCUs protocol conversion device or a remote server. Data handler may additionally decrypt data packets received from such other devices. Standard symmetric and or asymmetric encryption techniques using shared keys or public key pairs may be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. For example the networking device server and EMCUs may each have digital certificates associated with a unique public key pair. The EMCUs may include a public key of the networking device and the networking device may include public keys of the EMCUs. Therefore the EMCUs may encrypt data using their private keys and the networking device may decrypt the data using a stored copy of the EMCU s public keys. In one embodiment the protocol conversion device forwards encrypted data packets without reading or decrypting a payload of the data packets.

At block processing logic processes the data packets. This may include decrypting the data packets extracting payloads from the data packets and so on. Processing logic may additionally generate household energy consumption messages. At block processing logic transmits the generated household energy consumption messages to a server. The server may then compute energy consumption statistics from the energy consumption data and provide the energy consumption statistics to for example a networking device that includes an energy management module.

At block processing logic receives a login request and authenticates a user based on user provided credentials. At block processing logic provides a graphical user interface to the user that identifies appliances connected to the energy meters energy usage statistics costs associated with power consumption of the appliances scheduling options and energy meter controls. At block processing logic receives a user input to control an energy meter. At block processing logic generates control instructions and sends the control instructions to a protocol conversion device as a payload in a data packet. The data packet may be sent to the protocol conversion device via a TCP IP connection. The protocol conversion device then forwards the data packet to the energy meter via a second connection that uses a different protocol such as a Zigbee or PLC protocol. The energy meter may then execute the instructions which may cause the energy meter to turn an appliance on turn an appliance off and so on.

In the energy meter generates a data packet at block . The generated data packet may include an unencrypted header identifying the energy meter as a source device and the networking device as a destination device. The header may also identify a first protocol associated with the energy meter and a second protocol associated with the networking device. The generated data packet may also include an encrypted payload that includes energy consumption data of an appliance monitored by the energy meter . The energy meter transmits the data packet via the first protocol to the protocol conversion device .

At block the protocol conversion device determines that the data packet is addressed to the networking device and a second protocol associated with the destination device. The protocol conversion device then forwards the data packet to the networking device using the identified second protocol.

At block the networking device extracts the energy data from the data packet. This may include decrypting the payload of the data packet. The networking device then uploads the energy data to the remote server .

In the remote server authenticates a user at block . The remote server then receives user input at block . The user input may be an input to control energy meter . The remote server sends a control instruction to the networking device . The networking device may then send the control instruction to the protocol conversion device via the second protocol. Alternatively the networking device may generate a new instruction responsive to receiving the instruction from the remote server and send the new instruction to the protocol conversion device . Note that in an alternative embodiment the networking device may authenticate the user and receive the user input and may not receive any instructions from the remote server . Instead the networking device may generate the instruction based on the user input and send it to the protocol conversion device .

The instruction sent to the protocol conversion device may be a payload of a data packet. The data packet may include an unencrypted header identifying the networking device as a source device and energy meter as a destination device. The header may also identify a first protocol associated with the energy meter and a second protocol associated with the networking device .

At block the protocol conversion device identifies that the data packet is addressed to the energy meter and a first protocol associated with the energy meter . The protocol conversion device then forwards the data packet to the energy meter using the identified first protocol. At block the energy meter executes the instruction . In one embodiment the energy meter decrypts the payload of the data packet prior to executing the instruction.

The term computer readable storage medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing or encoding a set of instructions for execution by the machine that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention.

Some portions of the detailed description have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as receiving assigning modifying transmitting querying or the like refer to the actions and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

Embodiments of the present invention also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the discussed purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer system selectively programmed by a computer program stored in the computer system. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium such as but not limited to any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs and magnetic optical disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices other type of machine accessible storage media or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions each coupled to a computer system bus.
