This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. W911NF 10 1 0324 awarded by Army Research Office ARO . The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to a coaxial transmission line filter and more particularly to a coaxial transmission line slot filter with an absorptive matrix.

Microwave circuits often rely on filters in order to isolate signals from noise sources or from other portions of the circuit. These filters are often bulky and require extra hardware in addition to the wiring and structures already in place for the circuits in use. In some cases the filters are not widely tunable in either frequency cutoff or attenuation. Further the filters may or may not be low temperature compatible. Finally the filter cost may be high due to the special hardware required to implement the design.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a filter is provided and includes potting material formed into a body defining a through hole. The body includes first and second opposing faces and a sidewall extending between the first and second opposing faces. The sidewall is formed to define first and second openings at opposite ends of the through hole first angles at an interface between the sidewall and the first face and second angles which complement the first angles at an interface between the sidewall and the second face.

According to another embodiment of the invention a filter is provided for a coaxial cable including an outer sheath having one or more slits formed therein exposing a dielectric spacer between the outer sheath and an inner conductor. The filter includes potting material formed into a body about the outer sheath. The potting material contacts the exposed dielectric spacer via the one or more slits. The body defines a through hole through which the coaxial cable extends and includes first and second opposing faces on opposite sides of the coaxial cable and a sidewall extending between the first and second opposing faces. The sidewall is formed to define first and second openings for the coaxial cable first angles at an interface between the sidewall and the first face and second angles which complement the first angles at an interface between the sidewall and the second face.

According to another embodiment of the invention a filtered coaxial cable is provided and includes an inner conductor an outer sheath having one or more slits formed therein a dielectric spacer between the inner conductor and the outer sheath portions of the dielectric spacer being exposed by the one or more slits and potting material formed into a body about the outer sheath such that the potting material contacts the portions of the dielectric spacer exposed by the one or more slits.

According to another embodiment of the invention a method of forming a filter is provided for a coaxial cable including an outer sheath having one or more slits formed therein exposing a dielectric spacer between the outer sheath and an inner conductor. The method includes forming a mold with an opening attaching the coaxial cable to the mold such that the coaxial cable extends through the opening and pouring potting material into the opening and curing the potting material. The forming of the mold includes shaping the opening such that the potting material is formable into a body about the outer sheath such that the potting material contacts the exposed dielectric spacer via the one or more slits.

According to yet another embodiment of the invention a method of forming a filtered coaxial cable including an inner conductor an outer sheath and a dielectric spacer disposed between the inner conductor and the outer sheath is provided. The method includes forming one or more slits in the outer sheath assembling a mold with an opening disposing the coaxial cable on the mold such that the coaxial cable is suspended in the opening pouring potting material into the opening and curing the potting material such that the cured potting material contacts portions of the dielectric spacer exposed by the one or more slits and removing the coaxial cable from the mold.

Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features refer to the description and to the drawings.

The description provided herein relates to a filter e.g. a radio frequency RF filter that is based on a standard coaxial cable structure. The cable s outer sheath is slotted longitudinally to expose a dielectric spacer between the outer sheath and the center conductor and the resultant opening is potted in epoxy in which ferromagnetic particles are embedded. This filter is relatively inexpensive in that it uses only the existing cable used in the apparatus plus some inexpensive epoxy tunable by an adjustment of the ferromagnetic particle content and or the dimensions and number of slots is cryogenic compatible and is compact as compared to other solutions. The filter removes high frequency components from the signal line yet presents a nearly constant impedance to lower frequency signals which are passed by the device. The rejection band characteristics for this filter have the desirable property that attenuation increases with increasing frequency with no reduction in attenuation up to and possibly above about 65 GHz. This is an unusual and desirable property especially in view of the fact that most other low pass filters show increasing attenuation up to some frequency but then above that frequency the attenuation actually decreases.

With reference to a filter is provided for use in various applications such as those associated with a coaxial cable . The coaxial cable includes a conductive outer sheath an inner conductor and a dielectric spacer operably disposed between the outer sheath and the inner conductor to insulate the outer sheath and the inner conductor from one another. The outer sheath has one or more slits formed therein which expose portions of the dielectric spacer . The slits do not extend around an entire circumference of the outer sheath such that the outer sheath is a continuous element. The slits may have similar shapes and sizes or varied shapes and sizes. The coaxial cable may further include connectors at opposite axial ends thereof that will generally have larger diameters than the outer sheath . The filter further includes potting material that is formed into a body disposed about the outer sheath such that the potting material contacts the exposed portions of the dielectric spacer via the slits see and for further embodiments .

The body is formed to define a through hole through which the coaxial cable extends in a longitudinal dimension. The body includes first and second opposing faces and on opposite sides of the coaxial cable and a sidewall that extends between the first and second opposing faces . The sidewall is formed to define first and second openings and for the coaxial cable to enter and exit the through hole first angles and second angles . The first angles are defined at an interface between the sidewall and the first face . The second angles complement the first angles and are defined at an interface between the sidewall and the second face .

In accordance with embodiments the first and second faces and may be substantially planar and in accordance with further embodiments the first and second faces and may be substantially parallel with one another. In general however it is not necessary for the first and second faces and to have any particular characteristic planarity and need not be parallel with one another. As shown in the first and second faces and may be substantially oblong with rounded or semi circular ends and parallel sides. The first and second angles and are complementary with one another at corresponding portions of the first and second faces and . That is the first angle formed at a first given point of a periphery of the first face complements the second angle formed at a second point of the periphery of the second face that corresponds i.e. in terms of its distance to the ends of the body to the first given point. In some cases the first and second angles and will be right angles. However embodiments could exist in which the first angles are obtuse and the second angles are correspondingly acute and vice versa.

The potting material may include an absorptive epoxy material see and ferromagnetic particles. In accordance with embodiments the absorptive epoxy includes Eccosorb .

A method of forming the filter will now be explained with reference to . Initially as shown in a mold is made from a top piece and a bottom piece . Both the top piece and the bottom piece may be formed from Teflon or another similar non stick material. The top piece has opening cut completely through it. This opening may be rectangular or more specifically rectangular with rounded or semi circular ends. Narrow slots are cut in each end of the opening that are at least as wide as the diameter of the coaxial cable the diameter of the coaxial cable may be about 0.085 inches . The bottom piece is formed as a substantially flat body of Teflon or another similar non stick material. The top piece is affixed i.e. fastened or screwed to the bottom piece . With this construction the opening is bordered by the cutout sidewalls of the top piece and the top surface of the bottom piece . The shape of the cutout sidewalls of the top piece and the flatness or lack thereof of the surface of the bottom piece will be determinative of the shape of the body as described above.

The use of Teflon or another similar non stick material facilitates the removal of the filter form the mold once the potting material is cured as will be described below. Since the cured potting material does not stick to the Teflon it should be possible to simply slide the filter and the coaxial cable out and away from the mold . Where the first and second angles and are formed as right angles this sliding should be conducted along an axis oriented normally to the top surface of the bottom piece i.e. the removal direction of . However in the case of the embodiments in which the first angles are obtuse and the second angles are correspondingly acute and vice versa the sliding may be conducted at an angle with respect to the top surface of the bottom piece i.e. the angled removal direction of .

As shown in the coaxial cable with the slits see formed in the outer sheath is inserted into the narrow slots in the top piece such that the coaxial cable is suspended inside the opening . In accordance with embodiments the height of the top piece should be defined should such that the suspended cable is substantially centered in the opening . Sealant such as a non magnetic epoxy is then applied around the ends of the coaxial cable where the coaxial cable exits the opening through the narrow slots .

The absorptive epoxy material is then poured into the opening and thereby fully encapsulates the coaxial cable such that it contacts the dielectric spacer via the slits . The absorptive epoxy material is allowed to cure until solid. At this point the filter and the coaxial cable are removed from the mold . Removal may be accomplished by simply pulling the filter and the coaxial cable outwardly or by separating the top and bottom pieces and of the mold and pressing out the filter from the opening in either the removal direction of or the angled removal direction of .

In accordance with embodiments the slits may be 1 mm in width and may have varying lengths. By adjusting the slit lengths and the number of slits properties of the filter such as attenuation versus frequency can be set to desired values. The slit geometry determines the amount and frequency of radiation that escapes into the potting material . This radiation is then absorbed by the epoxy ferromagnetic particle combination of the potting material and leads to the observed behavior of the filter .

As shown in the formation of the one or more slits may include the removal of only material of the outer sheath . In these cases none of the dielectric spacer is removed. However in accordance with further embodiments and with reference to some of the dielectric spacer may be removed along with the material of the outer sheath . As shown in in these cases a portion of the potting material infiltrates the spacer that would otherwise be occupied by the removed dielectric spacer . In accordance with still further embodiments and as shown in once the filter and the coaxial cable are removed from the mold an outer metallic cylinder may be disposed about the filter to retain the potting material therein.

With reference to graphical depictions of performances of the filter are illustrated. In the filter has 2 slits which are 1 cm long and 1 mm wide. This filter is operable for 3 dB at 12 GHz and provides a maximum attenuation of 5 dB 65 GHz. In the filter has 4 slits that are 2.6 cm long and 1 mm wide. This filter is operable for 3 dB at 6 7 GHz and provides a maximum attenuation of 15 dB 65 GHz.

It is to be understood that a parameter affecting performance of the filter is whether or not any of the dielectric spacer is removed when the slits are formed. As noted above and in accordance with embodiments most if not all of the dielectric spacer remains and only sections of the outer sheath are removed to form the slits see . This geometry minimizes the impedance mismatch between the section of the coaxial cable that is associated with the filter and the other non filtered sections of the coaxial cable . In accordance with alternative embodiments however at least some of the dielectric space is removed in the formation of the slits . These embodiments may be particularly useful with a fixed size slit where a relatively large impedance mismatch is acceptable see .

In accordance with further aspects and with reference to a circuit is provided. The circuit employs the filtered coaxial cable as described above with the filtered coaxial cable being disposed in a low temperature measurement apparatus at various periods in the cooling stages. In this way the filter serves to attenuate unwanted high frequency noise signals. In accordance with embodiments a design corner frequency may be in the range of about 2 20 GHz and the attenuation would be adjusted by choice of Eccosorb materials slit lengths and widths and the number of slits in order to achieve the desired reduction in noise at any given frequency.
