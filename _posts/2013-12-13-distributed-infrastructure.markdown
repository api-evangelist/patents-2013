The respective disclosures of these applications patents which this document refers to collectively as the Related Applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present disclosure relates in general to tools and techniques for establishing operating and or maintaining distributed infrastructure for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage and more particularly to tools and techniques for establishing operating and or maintaining distributed infrastructure for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage using a plurality of user devices linked over a network.

The proliferation of capable user devices pervasive communication and increased bandwidth has provided opportunity for many enhanced services for users. One example is video calling. Once the domain of high end dedicated systems from vendors such as POLYCOM video calling has become available to the average consumer at a reasonable cost. For example the Biscotti device available from Biscotti Inc. provides an inexpensive tool to allow video calling using a high definition television and an Internet connection. Such devices present a powerful platform for various applications. Examples include without limitation video calling instant messaging presence detection status updates media streaming over the Internet web content viewing gaming and DVR capability. Another example of such value added services is the introduction of online gaming. Rather than playing a game by him or herself a user now can play most games in a multiplayer mode using communication over the Internet or another network.

Enabling such services is a new class of user device which generally features relatively high end processing capability which would have been unthinkable outside supercomputing labs just a few years ago substantial random access memory and relatively vast storage capabilities including hard drives solid state drives and the like. Such user devices can include without limitation the video calling devices mentioned above the presence detection devices PDDs described in the Mobile Presence Detection Application various video game consoles and the like. Such devices generally have a reliable and relatively high speed connection to the Internet to enable the value added services and significant amounts of downtime in which the processing and other capabilities of the devices are unused.

Historically in the cloud computing space infrastructure used for cloud computing and cloud storage has been hosted in large data centers that contain many general purpose and or special purpose computers. Similarly hosted applications such as web hosting e mail hosting file transfer protocol FTP functionality and or other services are typically hosted from a centralized data center. Such services may require storage computation and network connectivity. Such services may also include computational services. These services require establishing operating and maintaining such facilities as well as the networking infrastructure required to implement distributed computing or distributed data storage or the like all of which may add to the cost of the resultant cloud services. Further hosting providers typically host applications for many different entities from a small number of locations making the entire system susceptible to losses to a significant portion of the services in the case that one or more of the number of locations experience system crashes perhaps due to events including without limitation sudden high demand natural or man made disasters local regional power grid issues and or the like. Finally Content Delivery Networks which replicate and cache data closer to the users typically use a limited number of peering locations that cache content closer to users which may result in data congestion and thus long data transmission times.

Hence there is a need for more robust and scalable distributed infrastructure solutions and some such solutions can employ the powerful user devices already resident in many users homes.

A set of embodiments provides tools and techniques for establishing operating and or maintaining or otherwise implementing distributed infrastructure for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage e.g. by using a plurality of user devices linked over a network.

Some embodiments can employ data processing random access memory sensor input and or data storage capacity inherent to advanced user devices which when connected to a network for example to provide video calling services multiplayer gaming etc. can be linked to serve as distributed infrastructure for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage. With each such user device installed within customer premises existing networking components and equipment for the customer s Internet connectivity needs may be used with no additional networking infrastructure being necessary. Further such user devices in some embodiments may be low profile plug and play devices as such any costs if any for connecting such user devices to the network additional to existing network connectivity at the customer premises are minimal or negligible and the standardized platforms of such user devices provide a reliable platform to ease in configuration and resource allocation among the distributed infrastructure

As more and more such user devices are added to the network i.e. as more consumers purchase devices to participate in video calling services content delivery services gaming services and or the like the capacity of the distributed infrastructure may expand. With each successive version of the hardware for each type of user device processing power and data storage capacity per device also increases. All combined an ever expanding low maintenance low cost implementation of a distributed infrastructure may be established operated and or maintained concurrent with the user devices primary function of enabling high definition plug and play video calling services contend delivery services gaming services and or the like.

Various modifications and additions can be made to the embodiments discussed without departing from the scope of the invention. For example while the embodiments described above refer to particular features the scope of this invention also includes embodiments having different combination of features and embodiments that do not include all of the above described features.

While various aspects and features of certain embodiments have been summarized above the following detailed description illustrates a few exemplary embodiments in further detail to enable one of skill in the art to practice such embodiments. The described examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the described embodiments. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art however that other embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances certain structures and devices are shown in block diagram form. Several embodiments are described herein and while various features are ascribed to different embodiments it should be appreciated that the features described with respect to one embodiment may be incorporated with other embodiments as well. By the same token however no single feature or features of any described embodiment should be considered essential to every embodiment of the invention as other embodiments of the invention may omit such features.

Unless otherwise indicated all numbers used herein to express quantities dimensions and so forth used should be understood as being modified in all instances by the term about. In this application the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise and use of the terms and and or means and or unless otherwise indicated. Moreover the use of the term including as well as other forms such as includes and included should be considered non exclusive. Also terms such as element or component encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one unit unless specifically stated otherwise.

User devices provided by various embodiments can contain inter alia cameras microphones and or other sensors including without limitation infrared IR sensors . These sensors in conjunction with the internal processing capability of the device can allow the device to detect when a person is in the room. Additionally through means such as facial recognition and voice detection or the like the devices also can automatically recognize who is in the room. More specifically such devices can detect the presence of a particular individual.

In various embodiments each of a plurality of user devices can simultaneously connect to a display device e.g. a television TV and a local content source which can include without limitation a cable set top box STB a satellite STB an Internet Protocol television IPTV STB and or the like in a passthrough configuration. In other words such a user device is located functionally inline between the display device and the local content source. When situated functionally inline between a local content source and a display device the user device can receive an audiovisual stream output from the local content source modify that audiovisual stream in accordance with the methods described herein and in e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 561 165 filed Sep. 16 2009 by Shoemake et al. and titled Real Time Video Communications System issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 144 182 and referred to herein as the 182 patent the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference and provide the perhaps modified audiovisual stream as input to the display device. In this manner such a user device may function in a similar manner as the video communication device VCD described in detail in the 182 patent.

User devices in some instances include a network connection which may be a wired or wireless connection persistent local storage including without limitation flash storage or hard drive storage etc. memory e.g. working memory random access memory RAM etc. and one or more processors or central processing units CPUs . Some or all of these are key hardware components that can support infrastructure applications such as cloud computing hosting applications including web email FTP and computational services data content storage content delivery networks and or the like. User devices can be designed for large scale deployments and in many cases reside in an end user s residence or premises. The distribution of such a controlled platform allows for a provider to host distributed infrastructure applications across the distributed network of user devices.

Merely by way of example in some aspects a virtual machine can be run on a user device. Access to this virtual machine can be provided to end users. The virtual machine could host any operating system including but not limited to Linux Windows MAC OS etc. . End users can log into these virtual machines and use them as they would a cloud based server. The connection to the virtual machine by the end user can be direct i.e. peer to peer or relayed via a centralized computer e.g. a control server s or central server s etc. . Each user device could host one or more virtual machines VMs which may serve one or more applications and may serve one or more end users. The experience to an end user is similar to that of using a cloud computing service provider. The main difference is that the infrastructure for the VM hosting is not centralized in a datacenter but scattered across the distributed user devices.

User devices in some aspects may be configured to host applications including without limitation e mail hosting web hosting hosting file transfer protocol FTP services hosting computational services and or the like . User devices can host these services in a similar manner as hosting of such services by traditional cloud based service providers. Each user device can host one or more of these services serving one or more end users. As with hosting the virtual machine the experience to an end user is similar to that of using a cloud hosting provider. The main difference is that the infrastructure for the application hosting is not located in a datacenter but scattered across the distributed user devices.

In some embodiments at least one user device and in some cases each user device can be configured to be persistently connected to a centralized server s and or to the network regardless of whether or not there is a centralized server s . This persistent connection can be used for communication related to management control and or monitoring of the virtual machine and other hosted applications on the at least one user device.

In some cases distributed storage may be provided to end users using one or more user devices as the storage medium. The experience to an end user would be similar to that of using a cloud based storage provider. The main difference is that the storage infrastructure would be the distributed user devices rather than storage at a centralized datacenter. Additionally the storage for a particular end user may be spread across the local storage of one or more user devices. Error correcting coding can be used for efficient redundancy and replication of data across one or more user devices. Additionally standard redundant array of independent disks RAID techniques can be used to replicate data and or encode data across multiple user devices including but not limited to RAID0 through RAID9 hybrid or nested RAID e.g. RAID10 RAID 50 RAID100 etc. etc. The varying levels of redundancy across one or more user devices allow for probabilistic guarantees on the reliability of the storage that is provided to an end user. For example the more user devices an end user s storage is spread across the higher the reliability that can be guaranteed.

With regard to content delivery networks CDNs CDNs are often used to efficiently serve data and handle peak user demand for data. They operate by caching data that is in high demand at various locations in the network often closer to the end user. By distributing high demand data the load required to serve the data from a central server is reduced. In some embodiments a content delivery network may be provided to end users using one or more user devices as storage caches for content e.g. media content including without limitation video content audio content image content video game content user generated content software applications and or the like that is traditionally served off a central server. When users request content the content can be served from a user device rather than a centralized server reducing the load on the centralized server. Data that is in high demand can be cached on more user devices while data that is in less demand can be cached on fewer user devices.

Owners of user devices can be provided with a broad range of control as to how their user devices are used. For instance owners of user devices might be given the ability to opt in to permitting their user devices to be used for distributed infrastructure purposes. Some owners of devices may not wish to have their devices used by others. This may be due to privacy concerns security concerns and or not wanting system resources of their user devices e.g. the CPU memory disk storage capacity and or the like to be used by others. Herein disk disk storage disk storage local disk and so on might refer to any suitable type of local data storage device which may or may not utilize disk based data storage technologies in some embodiments these terms might refer to non volatile memory including but not limited to hard disks floppy disks magnetic tapes optical discs holographic memory erasable programmable read only memory EPROM electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory magnetoresistive random access memory MRAM and or the like. Owners of user devices may also be given the ability to opt in to certain types of infrastructure being hosted from their devices. In some cases owners may want certain types of infrastructure hosted but not others. The ability to selectively opt in gives them the capability to choose.

According to some embodiments owners of user devices may be given the ability to determine the amount of resources they would like to dedicate to distributed infrastructure. Merely by way of example a device owner may be willing to provide up to 50 of the device s CPU 25 of its memory 20 of its local storage etc. for distributed infrastructure purposes. In some instances user device owners may be compensated for the use of their device to provide distributed infrastructure. The compensation can be monetary or in other forms e.g. rebates discounts access to other content and or functionality and or the like . Additionally the compensation can be varied based on the type of infrastructure that is hosted on the owner s user device. For example hosting a virtual machine for cloud computing could be valued at a first level while hosting an email domain valued at a second level different from the first level. Further the compensation can be varied based on the amount of resources that a device owner is willing to provide. For example a device owner could be compensated more if he or she is willing to allow 20 of the local disk to be used for distributed infrastructure rather than 10 .

In an aspect the suitability of a particular user device to host one or more distributed infrastructure applications may be measured. The suitability of the user device can include without limitation metrics such as disk or local storage usage memory usage CPU usage network speed network latency firewall conditions amount of time the device is being used by the user device owner etc. Further the suitability of the device can also factor in the amount of resources the owner of the device is willing to provide for distributed infrastructure. A distributed infrastructure application may be provisioned on a user device based on the suitability metric described above and based on the application that is being provisioned. A centralized server in some embodiments can be used to facilitate the provisioning of a particular user device including downloading and installing the distributed application that the user device is hosting.

In some embodiments the system can replicate and make one or more copies of the distributed application that is being hosted on a particular user device. A copy can be kept on a centralized server. Further the copy can keep track of state information such as the actual state of a virtual machine. The copy can be updated frequently such that the central server has one or more snapshots of a particular application. The copy can serve as a backup in case of performance issues like device failure network issues power failure etc. The backup can facilitate moving the hosted application from one user device to another. In some cases the central server can be embodied as one or more of the user devices.

Performance of a user device and of a distributed infrastructure application hosted on a user device may be monitored. This can be accomplished via a side communication channel between the user device and a central server. Statistics such as CPU load memory usage disk usage disk storage read and write speed network speed network latency both for the system overall and for a particular hosted application can be reported to the server. Actions or courses of action may be triggered based on the performance metrics of user devices and the performance metrics related to applications hosted on the devices. Actions can include moving a hosted application from one user device to another when certain metrics call for such an action for example if the CPU load is too high and or the disk storage is too full or the like . In some cases based on usage of the user device by the device owner the resources of the user device can be reduced in real time. This prevents the user experience of the device owner from being compromised by hosted distributed infrastructure applications. Actions that can be taken include without limitation reducing to varying degrees up to eliminating the CPU load disk storage speed network speed and or usage allowed by the hosted application s . Additionally another approach might include adjusting the priority of the distributed infrastructure application in real time when the usage of the device by the device owner is detected.

In some cases traffic requests e.g. hypertext transfer protocol HTTP requests to user devices may be redirected. Such redirection may occur on a per request basis based on factors such as the geography of the requestor or the like. The redirect need not be to the same port e.g. port traffic may be redirected to not only a different IP address but also to a different port. Along with this the user device may be configured to service the traffic requests as specified by a controlling entity e.g. another server. Such redirecting of traffic can be particularly useful when there is a large amount of computation traffic and or user requests. Further mechanisms may be provided that allow content such as movies or portions thereof to be rapidly deployed to user devices for services of traffic requests.

In sum the techniques described herein enable virtual server farms with low investment since the user devices are being purchased by end users. The service provider therefore avoids at least in part purchasing computers housing computers paying electricity bills and or paying for network connectivity.

A user device can be any device that has processing capability random access memory transient storage and or the like collectively referred to herein as computing resources that can participate in a distributed infrastructure arrangement as described herein. In some cases a user device might have one or more sensors e.g. as described with respect to the VCDs in the 182 patent and the PDDs in the Mobile Presence Detection Applications such as microphones cameras location sensors e.g. GPS receivers infrared sensors distance measurement sensors and the like and input from such sensors can also be considered a type of computing resource in accordance with some embodiments. Thus for example a distributed infrastructure system as described herein might be able to gather and or employ input from such sensors such as facial expressions spoken expressions and or gestures to name a few examples but more generally including any type of data that can be captured by such sensors across a potentially large number of such user devices. Such input which might be collected only with user consent to protect user privacy can be used for a variety of applications such as gauging mass reaction to particular news events or other stimuli e.g. watching particular television programs playing newly released video games etc. .

In some aspects a user device is capable of communicating with a control server over a network and or can provide any of a variety of types of video communication content delivery gaming and or presence detection functionality. Merely by way of example in some aspects a user device can be capable of providing pass through video audio to a display device and or audio playback device from another source such as a set top box and or overlaying such video audio with additional content generated or received by the user device . In other aspects a user device can comprise one or more sensors e.g. digital still cameras video cameras webcams security cameras microphones infrared sensors touch sensors and or the like and or can be capable using data acquired by such sensors of sensing the presence of a user identifying a user and or receiving user input from a user further a user device can be capable of performing some or all of the other functions described herein and or in the Related Applications. Hence in various embodiments a user device can be embodied by a video calling device such as any of the video communication devices described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 144 182 a laptop computer a desktop computer a mobile phone a smart phone a tablet computer a video game console and or a streaming media player to name a few non limiting examples. In some instances user device might include presence detection functionality similar to the presence detection device PDD as described in detail in the Mobile Presence Detection Application.

In one aspect of certain embodiments as described more fully with respect to below a user device can be placed functionally inline between a local content source and a display device although this is not required in all embodiments. A local content source can be any device that provides an audio or video stream to a display device and thus can include without limitation a cable or satellite set top box STB an Internet Protocol television IPTV STB devices that generate video and or audio and or acquire video and or audio from other sources such as the Internet and provide that video audio to a display device hence a local content source can include devices such as a video game console a Roku streaming media player an AppleTV and or the like. Hence when situated functionally inline between a local content source and a display device the user device can receive an audiovisual stream output from the local content source modify that audiovisual stream in accordance with the methods described herein and provide the perhaps modified audiovisual stream as input to the display device. It should be noted however that in some cases the functionality of a local content source can be incorporated within a user device and or the functionality of a user device can be incorporated within a local content source further it should be appreciated that a user device which might or might not include local content source functionality can be disposed inline with one or more other local content sources or one or more other user devices. Hence for example a user device with some local content source functionality such as a video game console might be disposed inline between one or more other user devices or one or more other local content sources such as a cable STB satellite STB IPTV STB and or a streaming media player and a display device.

As used with regard to the relationship between the control server and a user device the term control should be interpreted broadly to include any operations that operate configure or directly control the user device as well as operations that facilitate communication between the user device and other devices networks content sources and the like and or operations that provide processing support to a user device . Merely by way of example however the control server can detect user presence identify authenticate users and or obtain and distribute content to present users. In other cases the control server can receive and or store user input and or user preferences that can specify whether and how presence information should be used whether and how the user s user device s may be used in the distributed infrastructure whether and how the user s content and profiles should be handled under certain situations and or the like. Detailed description of user presence detection and corresponding use of user input and or user preferences is provided in the 928 Application which has already been incorporated herein.

The control server can provide a user interface which can be used by users of the user devices advertisers and or the like . The control server might also provide machine to machine interfaces such as application programming interfaces APIs data exchange protocols and the like which can allow for automated communications with the user devices etc. In one aspect the control server might be in communication with a web server and or might incorporate the web server which can provide the user interface e.g. over the network to a user computer not shown in and or a machine to machine interface. In another aspect the control server might provide such interfaces directly without need for a web server . Under either configuration the control server provides the user interface as that phrase is used in this document. In some cases some or all of the functionality of the control server might be implemented by the user device itself.

In an aspect the user interface allows users to interact with the control server and by extension the user devices . A variety of user interfaces may be provided in accordance with various embodiments including without limitation graphical user interfaces that display for a user display fields on display screens for providing information to the user and or receiving user input from a user.

In some embodiments the system can include a cloud storage system which can be used as described in further detail below to store advertisements presence information images and or video that are captured and uploaded by the user devices and or the like. In some cases the cloud storage system might be a proprietary system operated by an operator of the control server . In other cases the cloud storage system might be operated by a third party provider such as one of the many providers of commercially available cloud services. In yet a further embodiment the cloud storage system might be implemented by using resources compute memory storage network etc. shared by a plurality of user devices distributed among various users of the system. Merely by way of example as described in further detail below a plurality of user devices might each have some dedicated computing resources such as a storage partition which are dedicated for use by the system and or some ad hoc resources such as network bandwidth memory processing resources etc. that are available to the system when not in use by a user. Such resources can be used as cloud storage and or can be used to provide a distributed cloud like platform on which a control server can run as a virtual machine cloud container and or the like.

According to some embodiments user device might comprise a video input interface to receive video input from a local content source e.g. a cable satellite or IPTV set top box STB and or the like and an audio input interface to receive audio input form the local content source. User device might further comprise a video output interface to provide video output to a video display device and an audio output interface to provide audio output to an audio receiver. In some cases the video display device and the audio receiver might be embodied in the same device e.g. a TV with built in speaker system or the like . With the input and output interfaces user device might provide pass through capability for video and or audio between the local content source and the display device.

User device may in some cases comprise a video capture device to capture at least one of image data or video data and an audio capture device to capture audio data. User device may also comprise a network interface at least one processor and a storage medium in communication with the at least one processor.

In some aspects a plurality of user devices might be communicatively coupled together in a network e.g. network each user device being located in one of a plurality of customer premises. In some cases multiple user devices may be located in a single customer premises. For implementing distributed infrastructure for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage a computer which might be a control central server over a network another user device of the plurality of user devices over the network and or the like might establish one or more user devices of the plurality of user devices as distributed infrastructure elements and might provide at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to the one or more user devices for hosting on the one or more user devices . In some embodiments establishing the one or more user devices as distributed infrastructure elements might comprise the computer installing software applications or software applications on at least two user devices of the one or more user devices to enable distributed processing of software applications across the at least two user devices . In some instances establishing the one or more user devices as distributed infrastructure elements might comprise the computer installing software applications or software applications on at least two user devices of the one or more user devices to enable hosting of software applications across the at least two user devices . Alternatively or in addition establishing the one or more user devices as distributed infrastructure elements might comprise the computer installing with the computer software on at least two user devices of the one or more user devices to enable distributed storage of one or more of customer data or media content across the at least two user devices . Providing the at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to the one or more user devices for hosting on the one or more user devices might in some instances comprise the computer providing mirrored copies of the at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to each of at least two user devices . In alternative or additional embodiments providing the at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to the one or more user devices for hosting on the one or more user devices might comprise the computer providing portions of each of the at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to each of at least two user devices .

In some cases the computer might be at least one of the plurality of user devices in some embodiments the computer might be at least one of the one or more user devices that are established as distributed infrastructure elements. Alternatively or in addition the computer might be a control server e.g. control server in communication with the plurality of user devices over the network . In other words a user device that is not being used for distributed infrastructure purposes may be used to control one or more user devices that are established as distributed infrastructure elements. Alternatively a user device that has been established as a distributed infrastructure element may be used to control other user devices that are established as distributed infrastructure elements. Alternatively or in addition a control server e.g. a non user device server computing system in the network may be used to control the one or more user devices that are established as distributed infrastructure elements.

In some instances the computer might determine a redundancy level for hosting each of the at least one of the one or more software applications the customer data or the media content across the one or more user devices . The redundancy level in some cases might comprise without limitation an appropriate indicator denoting the number of copies of the software application data and or media content for cloud based application hosting i.e. indicative of the number of user devices for hosting the software application data and or media content the number of portions to divide each software application data and or media content an index indicating a level of geographical diversity and or a particular redundant array of independent disks RAID type level or configuration or the like. In some embodiments the level of geographic diversity might include without limitation separate but neighboring or nearby buildings separate but nearby municipalities separate but nearby states or provinces opposite or distant parts of a municipality opposite or distant parts of a state or province states or provinces separated by one or more other states or provinces across a nation across several nations and or dispersed throughout the world or the like. RAID type levels or configurations as known in the art might include RAID0 through RAID9 and or hybrid or nested RAID e.g. RAID10 or the like each level or configuration being indicative of well defined types of data storage redundancy and associated other characteristics e.g. with or without mirroring with or without parity minimum number of drives necessary space efficiency fault tolerance array failure rate read and write performance etc. . In some embodiments the computer might provide the at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to the one or more user devices based at least in part on the determined redundancy level for hosting each of the at least one of the one or more software applications the customer data and or the media content across the one or more user devices .

According to some aspects the computer might collect resource usage information network connectivity information or both for each of the one or more user devices . The computer might determine suitability of each of the one or more user devices to host the at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content based at least in part on one or more of the collected resource usage information and or the collected network connectivity information.

The user in accordance with some embodiments might be given the ability to choose how his or her user device may be used e.g. for distributed infrastructure purposes. In some instances the computer might receive user input from the user among a plurality of users indicating what type of software applications customer data and or media content are permitted to be hosted on a user device owned by the user. In some non limiting examples the user might allow hosting some types of applications e.g. e mail hosting web hosting etc. but not allowing hosting some other types of applications e.g. file transfer protocol FTP services and hosting computational services or the like . In some examples the user might permit storage of some media content e.g. media content provided by legitimate sources but might block storage of other media content e.g. media content provided by unknown or questionable sources .

The computer might also receive user input from the user indicating at least one of a level of processing power or a level of storage on the user device owned by the user that is permitted for hosting the indicated type of software applications customer data and or media content. The user in one non limiting example may be willing to provide up to 40 of the device s CPU 20 of its memory 15 of its local storage etc. In some examples the user might put a cap on the network bandwidth allocated to distributed infrastructure implementation.

The computer in some embodiments might label each of the one or more user devices with a first label a second label or both. The first label might indicate the type of distributed hosting based on the indicated type of software applications while the second label might indicate capacity of distributed hosting based on the at least one of the indicated level of processing power or the indicated level of storage. The computer might determine suitability of each of the one or more user devices to host the at least one of one or more software applications customer data or media content based at least in part on one or more of the first label or the second label. In some cases the computer might provide the at least one of one or more software applications customer data and or media content to the one or more user devices based at least in part on at least one of the first label the second label and or the determined suitability of each of the one or more user devices to host the at least one of one or more software applications customer data or media content.

According to some embodiments the computer might monitor performance of at least one of the one or more user devices performance of the distributed infrastructure elements as a whole or both. The computer might determine one or more courses of action to invoke based at least in part on performance metrics of the at least one user device performance metrics of the distributed infrastructure elements as a whole or both. Based on such determination the computer might invoke the one or more courses of action. For example in the case that the performance metrics indicate that a particular user device has reached or is close to reaching its labeled threshold capacity the computer might invoke a course of action that reroutes data and or media content to another user device for cloud based application hosting or distributed storage thereon. In other examples if the resources of the particular user device are being utilized to a greater than usual extent by its owner then regardless of whether or not the levels set by the user for distributed infrastructure have been reached or are close to being reached the computer might invoke a course of action to give priority to the owner s usage and to reduce or eliminate the use of the resources of the particular user device for distributed infrastructure purposes i.e. by utilizing other user devices either nearby or distant user devices .

As discussed above the owner of a user device may in some embodiments be compensated for the use of his or her user device as a distributed infrastructure element. In such embodiments the computer might monitor usage of the user device owned by a user among the one or more user devices as a distributed infrastructure element over a first period e.g. a week two weeks a month two months a quarter half a year a year etc. . For example the computer might monitor processor usage memory usage local storage usage and or network usage etc. In some cases the computer might monitor the type of cloud based application hosting that the particular user device has been used for e.g. for hosting applications including but not limited to e mail websites FTP services and or computational services etc. for distributed storage of data and or media content etc. .

The computer might subsequently determine appropriate compensation to the user for use of the user device owned by the user as a distributed infrastructure element over the first period. For example the user might be compensated by rebates discounts coupons money etc. for the use of his or her user device s as a distributed infrastructure element s . The user might be compensated more for e.g. 20 CPU usage compared with 15 CPU usage or the like. Similarly the user might be compensated more for one of e mail hosting web hosting hosting FTP services hosting computational services and or distributed storage of data and or media content but less for another of e mail hosting web hosting hosting FTP services hosting computational services and or distributed storage of data and or media content.

In various embodiments herein each user device might adhere to one of a limited number of classes of hardware where each class of hardware might have a known common hardware configuration. This may be distinct from e.g. personal computers which can have an unlimited number of classes of hardware with unlimited options for different hardware and software configurations where a plurality of such unlimited number of classes of hardware may have unknown and non common hardware configurations making logistics for distributed infrastructure extremely difficult to manage.

In a non limiting example of user devices adhering to a limited number of classes of hardware a particular generation of a gaming console might have one or more revisions or releases which might occur for any number of reasons including without limitation particular bundle releases e.g. Star Wars edition of the gaming console etc. advertising reasons e.g. Hobbit edition of the gaming console in conjunction with theatrical release of the latest Hobbit movie etc. cost and availability of hardware components e.g. the processor manufacturer may be discontinuing a particular processor and releasing a new model etc. improvements in hardware capabilities or functionalities e.g. the new graphics processor might be capable of rendering higher definition graphics or a new camera might have much higher resolution etc. and or the like. The gaming console might have generation releases e.g. first generation console second generation console and so forth each successive generation release being an improvement in terms of hardware and software capability and perhaps having slightly or vastly different form factors. In some instances each generation of the gaming console might represent a different class of hardware. In other instances each revision or release of each generation of the gaming console might represent a different class of hardware. Regardless although each class whether at the granularity of generation release or revision release and or the like might have slightly different sets of hardware components with slightly different hardware capabilities and functionalities each user device in this example gaming console might have at least a minimum common hardware configuration. In some examples the minimum common hardware configuration for each such user device might include without limitation one or more of a high capacity speed processor s e.g. at least 1 GHz processor large capacity memory e.g. at least 8 Gb RAM large capacity storage e.g. at least 10 Gb local storage high resolution camera e.g. at least 8 megapixel and or the like.

In some embodiments establishing such user devices as distributed infrastructure elements might comprise determining a class of each of the plurality of user devices and determining capabilities of each user device based on the determined class of each user device. Based at least in part on the determined capabilities of each user device at least one of one or more software applications customer data or media content may be provided to such user devices accordingly for cloud computing cloud based application hosting and or cloud based data storage or the like in accordance with the various embodiments herein. Although the example above refers to a gaming console any suitable user device may be implemented so long as they have common hardware configurations distributed across a limited number of classes of hardware including without limitation VCDs smart smoke CO detectors cameras having processor memory local storage and or network functionality and or the like. Establishing distributed infrastructure with such user devices allows for utilizing normally underutilized hardware over known minimum hardware capable components with minimal overhead costs in terms of network and hardware maintenance typically incurred by cloud service providers much of which may already be borne by the user owner of such user devices at the user owner s premises for the primary functions of such user devices e.g. as a gaming device a video calling device a smoke CO detector a camera and or the like .

Turning to the method might comprise registering a master account for a user block . In accordance with various embodiments registering a master account for a user can comprise a variety of operations. Merely by way of example registering a master account can comprise creating a database entry for a particular user and or assigning authentication credentials to that user these credentials can be used to access the master account as described in further detail below.

The method can also include assign one or more user devices to the master account block . As discussed above the one or more user devices can be embodied by a video calling device such as any of the video communication devices described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 144 182 a laptop computer a desktop computer a mobile phone a smart phone a tablet computer a video game console and or a streaming media player to name a few non limiting examples. For instance the user might identify any user devices that the user owns or is otherwise associated with e.g. members of the user s family might be associated with the devices owned by the user and the system can assign those user devices to the user s master account. According to some embodiments the user s master account might include any suitable number of sub accounts. In one example each member of the user s family might be associated with a sub account linked with the master account. In some instances the user or some members of his or her family might have a work school sub account and a home sub account the former being associated with profiles and or media content appropriate for school or work while the latter being associated with all or all other profiles and or media content. In some embodiments the master account and the plurality of sub accounts might be organized as a hierarchy with the master account being at the top of the hierarchical structure having full access to profiles and media content of each sub account the sub accounts at the next level having access to profiles and or media content of only those sub accounts that the master account has given access to and the sub accounts at lower levels having limited access to profiles and or media content. For example the user s master account might have access to all profiles and or media content associated with the master account and the sub accounts. The user can provide his or her spouse with a sub account having the same access to profiles and or media content while providing limited access to profiles and or media content to each of the user s children s sub account s . In some instances the user and or the user s spouse might impose limits on access to profiles and or media content for each of their work sub accounts.

In some cases each user device might have an identifier such as a hardware identifier IP address nickname and or the like by which the system can address the user device and assigning a user device to the master account can comprise associating that identifier with the master account. When a user device is assigned to a master account the user of that account will be able to access configure and or control the user device through the control server for example as described in further detail below. In some cases the user might own a plurality of user devices and might wish to control all of the user devices from a single master account. In an aspect a user can identify such devices through a user interface to the control server.

In another aspect as described briefly above the assignment process can be simplified. When the user first configures a user device usually locally but perhaps over the network the user can provide credentials to the user device that associate the device with the master account. Thereafter the user device might be configured to communicate with the control server and identify itself using those credentials at that point the control server can assign the user device to the master account and no credentials need to be stored on the user device from that point forward other than perhaps the user device s own identifying information .

Hence the method in the illustrated embodiment might further comprise providing a user interface to allow interaction between the user and the control server block . For example the user interface can be used to output information for a user e.g. by displaying the information on a display device printing information with a printer playing audio through a speaker etc. the user interface can also function to receive input from a user e.g. using standard input devices such as mice and other pointing devices motion capture devices touchpads and or touchscreens keyboards e.g. numeric and or alphabetic microphones etc. The procedures undertaken to provide a user interface therefore can vary depending on the nature of the implementation in some cases providing a user interface can comprise displaying the user interface on a display device in other cases however in which the user interface is displayed on a device remote from the computer system such as on a client computer wireless device etc. providing the user interface might comprise formatting data for transmission to such a device and or transmitting receiving and or interpreting data that is used to create the user interface on the remote device. Alternatively and or additionally the user interface on a client computer or any other appropriate user device might be a web interface in which the user interface is provided through one or more web pages that are served from a computer system and or a web server in communication with the computer system and are received and displayed by a web browser on the client computer or other capable user device . The web pages can display output from the computer system and receive input from the user e.g. by using Web based forms via hyperlinks electronic buttons etc. . A variety of techniques can be used to create these Web pages and or display receive information such as JavaScript Java applications or applets dynamic Hypertext Markup Language HTML and or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or extensible markup language AJAX technologies to name but a few examples.

In many cases providing a user interface will comprise providing one or more display screens each of which includes one or more user interface elements. As used herein the term user interface element also described as a user interface mechanism or a user interface device means any text image or device that can be displayed on a display screen for providing information to a user and or for receiving user input. Some such elements are commonly referred to as widgets and can include without limitation text text boxes text fields tables and or grids menus toolbars charts hyperlinks buttons lists combo boxes checkboxes radio buttons and or the like. While any illustrated exemplary display screens might employ specific user interface elements appropriate for the type of information to be conveyed received by computer system in accordance with the described embodiments it should be appreciated that the choice of user interface elements for a particular purpose is typically implementation dependent and or discretionary. Hence the illustrated user interface elements employed by any display screens described herein should be considered exemplary in nature and the reader should appreciate that other user interface elements could be substituted within the scope of various embodiments.

As noted above in an aspect of certain embodiments the user interface provides interaction between a user and a computer system. Hence when this document describes procedures for displaying or otherwise providing information to a user or to receiving input from a user the user interface may be the vehicle for the exchange of such input output. Merely by way of example in a set of embodiments the user interface allows the user to log on to a master account access user devices via the control server etc.

In an aspect of some embodiments the user logs onto his or her master account at the control server in order to access and or control user devices assigned to that account. Accordingly at block the method can include authenticating the user with a set of credentials associated with the master account e.g. with any of several known authentication schemes such as a userid password challenge a certificate exchange process and or the like as well as authentication techniques described in further detail below that employ sensors on a user device such as facial recognition voiceprint analysis gesture based identification spoken identifiers and or the like . Once the user has been authenticated the user interface can present the user with a variety of different information including without limitation information about status of user devices assigned to the master account to which the user has logged on options for controlling such user devices and or the like.

Thus in some aspects the method might further comprise receiving e.g. via a network such as the Internet to name one example user preferences block and in particular user preferences relating to how the user would like his or her user devices to participate or not in a distributed infrastructure arrangement. The system might receive a variety of other preferences such as preferences related to mobile presence detection some of which are described in detail in the Mobile Presence Detection Application which has already been incorporated herein. The method then can further include controlling and or configuring the user device in some cases based at least in part on the user preferences block .

With respect to distributed infrastructure functionality user preferences might include without limitation preferences indicating whether or not to allow a user device owned by the user to be used for distributed infrastructure preferences indicating what type of software applications customer data and or media content of other user device users and or subscribers of a cloud service are permitted to be hosted on a user device owned by the user and or preferences indicating amount of resources of a user device to dedicate to the distributed infrastructure etc. In some embodiments in addition to indicating how a user s user device may be used in distributed infrastructure implementation user preferences might allow a user to indicate how the user s own applications data and or media content may be hosted on other users user devices. For example the user might be given the option to encrypt any and or all personal data any and or all personal applications and or any and or all files or lists indicating which media content are associated with the user. Common media content which might include popular media content or any other media content may remain unencrypted for common usage by any number of users on any number of user devices subject only to any subscription rental or purchase restrictions on the particular media content as associated with any user and or any user device.

In some examples the user might indicate that her user device may be used for distributed processing but not distributed cloud based data storage or vice versa. Alternatively the user might indicate that her user device may be used for both distributed processing and distributed cloud based data storage. In some embodiments the user might allow the hosting on his or her user device of at least portions of software applications that are published by known and reputable software companies or published by companies on behalf of governmental agencies or the like while blocking hosting of software applications associated with marketing spam data mining and or potential copyright violations etc. The user might also in some instances require indications that any customer data and or media content do not violate valid copyrights or the like. For instance media content provided by legitimate paid subscription services or content providers on behalf of the subscribers with whom the media content are associated might be associated with such an indication which in some cases might be by virtue of the association with one or more databases associated with the legitimate paid subscription service providers or content providers. Rather than association with the subscribers of a content provider the media content may be directly associated with the content provider in which case the indication of non violation of valid copyrights might be inferred by virtue of association with one or more databases associated with the legitimate content provider. In some embodiments user preferences might include preferences whether or not to allow hosting of at least portions of e mail domains social media websites news sites personal websites academic websites professional websites e.g. for law offices medical clinics hospitals engineering firms accounting firms etc. . In any event as the distributed processing distributed application hosting and or distributed data storage may be controlled by the cloud service provider or a third party provider rather than by the individual owners of the user devices the digital millennium copyright act DMCA and the limited liability provisions and rules applicable to providers of on line services may be applicable.

According to some embodiments the user might set limits on the usage of resources on each user device owned by the user. For example the user might indicate that when used as a distributed infrastructure element CPU usage on each user device should not exceed 50 memory usage should not exceed 25 local data storage should not exceed 20 network bandwidth should not exceed 30 of normal bandwidth etc. Although specific percentage values are given for this example the various embodiments are not so limited and any suitable percentage value or fixed value or range of percentage or fixed values may be provided as options for the user to select as part of the user preferences for each of CPU usage memory usage local data storage usage and or network usage etc. If the user owns more than one user device the user might be given the option to choose the same values or range of values for all the user devices or to set individualized preference settings for each user device.

The amount of control imposed by the control server can vary according to embodiment and implementation. Merely by way of example as noted above in some embodiments there might be no control server and the user device might incorporate all the functionality described herein with regard to the control server including peer to peer functionality distributed processing functionality distributed application hosting functionality and or distributed data storage functionality with other user devices. In other embodiments the control server or one of the other user devices might provide fairly fine grained control over the user device such as instructing the camera to capture images for purposes of determining presence. Alternatively or additionally the control server or one of the other user devices may receive the images directly and may perform the presence determination identification and or authentication procedures at the control server in the case of mobile presence detection for example . In some instances the control server or one of the other user devices might instruct the processor to execute particular portions of one or more software applications designated for distributed processing. In some embodiments the control server or one of the other user devices might instruct the local storage to store particular portions of one or more software customer data and or media content or the like. The division of responsibility between the control server and the user device can fall anywhere along this spectrum. In some cases for instance the control server might provide the user preferences to the user device which then is responsible for implementing appropriate instructions in accordance with those preferences and transmitting acknowledgements and or status information to the control server which takes the appropriate action in response to the acknowledgements and or status information such as redistributing portions of the one or more software customer data and or media content to other user devices in response to receiving and analyzing the status information or the like. Alternatively and or additionally the user device itself might be responsible for taking such actions.

At block the method can comprise determining suitability of particular software applications data and or media content for distributed hosting which might include without limitation cloud computing cloud based application hosting cloud based data storage and or the like . For example if a particular software application can easily be split or otherwise divided so as to execute the divided portions of the software application using different processors i.e. processors of different user devices or the like to achieve results similar to results obtainable if the software application as a whole was executed by a single processor then such particular software application may be deemed suitable for distributed processing. Conversely if a particular software application cannot be split or otherwise divided so as to execute the divided portions of the software application to achieve results similar to results obtainable if the software application as a whole was executed then such particular software application may be deemed unsuitable for distributed processing. Even if a particular software application is deemed unsuitable to be divided for distributed processing it may be determined if the particular software application as a whole can be executed by each of one or more user devices other than the originating user device or origination computing device. If so the particular software application might be sent to the one or more user devices for execution thereon.

Likewise if particular data and or media content can be divided and later combined then such particular data and or media content might be deemed suitable for distributed data storage. Otherwise such particular data and or media content especially if prone to errors or data corruption if divided and later combined or the like may be deemed unsuitable for distributed data storage. Even if a particular data and or media content are deemed unsuitable to be divided for distributed data storage it may be determined whether the particular data and or media content as a whole might be stored on each of one or more user devices other than the originating user device or origination computing device. If so the particular data and or media content as a whole might be sent to the one or more user devices for storage thereon.

In a similar manner if a particular software application cannot be split or otherwise divided such that divided portions of the software application may be hosted on several user devices to achieve results similar to results obtainable if the software application as a whole was hosted on a single device then such particular software application may be deemed unsuitable for distributed application hosting. Even if a particular software application is deemed unsuitable to be divided for distributed application hosting it may be determined if the particular software application as a whole can be hosted by each of one or more user devices other than the originating user device or origination computing device. If so the particular software application might be sent to the one or more user devices for hosting thereon.

If the particular software application data and or media content are determined to be suitable for hosting then it may be determined at block what the redundancy level might be for hosting the particular software application data and or media content across a plurality of user devices. For example high demand high priority and or sensitive data either copies and or portions thereof might be distributed across a larger number of user devices e.g. with several copies distributed across geographically diverse user devices or the like as compared with low demand low priority and low sensitivity data to name a non limiting example . Likewise media content that is of high demand or the like either copies and or portions thereof might similarly be distributed across a larger number of user devices e.g. with several copies distributed across geographically diverse user devices or the like as compared with low demand media content for example . High demand high priority and or sensitive software applications either copies and or portions thereof may also be distributed across a larger number of user devices in a similar manner as high demand high priority and or sensitive data or high demand data as compared with e.g. low demand low priority and low sensitivity software applications. In some cases the redundancy level might comprise without limitation an appropriate indicator denoting the minimum number of copies of the software application data and or media content for cloud based application hosting i.e. indicative of the minimum number of user devices for hosting the software application data and or media content the number of portions to divide each software application data and or media content an index indicating a level of geographical diversity and or a particular RAID type level or configuration or the like. In some embodiments the level of geographic diversity might include without limitation separate but neighboring or nearby buildings separate but nearby municipalities separate but nearby states or provinces opposite or distant parts of a municipality opposite or distant parts of a state or province states or provinces separated by one or more other states or provinces across a nation across several nations and or dispersed throughout the world etc. RAID type levels or configurations might include RAID0 through RAID9 and or RAID10 or other hybrid or nested RAID or the like each level or configuration being indicative of well defined types of data storage redundancy and associated other characteristics e.g. with or without mirroring with or without parity minimum number of drives necessary space efficiency fault tolerance array failure rate read and write performance etc. .

At block method might comprise labelling each applicable user device with the type and capacity of distributed hosting based on the user preferences e.g. preferences indicating what type of software applications customer data and or media content of other user device uses or subscribers of cloud services etc. are permitted to be hosted on a user device owned by the user and or preferences indicating amount of resources of a user device to dedicate to the distributed infrastructure as received at block .

The reader should note that a wide variety of presence based functions including without limitation those described in the Related Applications can be performed by the system in conjunction with various techniques described as part of the method and that such functions can be combined in any suitable way. Merely by way of example the 603 Application already incorporated herein described advertising techniques that can be implemented based on detected presence which is described in the 928 Application already incorporated herein . Such techniques can be integrated with various techniques described herein as part of the method for implementing distributed infrastructure for cloud computing and or cloud based data storage. For instance the system e.g. the control server the user device etc. might obtain relevant advertising material as described in the 603 Application and display such advertising over content obtained and delivered using the techniques of the method where the advertising might be part of the content that is part of the distributed data storage functionality. In some cases the determination of the relevant advertising material for each target subscriber might be determined as part of the distributed processing functionality that first gathers and then analyzes data pertaining to the subscriber s interests. Based on this disclosure the skilled reader will understand that such techniques can be combined in a number of different ways.

In first user device might correspond to user device as described in detail above with respect to while second user device might correspond to a user device including without limitation a mobile phone a smart phone a laptop computer a desktop computer a portable gaming device a portable media player and or the like.

In some cases the HD data cables might include without limitation high definition multimedia interface HDMI cables or any other suitable HD data cables. One or more of the first user devices as shown in might be configured to provide pass through audio and or video from a local content source to a display device e.g. using data cables . Merely by way of example in some embodiments a HD data input port e.g. a HDMI input port in the first user device allows HD signals to be input from the corresponding local content source and a HD data output port e.g. a HDMI output port in the first user device allows HD signals to be output from the first user device to the corresponding display device e.g. TV which might include but is not limited to an Internet Protocol TV IPTV a HDTV a cable TV or the like . The output HD signal may in some cases be the input HD signal modified by the first user device . Local content source might be any suitable local content source. As noted above a local content source can be any device that provides an audio or video stream to a display device and thus can include without limitation a cable or satellite set top box STB an Internet Protocol television IPTV STB devices that generate video and or audio and or acquire video and or audio from other sources such as the Internet and provide that video audio to a display device hence a local content source can include devices such as a video game console a Roku streaming media player an AppleTV and or the like. Hence when situated functionally inline between a local content source and a display device the user device can receive an audiovisual stream output from the local content source modify that audiovisual stream in accordance with the methods described in the 182 patent and provide the perhaps modified audiovisual stream as input to the display device . In some embodiments first user device local content source display device and second user device if any might be located at a first customer premises while first user device local content source display device and second user device if any might be located at a second customer premises

In some cases as shown each first user device might be communicatively coupled to network via either wired or wireless connection without routing through any access points. In some cases wired or wireless access to network allows first user device to obtain profiles from cloud storage system and or media content from content server and media content database independent of the corresponding local content source which is in communication with a television TV distribution network either via wireless connection or via wired connection . In some cases not shown TV distribution network which could be for example a cable television distribution network a satellite television distribution network an Internet Protocol television IPTV distribution network and or the like might be communicatively coupled with content server and thus local content source might obtain media content from content server and media content database independently of first user device . Alternatively or in addition the television distribution network might be communicatively coupled to other content servers and or other media content sources not shown .

In this manner first user device can overlay the input signal from the corresponding local content source with additional media content to produce an augmented output HD signal to the corresponding display device via data cables . This functionality allows for supplemental content which may be associated with the media content accessed by the local content source for display on display device to be accessed and presented using the first user device in some cases as a combined presentation on the display device which may be one of an overlay arrangement e.g. a picture in picture PIP display with the supplemental content overlaid on the main content a split screen arrangement with the supplemental content adjacent to but not obscuring any portion of the main content a passive banner stream with non interactive supplemental content streaming in a banner s along one or more of a top bottom left or right edge of a display field in which the main content is displayed on display device and or an interactive banner stream with interactive supplemental content streaming in a banner s along one or more of a top bottom left or right edge of a display field in which the main content is displayed on display device . Herein examples of interactive supplemental content might include without limitation content that when streamed in a banner can be caused to slow stop and or replay within the banner in response to user interaction with the content and or the banner as opposed to passive banner streaming in which information is streamed in a manner uncontrollable by the user . The interactive supplemental content that is streamed in the banner may in some instances also allow the user to invoke operations or functions by interacting therewith for example by the user highlighting and or selecting the supplemental content e.g. an icon or still photograph of a character actor actress scene etc. associated with the main content links for related webpages links to further content stored in media content database or operations to display related content on display device and or second user device may be invoked.
