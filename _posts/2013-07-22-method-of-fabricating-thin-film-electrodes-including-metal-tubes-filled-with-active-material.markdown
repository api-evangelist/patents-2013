title: Method of fabricating thin film electrodes including metal tubes filled with active material
abstract: A thin film electrode is fabricated from a non-metallic, non-conductive porous support structure having pores with micrometer-range diameters. The support may include a polymer film. A first surface of the support is metalized, and the pores are partially metallized to create metal tubes having a thickness within a range of 50 to 150 nanometers, in contact with the metal layer. An active material is disposed within metalized portions of the pores. An electrolyte is disposed within non-metalized portions of the pores. Active materials may be selected to create an anode and a cathode. Non-metalized surfaces of the anode and cathode may be contacted to one another to form a battery cell, with the non-metalized electrolyte-containing portions of the anode facing the electrolyte-containing portions of the cathode pores. A battery cell may be fabricated as, for example, a nickel-zinc battery cell.

This application is a divisional of prior filed co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 782 126 filed May 18 2010 and titled Thin Film Electrodes Including Metal Tubes Filled With Active Material and Battery Cells and Methods of Fabrication which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 179 034 filed May 18 2009 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

This invention was made with government support under contract number HR0011 06 D 0003 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA . The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

Disclosed herein are relatively thin film electrodes and battery cells and methods of fabrication including non metallic and electrically non conductive porous thin films having pores with micrometer range diameters and partially metallized pore walls with a metal thickness within a range of 50 to 150 nanometers to hold active materials within metallized portions of the pores and an electrolyte within non metallized portions of the pores.

Conventional thin film batteries are relatively thick within a range of 500 to 5000 micrometers m . Conventional thin film batteries also have high internal resistances greater than 1 000 Ohms and correspondingly low current discharge rates below 1 mA cm.

Conventional batteries include metallic and or carbon support structures to hold energy storing chemicals. The support structures may contribute more than 50 of the mass and volume of the batteries. Since the support structures do not store energy the added mass and volume of the support structures diminish energy densities and specific energies of the batteries.

A conventional thin film battery cell may include an electron non conducting separator between anode and cathode layers to conduce current therebetween. Damage to the separator may cause a short circuit in the battery and further increases the mass of the battery.

Materials and thicknesses of conventional thin film batteries also render the batteries relatively inflexible.

Conventional rechargeable batteries include lithium ion batteries which have a risk of thermal runaway which may lead to battery degradation or destruction.

An electrode may include a non metallic non conductive support structure having opposing first and second surfaces and a pore or cavity therethrough defined by a cavity wall that extends between openings through the first and second surfaces. The support structure may include a non carbon support structure and may include a polymer such as a polycarbonate and or a polyimide.

The electrode may include a metal layer having a surface in contact with the first surface of the support structure.

The electrode may include a metal tube disposed within the cavity and in contact with the cavity wall and the metal layer. The metal tube may include a metal tube wall having a height less than a height of the cavity wall.

A thickness of the metal tube wall may be within a range of approximately 50 to 150 nanometers and the metal tube may be referred to herein as a nanotube.

A thickness of the support structure and a corresponding height of the cavity wall may be within a range of approximately 1 to 20 micrometers. The metal tube wall height may be within a range of approximately 50 to 80 of the cavity wall height and may be for example approximately 8 micrometers. A diameter of the cavity may be within a range of approximately 4 to 5 micrometers. A thickness of the metal layer may be approximately 1 micrometer.

The electrode may include an electrochemically active material disposed within the metal tube and an electrolyte disposed within a non metalized portion of the cavity.

The active material may include one or more of a variety of active materials including without limitation a rechargeable nickel metal hydroxide cadmium or zinc.

The metal tube may include a metal that is compatible with the active battery material. For example where the active material includes zinc the metal tube may include a metal that does not substantially accelerate corrosion of zinc such copper.

The support structure may include a plurality of cavities each including a corresponding metal tube an electrochemically active material and the electrolyte. The support structure may have a cavity density of up to 80 .

A battery cell may include first and second such electrodes with the non conductive second surfaces of the corresponding first and second support structures in physical contact with one another and with the corresponding second surface cavity openings at least partially aligned with one another. The electrodes may be contacted to one another without a physical separator such as without an electron non conducting non metallic separator therebetween. A thickness of the battery cell may be within a range of approximately 4 to 20 micrometers.

A method of fabricating a relatively thin film electrode may include contacting a layer of metal to a first surface of a non metallic support structure such as by electrochemical deposition.

The support structure may include a second surface opposite the first surface and a cavity defined by a cavity wall that extends between openings through the first and second surfaces.

The method may include metalizing a portion of the cavity to provide a metal tube within the cavity and in contact with the metal layer such as by electrochemical deposition. The metal tube may include a metal tube wall in contact with the cavity wall and having a height less than a height of the cavity wall.

The method may include depositing an electrochemically active material within the metal tube and depositing an electrolyte within a non metalized portion of the cavity such as by electrochemical deposition.

The support structure may include a relatively thin film filter membrane such as a nucleopore filter to which the metal layer is contacted.

Alternatively the support structure may be fabricated from a resin such as a polymer resin which may include a polyimide resin.

A method of fabricating a non metallic support structure from a resin may include depositing a metal layer over a removable substrate spin coating a polymer resin over a surface of the metal layer to form the non metallic support structure as a polymer film masking the polymer film with a cavity patterned mask and etching the polymer film in accordance with the mask such as with plasma etching to form the cavity. The substrate and the mask may then be removed. An electrode may be fabricated from the remaining support structure and metal layer in accordance with the method of fabricating a relatively thin film electrode summarized above.

A method of fabricating a relatively thin film battery cell may include fabricating first and second electrodes as an anode and a cathode respectively as summarized above and contacting second surfaces of the first and second electrodes to one another with the corresponding second surface cavity openings substantially aligned with one another. The electrodes may be sealed along the edges with an organic solvent or laser welding.

Unlike metals many polymers do not have an intrinsic ability to conduct electrons or ions. Metalizing the walls of the polymer pores with one end of the pores sealed against the metal layer and the other end of the pores being un sealed allows the porous polymer structure to conduct electrons and to store battery chemicals while preserving flexibility.

Where the diameter of a pore in which energy storing chemicals reside is on the order of nanometers to micrometers energy storing chemical particles are in relatively close proximity to an electron conductor. The proximity to an electron conductor further reduces the internal resistance of the battery. For example within any part of an electrode the greatest distance between a current collecting metal tube wall and a battery chemical may be no more than 2 micrometers and a distance between two electrodes through the electrolyte may be approximately 4 micrometers which provides relatively short distances for electron ion transfer within the battery.

A battery cell as disclosed herein may have a relatively low internal resistance which may permit discharging of the battery cell at a relatively high rate with a relatively small internal voltage drop and substantially negligible heat generation

Non metallic and non carbon porous support structures disclosed herein may reduce overall mass and volume of an electrode and or battery cell and may reduce manufacturing costs. Many polymers are inherently low density materials and making them porous further reduces their mass.

Polymer based electrodes may be fabricated in relatively large sheets which may be cut to shape and bonded using conventional techniques. An electrode sheet may be for example approximately 10 micrometer high and a corresponding battery may be up approximately 20 micrometers thick with an internal resistance well under one Ohm and may discharged at a rate of several milliAmps cmto several hundred milliamps cm. Such a battery may occupy as little as or less than 1 50the volume of a conventional thin low power battery.

Electrodes and battery cells as disclosed herein may be fabricated under ambient conditions and may be cut shaped flexed and or stacked which may permit incorporation within a device to be powered.

Absence of a physical separator between electrodes may reduce internal resistances and mass and may provide additional flexibility to a battery.

Electrodes and battery cells as disclosed herein provide relatively high energy density and high power discharge capabilities.

An electrode as disclosed herein may be designed to be substantially transparent to electromagnetic radiation for a specified range of wavelength.

Electrode includes a support structure or structure which may include a non metallic and substantially non electrically conductive and which may include one or more of a polymer a polyimide nylon polyurethane polycarbonate polyvinyl chloride polycarbonate PVC ceramic aerogel silicone silicon and a non carbon material.

A portion of the cavity into which metal wall extends is referred to herein as a metalized cavity portion. A remaining portion of the cavity is referred herein to as a non metalized cavity portion . A volume of the metalized portion of the cavity may be within a range of approximately 1 to 80 of a volume of the cavity.

Electrode further includes an active material disposed within metal tube to store and discharge electrical energy.

Active material may include an electrochemically active solid and or liquid and may include a metal oxide and or metal hydroxide such nickel cadmium silver zinc copper mercury and or lead. Active material may include for example one or more of nickel hydroxide Ni OH nickel oxyhydroxide NiOOH silver oxide other metal hydroxide Zinc Zn cadmium hydrogen a metal hydride lithium lithium iron phosphate lithium hexafluoro phosphate lithium cobalt oxide lithium manganese oxide lithium nickel oxide lithium nickel cobalt oxide tin tin oxide antimony antimony oxide bismuth germanium and vanadium oxide.

Electrode may correspond to an anode or a cathode depending upon properties of active material . Example anode and cathode configurations are disclosed below.

Electrode further includes electrolyte disposed within the non metalized portion of the cavity. Electrolyte may include an aqueous solution and or a relatively viscous or gel like material such as an ionic liquid and may include one or more of an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide KOH a non aqueous solution of hexafluoro phosphate a non aqueous solution of tetra alkyl ammonium salts and an ionic liquid such as 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium hydroxide.

Electrode may be fabricated on one or more of a variety of scales including without limitation a nano scale or micrometer scale. For example metal walls may have a thickness within a range of approximately 50 to 150 nanometers and electrode may be referred to as a nano electrode. Cavity wall may have a diameter within a range of approximately 1 to 5 m and may be for example 1 2 3 4 or 5 m. Thickness or height of structure and cavity wall may be within a range of approximately 1 m to 20 m. Metal layer may have a thickness within a range of approximately 1 m to 1 mm. A height of metal wall may be approximately 8 m and a height of the non metallized portion of the cavity and of electrolyte may be within a range of 2 m to 4 m.

Electrode may implemented as part of a battery system such as disclosed in one or more examples below.

Battery cell further includes first and second metal layers and respectively each in contact with a respective one of surfaces and .

Structure includes a cavity formed therein defined by a cavity wall . Cavity wall may extend between openings of surfaces and .

Battery cell further includes a first metal tube including a metal wall in contact with first metal layer and extending into cavity . Metal wall has a height which may be within a range of 25 to 40 of a thickness of structure . First metal tube may include a metal base portion in contact with first metal layer . A portion of cavity into which first metal wall extends is referred to herein as a first metalized cavity portion.

Battery cell may include a first active material disposed within first metal tube a second active material disposed within second metal tube and an electrolyte disposed within a non metalized portion of cavity between metal tubes and .

First and second active materials and may each include one or more active materials disclosed above with respect to electrode . For example and without limitation first active material may include a cathode material such as nickel hydroxide Ni OH and or nickel oxyhydroxide NiOOH and second active material may include an anode material such as zinc Zn and or Zn OH to form a Ni Zn battery cell in which the NiOOH in electrode ve is an oxidant and the Zn in electrode ve is a reductant.

NiOOH and Ni OH are energy storing battery chemicals. When battery is fully charged the dominant species is NiOOH. Through electrochemical oxidation of the Ni OH in an aqueous solution of KOH the Ni OH is converted to NiOOH during a discharge reaction which may be represented as 

Metal tubes and may improve conduction within the corresponding electrodes and . For example Ni OH and NiOOH are relatively poor conductors of electricity but need to interact with electrons and hydroxide anions to provide or pass electricity. First metal tube may place Ni OH and NiOOH in relatively close proximity to electrons and hydroxide anions which may reduce and or minimize a distance over which current carriers electrons and ions need to travel.

A relatively small diameter of cavity may provide a relatively short path between current collectors and active materials. For example where a diameter of cavity is approximately 4 m the greatest distance between a current collector and first active material may be no more than 2 m.

Electrolyte may have a thickness within a range of approximately 2 m to 4 m. This makes the distances over which electrons and ions to travel relatively small which may reduce an internal resistance.

Metal tubes and may each include a metal that is compatible with a corresponding active material and disposed therein. For example where first active material includes NiOOH and Ni OH first metal tube may include nickel.

Where active material includes zinc metal tube may include a metal that does not accelerate a rate of corrosion of the zinc such as copper. Where second active material includes a material other than zinc such as cadmium second metal tube may include copper and or other metal. A zinc based active material may be more environmentally friendly than other metals such as cadmium

Electrodes and may each be separately fabricated and thereafter contacted to one another along corresponding surfaces and . An external edge along a junction of surfaces and may be sealed with an electrically non conductive sealant such as a polymer sealant which may serve to hold electrodes and together and or to substantially prevent evaporation of electrolyte .

Because of the non conducting property of structure and because surfaces of and are not metallized surfaces and may be physically contacted to one another without a physical separator such as without an electron and or ion non conducting separator therebetween. Absence of a physical separator may reduce an internal resistance of battery .

A physical separator may however be included such as to seal an electron sheet to prevent contamination and or evaporation of an electrolyte prior to fabrication of a battery cell and or for other purposes.

Battery cell may be fabricated on one or more of a variety of scales such as described above with respect to electrode . Battery may for example have a thickness of approximately 20 m.

Anode includes a polymer support having a plurality of cavities and and corresponding metal tubes and which may be substantially parallel to one another and may be distributed substantially uniformly over polymer support . Anode may have a cavity density within range of approximately 20 30 million cavities per cm.

Battery may be configured to generate a substantially fixed voltage across first and second metal layers and .

Multiple battery cells may be stacked to provide an increased voltage level such as disclosed below with respect to .

First battery cell may include an anode and a corresponding anode conducting metal layer having an anode conducting side . First battery cell may further include a cathode and a corresponding cathode conducting metal layer having cathode conducting side .

Second battery cell may include an anode and a corresponding anode conducting metal layer having an anode conducting side . First battery cell may further include a cathode and a corresponding cathode conducting metal layer having cathode conducting side .

Battery cells and may be stacked with anode conducting side in contact with cathode conducting side .

Battery may include one or more additional stacked battery cells such as a battery cell to obtain a battery of a desired thickness and or voltage.

Battery may provide a substantially fixed voltage of nV where n is an integer number of stacked batteries and V is the voltage of each individual battery cell within battery .

In and battery cells are illustrated with opposing cavities of first and electrodes substantially aligned with one another. Opposing cavities do not however necessarily need to be substantially aligned with one another. Partial alignment will suffice including partial alignment of a subset of cavities. For example first and second electrodes may each include millions of cavities. The first and second electrodes will form a battery when one or more cavities of the first electrode are in at least partial alignment with one or more cavities of the second electrode.

In battery cells are further illustrated with first and second electrodes having substantially similar cavity patterns e.g. cavity diameters placement and or density . Cavity patterns of first and second electrodes do not however necessarily need to be substantially similar to one another. For example anode cavities may have a first diameter and cathode cavities may have a second diameter. This may help to ensure that at least a subset of anode cavities will at least partially align with a subset of cathode cavities. For example where a diameter of anode cavities differs from a diameter of cathode cavities by a factor of two approximately 90 of the anode cavities will be at least partially aligned with cathode cavities.

At a portion of a cavity wall proximate to the first metal layer is metalized such as by electrochemical deposition or electrolysis using an appropriate salt solution.

At an active battery material is deposited within the metalized portion of the cavity such as by electrochemical deposition.

Referring back to the cavity wall portion may be metalized with a metal that is substantially non reactive with respect to the active battery material and the structure.

At an electrolyte is deposited within a non metalized portion of the cavity to form an electrode such as described above with respect to .

The structure may include a plurality of cavities and the metallization at the depositing of the reactive material at and the depositing of the electrolyte at may be performed with respect to all or substantially all of the cavities.

Method may be implemented to produce an anode and a cathode which may be joined together to produce a battery such as described below with respect to .

At a first metal layer is contacted to a first surface of a first non metal non conductive porous support structure such as described above with respect to .

At a portion of a cavity wall of the support structure is metalized such as described above with respect to .

At a second metal layer is contacted to a first surface of a second non metal non conductive porous support structure such as described above with respect to .

At a portion of a cavity wall proximate to the second metal layer is metalized such as described above with respect to .

At surfaces of the first and second non metal porous support structures that are opposite the corresponding first and second metal layers are contacted to one another with corresponding cavity openings at least partially aligned with one another to form a battery cell such as disclosed above with respect to one or more of .

At metal layer is deposited over a removable substrate illustrated in as metal layer and substrate . Metal layer may correspond to metal layer in and may have a thickness within a range of approximately 1 m to 1 mm. Substrate may include for example one or more of silicon oxide aluminum oxide and co fired alumina.

At a relatively thin layer of a substantially non conductive resin such as a non conductive polyimide resin is deposited over the metal layer. The resin may be spin coated over the metal layer.

At the resin is cured to a relatively thin film illustrated in as a thin film which may correspond to support structure in .

At cavities are formed through the film in accordance with the openings through the mask. This is illustrated in with cavities which may correspond to the cavity defined by the cavity wall in . Cavities may be formed by plasma etching.

At the substrate and the mask are removed or etched away to provide a substantially non conductive support structure having a plurality of cavities between first and second surfaces and a metal layer deposited over the first surface such as illustrated in .

Cavities in may thereafter be metallized and filled with an active battery material and electrolyte such as described in one or more examples herein. After the walls of cavities are metalized if support structure were removed the metal walls may appear as tubes having a wall thickness in a nanometer range such that a battery formed therefrom is referred to herein as a nanotube battery.

Metallization of cavity walls as disclosed herein may be preceded by sensitizing the cavity walls such as to improve adherence of the metal to the cavity walls. Sensitizing may include contacting a support structure such as second surface and the cavity defined by the cavity wall in with an aqueous solution of tin chloride followed by an aqueous solution of palladium chloride and thereafter rinsing and cleaning the support structure. After sensitizing electrolysis may be performed using an appropriate salt solution to metalize the cavity walls.

Sensitizing may be performed selectively depending upon a type of metal to be deposited. For example it has been observed that tin palladium sensitization may be useful for copper deposition over a polyimide support structure. For nickel deposition over a polyimide support structure tin palladium sensitization may be omitted.

Metallization of cavity walls may result in metallization of other portions of a support structure such as second surface in as illustrated in .

One or more techniques may be employed to avoid metalizing the surface of the support structure . For example in an additional layer of material may be deposited over a surface of support structure . Surface may correspond to second surface in . The additional layer may be formed with the same material used for support structure .

Mask layer in may then be placed over the additional layer and cavities in may be formed through the additional layer and layer . Thereafter cavities may be metallized such as described in one or more examples above and the additional layer may thereafter be removed from support structure . Such a technique substantially precludes metallization of surface .

Thin film electrodes have been fabricated with polycarbonate structures and with polyimide structures. Structural and chemical properties of the electrodes were evaluated with scanning electron microscope SEM energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy EDS and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS techniques. Electrochemical and power source properties were evaluated with charge discharge techniques. A summary of features are provided in Table 1 below.

Polycarbonate based electrodes were fabricated in accordance with method from a commercially available polycarbonate membrane known as a nucleopore filter.

A nucleopore filter is micro filter fabricated from a plastic membrane such as a polycarbonate membrane in which pores of several micrometers wide are created. The pores may be created by radiating the membrane to weaken areas of the plastic which can be removed with acid or other chemicals.

Thin film electrodes have been fabricated with a nucleopore filter having a 4 pore density i.e. four percent of the surface has pores and 5 m pore diameters. The electrodes were fabricated from 1 inch diameter portions of the nucleopore membrane. A layer of nickel approximately 0.5 m thick was deposited on a first surface of the membrane. Nickel vapor was deposited over a second surface of the membrane to metalize the pores.

A battery cell constructed from the polycarbonate based electrodes had a thickness of 20 m generated 125 A cm and charged and discharged in excess of 200 times. Features of the battery cell are summarized in Table 1 below.

Over time it was observed that the nickel layer delaminated from the polycarbonate membrane. This may indicate that the nickel layer did not sufficiently seal the pores which may have permitted the aqueous electrolyte to leak which may have caused the delamination.

Polycarbonate may not be sufficiently stable in alkali which may reduce a shelf life of a polycarbonate membrane based battery.

The metallized pore walls effectively reduce the internal resistance of the cells without adding significant mass or volume and without substantially impacting a flexibility of the electrode.

SEM images of nickel based electrodes subsequent to the approximately 100 discharge and recharge cycles show that the active chemicals remained inside the nickel tubes.

With respect to zinc based electrodes it was observed that zinc metallization of pore walls was not always uniform. This may have been related to surface tension or wetability of the metallized pores with the zinc deposition solution.

An electrode for which substantially all of the pores were sufficiently metallized with zinc was coupled with a nickel electrode to form a Ni Zn battery cell having a cross sectional area of 1.23 cm a thickness of 20 m and a volume of 2.46 mm 2.46 10L .

The battery cell was charged and repeatedly discharged and recharged for approximately 100 cycles. Discharge characteristics are provided below with respect to . The discharge characteristics of were collected under forced discharge conditions at a rate of 2 mA in and at a rate of 1 mA in .

The 2.46 mmNi Zn battery may provide current and power values of 1 to 2 mA and 1.2 to 2.6 mW which corresponds to 0.4 to 0.81 mA and 0.5 to 1.05 mW per each millimeter cube of volume of the cell. These values correspond to a power density of 500 to 1050 W L and an energy density of approximately 88 Wh L.

These values may be increased such as with increased pore density which may be obtained with a suitable mask in . A battery cell may be fabricated with a pore density of up to at least 80 .

Nickel micro tubes such as illustrated in were analyzed to verify that the tube walls were nickel and that the contents of the tubes were Ni OH or NiOOH rather than a potentially unusable form of nickel. The analysis included XPS and electrochemical techniques.

A nickel electrode filled with Ni OH NiOOH was analyzed with respect to electrochemical properties as described below with respect to .

An open circuit potential of the electrode was measured as 0.35 volts relative to a Hg HgO reference electrode which demonstrates that the chemicals inside the pores are Ni OH and NiOOH.

Relatively large currents during a voltage sweep of the CV demonstrates that the nickel metallization of the pores helps to conduct electrons toward and away from the Ni OH NiOOH mixture.

Zinc filled polycarbonate electrodes were also tested using SEM EDS and electrochemical techniques. The tests confirmed that the electrochemical deposition and impregnation procedures fill the pores in the polymer membrane with zinc and the electrode functions as a Zn Zn OH system.

As noted above a Ni Zn battery cell may be more environmentally friendly than a NiCad battery cell but also pose potential corrosion issues. As further noted above the potential corrosion issues with zinc were accommodated by metallizing pore walls with copper. With the resultant Ni Zn battery cell it was observed that the operating voltage is smaller by about 300 mV. A potential reason for this is discussed below.

The standard potential for reaction of a zinc electrode see equation 2 above is 1.35 V relative to a Hg HgO reference electrode. Immediately after fabrication the Zn Zn OH electrode had an open circuit potential Eof 1.35 V. Two hours later the Esettled at 0.9 V suggesting the electrode potential may have been influenced by the metal used in metalizing the pores in the polymer membrane namely copper. The drop in the E from 1.35 to 0.9 V affected the cell potential.
