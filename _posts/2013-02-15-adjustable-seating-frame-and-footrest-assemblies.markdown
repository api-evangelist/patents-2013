This Description merely describes exemplary embodiments and is not intended to limit the scope of the claims in any way. Indeed the invention as claimed is broader than and unlimited by the exemplary embodiments and the terms used in the claims have their full ordinary meaning.

As described herein when one or more components are described as being connected joined affixed coupled attached or otherwise interconnected such interconnection may be direct as between the components or may be indirect such as through the use of one or more intermediary components. Also as described herein reference to a member component or portion shall not be limited to a single structural member component or element but can include an assembly of components members or elements.

Wheelchairs are generally provided with leg support frame and footrest assemblies that are oriented to support standard or neutral skeletal alignment of the lower extremities e.g. pelvis legs ankles and feet . When a wheelchair user possesses moderate to severe skeletal deformities of these lower extremities for example due to birth defects accidents ailments or historic long term wheelchair use the resulting deviation from this neutral alignment often requires specialized or adapted components to enable the leg support frame and footrest assemblies to accommodate the user. These specialized adaptations e.g. a foot retaining box bolted to the footrest plate add cost size and complexity to the wheelchair and draw unwanted attention to the deformities of the user.

According to one aspect of the present application an adjustable seating frame and footrest assembly for a wheelchair is configured to accommodate a range of lower extremity positioning requirements of a wheelchair user. In one such embodiment a horizontally pivoting joint i.e. pivoting about a vertical axis between the side frame member and the footrest hanger allows for adjustable angular positioning of the entire footrest hanger for example to accommodate lower skeletal deformities of the user such as abduction adduction pelvic rotation leg length deforminity and or windswept legs.

While many different configurations may be utilized to provide adjustable angular positioning of a footrest hanger or some other seating frame component with respect to a wheelchair side frame member in an exemplary embodiment a first joint member is secured to the side frame member and a second joint member is secured to the footrest hanger with the second joint member being configured to be secured to the first joint member in a plurality of angular positions. In an exemplary embodiment first and second pivotally connected joint members are each provided with one or more lock apertures positioned such that in a selected angular position of the second joint member at least one of the one or more lock apertures of the first joint member aligns with at least one of the one or more lock apertures of the second joint member to receive at least one lock fastener through the aligned lock apertures. In one embodiment pivoting movement of the second joint member aligns a lock aperture in the first joint member with one of a plurality of lock apertures in the second joint member to provide for a plurality of angular positions of the second joint member. In another embodiment pivoting movement of the second joint member aligns a lock aperture in the second joint member with one of a plurality of lock apertures in the first joint member to provide for a plurality of angular positions of the second joint member. In still another embodiment each of the first and second joint members includes a plurality of lock apertures with at least one of the plurality of first joint member lock apertures aligning with at least one of the plurality of second joint member lock apertures in any of the available angular positions of the second joint member.

The first and second joint members each include pivot apertures that align to receive a pivot fastener e.g. a bolt or pin about which the second joint member is permitted to pivot to adjust an angular position of the second joint member with respect to the first joint member for example to adjust the orientation of a footrest mounted to the footrest hanger with respect to the side frame member . In a first angular position of the second joint member a first lock aperture of the first joint member aligns with a first lock aperture of the second joint member to receive a lock fastener which secures the second joint member in the first angular position. In a second angular position of the second joint member a second lock aperture of the first joint member aligns with a second lock aperture of the second joint member to receive the lock fastener or any other suitable lock fastener which secures the second joint member in the second angular position. In a third angular position of the second joint member a third lock aperture of the first joint member aligns with the second lock aperture of the second joint member to receive the lock fastener or any other suitable lock fastener which secures the second joint member in the third angular position.

As shown to accommodate multiple lock apertures on a relatively narrow joint member the first joint member may include at least one lock aperture proximal to a terminal end of the first joint member and at least one lock aperture distal to the terminal end of the first joint member and opposite the pivot aperture . Similarly the second joint member may include at least one lock aperture proximal to a terminal end of the second joint member and at least one lock aperture distal to the terminal end of the second joint member and opposite the pivot aperture .

To adjust the angular position of the second joint member with respect to the first joint member the lock fastener is removed from the aligned lock apertures or and the footrest hanger and second joint member are pivoted about the pivot fastener to a desired angular position coinciding with alignment of lock apertures of the first and second joint members . The lock fastener is installed through the newly aligned lock apertures or to secure the footrest hanger and second joint member in the selected angular position.

As described herein the lock apertures may be provided as holes extending through the joints as shown in . Alternatively other features such as notches blind bores counterbores slots or portions of slots may be utilized as lock apertures receiving at least a portion of a lock fastener. As one example not shown a slot having enlarged holes or cutouts corresponding to desired angular positions and sized to interlock with an enlarged lock fastener head may allow for adjustment of the angular position of the second joint member without complete removal of the lock fastener.

The adjustable seating frame and footrest assembly arrangements described above may be used with a variety of different wheel chair side frame members and footrest hangers. For example the side frame member may include a square rectangular circular or other cross sectioned tubular member attached to a first joint member. The footrest hanger may be permanently or releasably attached to the second joint member. In one embodiment a footrest hanger of a swing away configuration is mounted to the second joint member for pivotal movement about a vertical axis between a position in front of the chair and a position beside the chair. Examples of swing away footrest hanger configurations are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 854 774 and 4 790 553 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In another embodiment a footrest hanger having a spring loaded releasing mechanism may be releasably attached to a second joint member for easy detachment of the footrest hanger and footrest e.g. to facilitate stowing or transportation of the wheelchair. An example of a spring loaded releasing mechanism for a footrest hanger is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 155 586 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

While any suitable detachable engagement between the second joint member and the footrest hanger may be utilized in the illustrated embodiment the second joint member may be configured to engage the footrest hanger at three separate locations to provide additional support and rigidity for the footrest hanger. The exemplary second joint member includes a horizontal tubular section that retains a latch member biased outward of the horizontal section by a spring for interlocking engagement with a corresponding locking insert of a footrest hanger see . The second joint member further includes a vertical tubular section secured to the horizontal tubular section by a gusset for receiving a downward extending fitting of the footrest hanger . As shown in the second joint member may also include a support block fastened to the vertical tubular section e.g. by a fastener for supporting a horizontal brace that extends from the vertical portion of the footrest hanger and abuts the vertical tubular section . While the brace may be secured directly to the vertical portion in the illustrated embodiment the horizontal brace is provided on a tee member assembled with the vertical portion .

Referring to to lock the footrest hanger with the second joint member the downward extending fitting is inserted into the vertical tubular section of the second joint member and is pushed downward to compress a guide within the vertical tubular section against a spring . An angled surface of the locking insert engages a corresponding angled surface of the latch member to force the latch member against the spring and into the horizontal tubular section . When the insert angled surface is pushed past the latch member angled surface the latch member snaps outward under force of spring to interlock with the insert . In this locked position notches in the fitting receive a cross bolt extending through the vertical tubular section to impede rotation of the footrest hanger about the fitting . A contoured bumper at the end of the horizontal brace abuts the vertical tubular section and the support block engages an underside of the brace to further reinforce the attachment.

To release the footrest hanger from the second joint member a release lever pivotally connected to the gusset and attached to the latch member by a fastener extending through a slot in the horizontal tubular section is pivoted to retract the latch member out of interlocking engagement with the insert . The spring loaded guide then pushes the footrest hanger upward to allow rotation of the footrest hanger about the fitting and to facilitate separation of the footrest hanger from the second joint member .

The exemplary first and second joint members include overlapping semi cylindrical end portions shaped to allow for pivoting movement of the second joint member with respect to the first joint member. Similar to the schematically illustrated assembly of the first and second joint members each include pivot apertures that align to receive a pivot fastener e.g. a bolt or pin about which the second joint member is permitted to pivot to adjust an angular position of the second joint member with respect to the first joint member to adjust the orientation of a footrest mounted to the footrest hanger with respect to the side frame member . In a first neutral angular position of the second joint member a first lock aperture of the first joint member aligns with a first lock aperture of the second joint member to receive a lock fastener which secures the second joint member in the first angular position. In a second outward angular position of the second joint member a second lock aperture of the first joint member aligns with a second lock aperture of the second joint member to receive the lock fastener which secures the second joint member in the outward angular position. In a third inward angular position of the second joint member a third lock aperture not shown of the first joint member aligns with the second lock aperture of the second joint member to receive the lock fastener which secures the second joint member in the third angular position. While the joint members bay be configured to accommodate any suitable or desirable angular position of the of the footrest hanger in an exemplary embodiment the lock apertures of the first and second joint members are positioned to accommodate a straight neutral angular position an angled left position e.g. about 10 30 from neutral or about 22.5 from neutral and an angled right position e.g. about 10 30 from neutral or about 22.5 from neutral .

While the pivot fastener and lock fastener may include any suitable fasteners in an exemplary embodiment either or both of the fasteners are threaded fasteners configured to be tightened with threaded portions of the corresponding pivot apertures and or lock apertures to provide a sturdy robust attachment between the side frame member and the footrest hanger and footrest plate components that may be routinely subjected to substantial forces and impacts during use of the wheelchair.

To adjust the angular position of the second joint member with respect to the first joint member the lock fastener is removed from the aligned lock apertures the pivot fastener is loosened and the footrest hanger and second joint member are pivoted about the pivot fastener to a desired angular position coinciding with alignment of lock apertures of the first and second joint members . The lock fastener is installed through the newly aligned lock apertures to secure the footrest hanger and second joint member in the selected angular position.

According to another aspect of the present application a footrest plate may be adjustably secured to a footrest hanger for example to accommodate a variety of foot positions including non standard foot positions resulting from skeletal deformities of the legs ankles and feet. While the footrest plate may be hingedly attached to the footrest hanger for adjustment of a forward rearward proximal distal or swivel left right angle of the footrest plate in an exemplary embodiment a footrest assembly is provided with a ball and socket joint arrangement configured to provide for secure positioning of the footrest plate in any combination of forward toe down rearward toe up lateral up proximal up and swivel positions for example to accommodate planar flexion dorsal flexion inversion and eversion ankle and foot positioning requirements.

In the exemplary embodiment of a footrest plate mounting assembly includes a footrest plate mounting bracket secured to the footrest hanger for example by a fastener installed through a mounting hole in the bracket aligned with selected holes in the vertical portion of the footrest hanger . As shown the mounting bracket may include an enlarged U shaped attachment portion to provide rigid support between the footrest hanger and the mounting bracket . In other embodiments not shown the mounting bracket attachment portion may be contoured or otherwise configured to allow the mounting bracket to be pivoted or folded upward for example to facilitate storage or transportation of the wheelchair. The mounting bracket includes a concave spherical surface sized and shaped to receive a ball portion of a ball joint . As shown in a stem portion of the ball joint is secured to the footrest plate such that the position of the footrest plate is adjustable by moving the ball joint with respect to the mounting bracket . While the stem portion of the ball joint may be affixed directly to the footrest plate in the illustrated embodiment the stem portion is affixed e.g. welded to an adapter plate which may be secured to the footrest plate in a variety of positions thereby allowing the lateral and or longitudinal position of the footrest plate with respect to the footrest hanger to be adjusted within a plane defined by the footrest plate. In the illustrated example the footrest plate includes mounting slots that may be positioned with respect to corresponding mounting holes in the adapter plate with mounting bolts or other suitable fasteners installed through the aligned slots and holes to secure the footrest plate in the selected position. As shown the mounting slots may be provided with chamfered edges for seating engagement with a chamfered head on the bolts. As shown the footrest plate may include additional mounting holes for further attachment e.g. with additional bolts when aligned with corresponding mounting holes in the adapter plate and or for attachment of other accessories such as for example foot retaining straps or guards.

To secure the ball joint in a selected position with respect to the footrest plate mounting bracket as shown in a collar or other suitable clamping member is assembled with the mounting bracket over the ball portion of the ball joint thereby capturing the ball portion between the collar and the mounting bracket. The collar may but need not include a spherical concave surface to closely receive the ball portion of the ball joint. Fasteners attaching the collar to the mounting bracket through aligned mounting holes are tightened to apply a clamping or gripping force on the ball portion thereby securing the ball joint against additional movement. To adjust the position of the ball joint with respect to the mounting bracket the collar is loosened e.g. by loosening the fasteners to reduce the gripping force on the ball portion . As shown in the collar may include a slotted portion allowing the collar to be installed and removed from around the stem portion of the ball joint.

To improve the clamping grip on the ball portion at least an outer portion of the ball portion may be provided in a compressible material e.g. a rubber coating thereby providing for a more uniform grip between the ball portion and the concave spherical surfaces of the mounting bracket and collar . In another embodiment a footrest assembly may additionally or alternatively include mounting bracket and or collar concave surfaces that include compressible materials.
