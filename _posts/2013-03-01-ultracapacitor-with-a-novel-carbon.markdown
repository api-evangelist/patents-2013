At least portions of this invention were made using U.S. government funding provided by the National Science Foundation under grant number DMR 0907324 and by the Department of Energy under grant number ER46657. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure relates to capacitors and specifically to carbon materials that can be used in capacitors.

The increasing demand for electrical energy requires continuous development of improved energy storage technologies. Batteries store and release energy via chemical reactions but have limited storage capabilities. While batteries can achieve high energy density values discharge rates are typically limited by the chemical reactions. In contrast ultracapacitors do not rely on chemical reactions to release energy. As such ultracapacitors also referred to as supercapacitors can be charged and discharged rapidly.

Ultracapacitors also called supercapacitors or electrochemical capacitors are a potential solution for meeting the world s electrical energy storage needs. Vastly accelerated adoption of ultracapacitor technology now mainly based on porous carbons is currently limited by the low energy storage density and relatively high effective series resistance of these materials.

Ultracapacitors store energy by forming a double layer of electrolyte ions on the surface of conductive electrodes. Ultracapacitors are not limited by the electrochemical charge transfer kinetics of batteries and thus can operate at very high charge and discharge rates and can have lifetimes of over a million cycles however the energy stored in ultracapacitors is currently an order of magnitude lower than batteries. The limited energy storage of ultracapacitors limits their use to those applications that require high cycle life and power density. The energy density of conventional state of the art ultracapacitor devices mainly based on porous activated carbon AC is about 4 5 Wh Kg while that of lead acid batteries is in the range 26 34 Wh Kg. A conventional AC material with a specific surface area SSA in the range of 1 000 2 000 m g and a pore size distribution in the range of 2 5 nm can have a gravimetric capacitance of 100 120 F g in an organic electrolyte. Significant research has thus been focused on increasing energy density without sacrificing cycle life or high power density.

Thus there is a need to address the problems and other shortcomings associated with existing ultracapacitor technology and carbon materials for use therein. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the compositions and methods of the present disclosure.

In accordance with the purpose s of the invention as embodied and broadly described herein this disclosure in one aspect relates to capacitors and specifically to carbon materials that can be used in capacitors.

As briefly discussed above the present disclosure provides a carbon material that can be used in a capacitor such as for example an ultracapacitor.

Ultracapacitors also called supercapacitors or electrochemical capacitors are a potential solution to meeting the world s electrical energy storage needs. Vastly accelerated adoption of ultracapacitor technology now mainly based on porous carbons is currently hindered by their low energy storage density and relatively high effective series resistance. The present disclosure provides in various aspects a new carbon material obtained through the chemical activation of microwave exfoliated graphite oxide MEGO . In one aspect this new type of carbon hereinafter referred to as activated MEGO or a MEGO has at least one of a high surface area of up to about 3 100 m g or more a high electrical conductivity a low O and H content with strong evidence of primarily spbonding a novel pore structure or a combination thereof. In another aspect the carbon material or a portion thereof can be a negative curvature carbon allotrope. In another aspect two electrode ultracapacitor cells constructed with a MEGO electrodes and ionic liquid IL electrolytes can yield significantly higher gravimetric capacitance than other conventional electrode materials used with ionic liquid electrolytes with energy and power densities exceeding those of commercially available ultracapacitors by a factor of at least about 4 and 10 respectively.

Ultracapacitors store energy by forming a double layer of electrolyte ions on the surface of conductive electrodes. Ultracapacitors are not limited by the electrochemical charge transfer kinetics of batteries and thus can operate at very high charge and discharge rates and can have lifetimes of over a million cycles however the energy stored in conventional ultracapacitors can be about an order of magnitude lower than batteries. Such lower energy storage values can limit the adoption of ultracapacitors to applications that require high cycle life and power density. In one aspect the energy density of conventional ultracapacitor devices mainly based on porous activated carbon AC is about 4 5 Wh Kg while that of lead acid batteries is in the range 26 34 Wh Kg. A conventional AC material with a SSA in the range of 1 000 m g to 2 000 m g and a pore size distribution in the range of 2 nm to 5 nm can have a gravimetric capacitance of 100 120 F g in organic electrolytes. A significant amount of research has been focused on increasing energy density for ultracapacitor materials without sacrificing cycle life or high power density. For example capacitance increases have been reported in the organic electrolyte tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate TEA BF in acetonitrile AN using carbide derived carbons CDCs with sub nanometer pores. The capacitance increases can be attributed to the partial or complete desolvation of ions in the sub nanometer pores. Metal oxides such as RuOor MnO MoO and electronically conducting polymers or their composites have also been used to increase specific capacitance via pseudo capacitive redox reactions. Although capacitances of up to 1 300 F g e.g. with MnO have been reported in aqueous electrolytes the low electrical conductance poor compatibility with organic electrolytes and short cycle life have limited the practical application of these pseudo capacitive materials. Carbon nanotubes CNTs especially single walled CNTs SWNTs have an ideal limit SSA of 1 300 m g and can have high electrical conductance along the tubes and can demonstrate good performance in organic electrolyte however the high cost for mass production of high quality SWNTs can be a challenge for the commercialization of SWNT based ultracapacitors.

Graphene has a theoretical SSA of 2 630 m g and a very high intrinsic in plane electrical conductivity as well as high mechanical strength and chemical stability. Graphene based materials derived from graphite oxide GO can also be manufactured in industrial quantities at relatively low cost. Graphene can be made using any of a variety of known methods. Specific methods for obtaining chemically modified graphene are also disclosed in Park and Ruoff Chemical methods for the production of graphenes 29 March 2009 incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of disclosing graphene synthetic methods. In various aspects graphene can be produced by reducing graphene oxide with a reducing agent. Example reducing agents include anhydrous hydrazine hydrazine monohydrate dimethyl hydrazine sodium borohydride hydroquinone alkaline solutions and alcohols. Hydrogenation hydrogen transfer techniques employing small molecule reduced species as hydrogen sources and graphene oxide as the hydrogen sink may also be used. Catalysts such as tris tripenylphosphine rhodium chloride can optionally be used as activators of hydrogen that is produced during oxidation of a hydrogen source.

Ultracapacitors based on reduced graphene oxide with capacitance values of approximately 130 F g in aqueous KOH or 100 F g in organic electrolytes have been developed. Other graphene based materials derived from GO can have high end capacitance values of 200 F g in aqueous electrolytes 120 F g in organic electrolytes and 75 F g in an ionic liquids. In addition to these materials high frequency ultracapacitors prepared from oriented graphene grown on nickel surfaces can provide efficient filtering of 120 Hz current with an RC time constant of less than 0.2 ms but such performance is at the cost of low effective energy storage due to the very low density of the electrode material.

While much research has been conducted SSA values for carbon materials derived from GO remain substantially less than 2 630 m g. In one aspect the present disclosure provides an activation method with for example KOH for processing microwave exfoliated graphite oxide MEGO and or thermally exfoliated graphite oxide TEGO to achieve SSA values up to about 3 100 m g or more. Under the inventive processing conditions an activated MEGO a MEGO material can be obtained. In one aspect the inventive a MEGO is a novel carbon with a unique porous structure and can yield very high gravimetric capacitance values low ESR values in commercially available ionic liquid and or organic electrolytes or a combination thereof.

In various aspects the inventive process simultaneously increases the surface area accessible by electrolyte ions while maintaining the high electrical conductivity resulting in high energy and power density in two electrode ultracapacitor cells. In another aspect a new type of highly porous carbon is generated that is not graphene. In yet another aspect the inventive carbon can be similar in structure to negative curvature carbon .

In various aspects chemical activation such as for example KOH activation can provide an a MEGO material having improved porosity. In another aspect if used in a supercapacitor a resulting a MEGO material can enable the supercapacitor to having enhanced performance as compared to supercapacitors comprising conventional materials.

In one aspect a MEGO powder can be prepared by exposing GO to microwave energy. In one aspect the microwave energy can be from about 300 MHz to about 300 GHz. In another aspect the microwave energy can be from about 1 to about 10 GHz. In a specific aspect the microwave energy can be about 2.45 GHz. The source of microwave energy can be any source suitable for use in the methods of the present disclosure. In various aspects a microwave source can comprise a magnetron klystron gyrotron field effect transistor tunnel diode Gunn diode IMPATT diode or a combination thereof. In a specific aspect a MEGO powder can be prepared by irradiating GO in a conventional e.g. domestic microwave oven. The intensity of the microwave energy can also vary depending upon for example the specific material and degree of expansion desired. In one aspect the microwave energy is from about 100 to about 2 500 W or from about 700 to about 1 500 W. In addition the length of time for which a material is subjected to microwave irradiation can vary. In one aspect the intensity of the microwave radiation and or the length of time for which the material is exposed to the microwave energy is sufficient to at least partially expand the GO powder. In another aspect the length of time can be at least about 10 seconds for example about 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 200 300 or more seconds. In a specific aspect a GO powder can be exposed to microwave radiation of about 2.45 GHz and about 1 100 W for a period of about 1 minute. GO materials be prepared using known methods and one of skill in the art could readily prepare a suitable GO material for use in the methods of the present disclosure.

Following irradiation the MEGO powder can be contacted with an activator after which the powder can optionally be filtered and dried. In one aspect the resulting material is a mixture of MEGO and an activator such as for example MEGO KOH that can be chemically activated. In another aspect the mixture of MEGO and activator does not have to be filtered and or dried prior to a heat treatment step as described herein.

In one aspect the activator can comprise a basic material such as for example KOH or an aqueous solution thereof. In another aspect the activator can comprise a redicing agent. In still other aspects an activator can comprise one or more other compounds suitable for use in preparing an activated MEGO material. In various aspects an activator can comprise zinc chloride aluminium chloride magnesium chloride boric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid potassium hydroxide sodium hydroxide or a combination thereof.

After contacting MEGO with an activator and optionally filtering and drying the mixture can be subjected to a heat treatment step. In one aspect the heat treatment step can comprise exposing the mixture to a flowing stream of an inert and or a reducing gas at elevated temperature for a period of time. In one aspect the gas comprises argon. In other aspects the gas or mixture of gases can comprise other inert and or reducing gases. In another aspect the environment e.g. furnace tube can be held at a negative pressure for a period of time for example about 600 Torr 500 Torr 400 Torr 300 Torr 200 Torr 100 Torr or less. In still other aspects the temperature of a heat treatment step can vary depending on the degree of activation desired and the specific materials being processed. In one aspect the temperature is a temperature sufficient to at least partially activate the MEGO material. In another aspect the temperature can vary if different gases are used. In other aspects the duration of a heat treatment step can be from about 30 minutes to about 5 hours for about 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 or 5 hours. Ina specific aspect a heat treatment step can be from about 1 to about 2 hours. In other aspects a heat treatment step can be less than about 0.5 hours or greater than about 5 hours and the present invention is not intended to be limited to any particular length of time for a heat treatment step. One of skill in the art and in possession of this disclosure could readily determine appropriate activation conditions for preparation of an a MEGO material.

In one aspect the MEGO and or mixture of MEGO and base e.g. MEGO KOH can be positioned in a tube furnace under for example a flowing argon stream at a pressure of about 400 Torr. The mixture can then be heated at about 800 C. for about one hour. illustrates an exemplary schematic of an activation process as described herein. While not wishing to be bound by theory the chemical activation process can occur according to the following reaction scheme 6KOH C2K 3H 2KCO followed by the at least partial decomposition of KCOand or reaction of K KCO COwith carbon.

In one aspect phosphoric acid can be used for activation wherein the acid reacts with the carbon source at temperature less than 450 C. leading to what has described as C C bond weakening and formation of a cross linked structure. This likely reduces the release of volatile materials lowers the activation temperature and increases the carbon yield.

In another aspect after activation at least a portion of the activated MEGO is not graphene. In still another aspect after activation the MEGO material is not grapheme but rather has a unique structure as described herein.

In another aspect illustrates the microstructure of an exemplary a MEGO material prepared as described herein. Similarly illustrate C high resolution SEM D annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy ADF STEM and E F high resolution TEM HR TEM images of the microstructure of the a MEGO material. It should be noted that different starting materials and reaction conditions can produce a MEGO materials have varying microstructure. As such the figures and descriptions herein are intended to be exemplary but not limiting with respect to the materials and methods of the present disclosure. The images in illustrate an etched MEGO microstructure with a three dimensional distribution of mesopores.

In one aspect chemical activation can generate a plurality of pores in the carbon material. In one aspect the pore distribution and specific surface area can play significant roles in high gravimetric capacitance values and the types of surfaces that are present and accessible to the electrolyte are likely critically important to good compatibility with a wide range of electrolytes with different ion sizes such as the ILs and the organic electrolytes described herein.

In another aspect chemical activation can generate a three dimensional network of pores in the carbon material. In another aspect all or a portion of the pores generated in the carbon material can comprise mesopores. In another aspect at least a portion of the pores generated in the carbon material can have a diameter of from less than about 1 nm to about 10 nm. In other aspects at least a portion of the pores can be smaller than 1 nm or greater than 10 nm and the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to any particular pore size and or distribution. In another aspect the SSA of the resulting material can be controlled by varying the ration of MEGO to base and or reducing agent. For example illustrates exemplary SSA values obtainable by varying the KOH MEGO ratio.

While not wishing to be bound by theory chemical activation can in one aspect at least partially digest the MEGO material. In another aspect chemical activation can restructure at least a portion of the MEGO material. It should be noted that statistical quantitation of the resulting pores by electron microscopy techniques can be difficult.

In one aspect chemical activation can produce an a MEGO material having a dense pore structure wherein at least a portion of the walls of the pores comprise curved carbon sheets. In another aspect at least a portion of these curved carbon wall sheets are a single layer thickness.

In another aspect an a MEGO material can be comprised of a plurality of n membered rings in plane where n varies between about 5 and about 8. As illustrated in the exit wave reconstructed image of the in plane cystallinity can in various aspects be preserved even as the sheets bend through relatively high degrees of curvature.

The chemically activated a MEGO material can in one aspect have a BET surface area of up to about 3 100 m g for example about 1 000 1 200 1 300 1 500 1 800 2 000 2 200 2 400 2 600 2 800 3 000 3 100 m g or more.

In another aspect the chemically activated a MEGO can exhibit a high electrical conductivity such as for example up to about 500 S m or more. In various aspects an a MEGO material can have a powder electrical conductivity of about 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 S m or more. In yet another aspect the chemically activated a MEGO can exhibit a low oxygen content a low hydrogen content or a combination thereof. In various specific aspects an a MEGO material can have a C O atomic ratio of up to about 35 for example about 20 24 26 28 30 32 34 35 or greater. In another aspect an a MEGO material can have a hydrogen content less than about 0.5 wt. or less than about 0.3 wt. . In another aspect an a MEGO material can have a hydrogen content less than the threshold detection limit by elemental analysis.

In yet another aspect at least a portion of a chemically activated a MEGO material comprises spcarbon.

In still other aspects at least a portion of an a MEGO material can comprise a low for example ppm level unpaired spin count as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance EPR as illustrated in . When combined with the low concentration of oxygen and hydrogen atoms the EPR data indicates that a MEGO materials have a small fraction of edge atoms.

As noted briefly above a MEGO prepared in accordance with the methods described herein can in one aspect be comprised primarily of single carbon sheets. Other analyses of a MEGO materials such as synchrotron powder X ray diffraction XRD and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy are consistent with images obtained via HR TEM indicating predominately single carbon sheets. Specifically the XRD and XPS studies show a reduced intensity for the 002 peak. The low angle scatter observed for a MEGO materials as compared to MEGO not activated is also consistent with the presence of a high density of pores in the a MEGO material. The C1s region of the XPS spectrum for a MEGO material illustrates a tail between about 286 eV and about 290 eV that in one aspect can be attributed to C O groups and energy loss shake up features. In the activated material a MEGO the presence of such oxygen containing groups was suppressed with two new peaks appearing between about 292 eV and about 296 eV. These new peaks can be attributed to potassium residue primarily as KCOwith a small amount of KOH. Thus if other bases and or reducing agents other than KOH are used the resulting XPS spectra will vary.

In one aspect quantification of the amount of sp bonding can be determined by measuring the ratio between bonding and bonding using for example electron energy loss spectroscopy EELS . illustrates a comparison of the carbon K near edge structure for both a MEGO and graphite samples of equivalent thickness. Assuming 100 spbonding in the graphite reference spectra the a MEGO sample can have about 98 2 spbonding. Complementary measurements can also be made by XPS providing similar results. In addition micro Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques can be utilized to reinforce and understand the specific structure of a particular a MEGO material.

As noted above MEGO materials can exhibit a distribution of pores after chemical activation. In one aspect adsorption experiments can be performed to characterize the surface and pore size distribution of a MEGO material after chemical activation. illustrates data obtained from coupling nitrogen 77.4 K and argon 87.3 K adsorption desorption experiments with advanced methods based on density functional theory together with CO 273.2 K adsorption experiments employed to assess ultramicropores i.e. pores having a width of less than about 1 nm . The isotherms from these experiments can reveal details of the low pressure region where micropore filling occurs as well as pore condensation and type H2 hysteresis. In one aspect the experimental data from a MEGO samples indicates an interconnected pore system with constrictions. In contrast illustrates data obtained from similar analysis of a MEGO unactivated control sample indicating a significantly smaller pore volume than that obtained for the a MEGO material. In one aspect and while not wishing to be bound by theory the smaller pore volume can be attributed to the platelet like structure in MEGO materials whereas the pores in a MEGO materials can exhibit a well defined micro mesopore size distribution as in with a significant increase in pore volume of up to about 2.14 cm g relative to MEGO materials.

In one aspect the obtained pore size volume distribution indicates that a MEGO is a unique material because of the existence of well defined micro and mesopores. In another aspect a MEGO can exhibit micropores having a width of about 1 nm as well as narrow mesopores with an average width of about 4 nm. further illustrates the pore size distribution of an exemplary a MEGO material calculated using a quenched solid density functional theory QSDFT which can account for surface roughness of the material.

In various aspects the inventive a MEGO material can be utilized as a component of an electrode for example in a supercapacitor. Supercapacitor designs and electrode designs for use in supercapacitors are known and one of skill in the art could readily select an appropriate supercapacitor electrode and or cell design for use with the compositions and methods of the present invention. In a supercapacitor a voltage potential can be applied across the electrodes of the supercapacitor such that one electrode becomes positively charged and the other becomes negatively charged. Negatively charged ions in the electrolyte cover the surfaces of the positively charged electrode while positively charged ions in the electrolyte cover the surfaces of the negatively charged electrode a result of the aforementioned electrostatic interactions.

In one aspect a supercapacitor comprises one or more graphene based electrodes an electrolyte and a dielectric separator that can divide the supercapacitor into two chambers wherein each of the two chambers comprises an electrode and a portion of electrolyte. In another aspect the electrolyte is an ionic liquid and or comprises an ionic liquid.

Ionic liquids are typically salts that melt at temperatures below 100 C. They are typically composed of discrete ions or loosely associated ions each of which offers a unique set of materials properties. These properties can be unavailable from neutral organic compounds crystalline inorganic salts or common solvents such as water. Ionic liquids can exhibit suitable aspects of one or more of the following properties high conductivity high chemical stability high thermal stability or high electrochemical stability large electrochemical window low melting point low viscosity low vapor pressure and volatility high environmental stability low toxicity low cost ease of scalability and purification. In various aspects an ionic liquid can be used at high potentials such as for example 2.0 V or higher.

In one aspect the melting point of an ionic liquid can be decreased by using liquids with lower anion cation interactions or with more diffuse charge structures. Melting points can also be decreased by for example using asymmetric ionic liquids as well as by introducing various types of synthetic oligomers or polymers as pendant functionalities.

In another aspect the viscosity of an ionic liquid can be decreased by the presence of perfluorinated anions and oligomer or polymer substituents. Linked moieties possessing multiple charged components can also lower viscosity while simultaneously increasing thermal stability.

In yet another aspect the electrochemical window of ionic liquids can be broadened by adding fluorinated alkyl chains to the cation. In some aspects this can cause dramatic differences in the local electronic environments. The anions can be fluorinated anions such as for example bistriflimide or a dicyanamide anion.

In still another aspect the thermal stability of an ionic liquid can be increased by linking multiple charged groups together or through the use of fluorinated components. Reactivity as a function of temperature can also be used to select ionic liquids that are more thermally stable at ultracapacitor operation and or storage temperatures.

In one aspect any suitable ionic liquid based electrolyte can be used in conjunction with one or more electrodes in an electrochemical cell. In various aspects these can comprise ionic liquids with ammonium cations imidazolium cations or a combination thereof.

In yet another aspect an ionic liquid can comprise a N methyl N alkyl pyrrolidinium bistriflimide. In various aspects an ionic liquid can comprise pyrrolidinium salts as cations wherein the inclusion of a longer alkyl chain can decrease the melting point of the ionic liquid. In an exemplary aspect an octyl functionalized cation can have a melting point of about 15.2 C. In another aspect a cation anion combination with a desired melting point can be selected by one of skill in the art. In other aspects an ionic liquid can be a pyrrolidinium based ionic liquid having a melting point lower than about 10 C. a non pyrrolidinium based cyclic ammonium a phosphonium based cyclic ammonium or a combination thereof.

In other aspects an ionic liquid can be a spirocyclic ammonium or phosphonium based ionic liquid. In still other aspects an ionic liquid can comprise an acyclic ammonium or phosphonium based ionic liquid. In still other aspects an ionic liquid can comprise a combination of one or more ionic liquids recited herein or otherwise known in the art.

In other aspects the ionic liquid is a mixture of two or more ionic liquids and or a mixture of an ionic liquid and another non ionic electrolyte. In one aspect an organic electrolyte can comprise TEA BFin AN electrolyte. In still other aspects an organic electrolyte can comprise other species or mixtures of species not recited herein.

In a specific aspect an ammonium based ionic liquid comprising N N diethyl N methyl N 2 methoxyethyl ammonium bis trifluoromethanesulfonyl amide can be used. This composition is non flammable operates in a wide potential window 5.4 V and has a high ionic conductivity 4.0 mS cm at 30 C. . In still other aspects an ionic liquid or mixture of ionic liquids can exhibit high electrochemical stability such as for example that or quarternary ammonium salts and or pyrrolidinium salts. In one aspect an ionic liquid can comprise from about 1 wt. to about 100 wt. of an electrolyte for example about 1 2 3 4 5 7 9 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 34 36 38 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 .

In another aspect an electrolyte can comprise HSO.

In other aspects an electrolyte can comprise an ionic liquid or mixture of ionic liquids and another non ionic liquid such as an exogenous solvent. In such an aspect the other liquid can be present in various amounts and can help render the viscosity or melting point of the electrolyte as a whole suitable for a particular ultracapacitor. For example 10 wt acetonitrile can be used in an electrolyte when a triflate ionic liquid is used as triflate containing ionic liquids can be tacky solids at room temperature. While acetonitrile can have a deleterious effect of dilution in an ionic liquid it can significantly decrease the viscosity and melting point of the mixture as compared to ionic liquid alone. In various aspects the melting point of a mixture can be decreased to nearly that of the solvent alone e.g 45 C. . In such an aspect a decreased melting point and increased electrolyte viscosity can improve the ultracapacitor performance as a whole because it can facilitate greater ion mobility allowing faster and more efficient charging and discharging.

In yet other aspects an ionic liquid can be anhydrous or substantially anhydrous before it is disposed in an supercapacitor after it is assembled into the supercapacitor or both. In aspects where the ionic liquid is anhydrous after assembly into the supercapacitor any residual water content of materials used in the electrodes can be sufficiently low to preserve the anhydrous or substantially anhydrous state of the ionic liquid. In one aspect an anhydrous ionic liquid can have a water content of less than about 10 ppm for example less than about 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 or 1 ppm. In other aspects an anhydrous liquid can have a sufficiently low concentration of water so as to avoid detectable hydrolysis products in a supercapacitor during the life of the supercapacitor.

Such an electrode can in various aspects be used in conjunction with electrolytes containing propylene carbonate or acetonitrile or ionic liquids discussed later or a combination thereof.

In one aspect an a MEGO material having a SSA of about 1 280 m g can exhibit a capacitance of about 122 F g when used in a BMIM BF AN electrolyte. In an exemplary aspect to evaluate the performance of a MEGO materials in electrodes two electrode symmetrical supercapacitor cells were constructed based on an a MEGO material having a SSA of about 2 400 m g and BMIM BF AN electrolyte. illustrates cyclic voltammetry analysis of the cells showing rectangular curves from 0 V to 3.5 V over a wide range of scan rates. Similarly illustrates galvanostatic charge discharge curves with specific capacitance values of 165 F g at 1.4 A g 166 F g at 2.8 A g and 166 g at 5.7 A g . When expressed in volumetric terms the exemplary a MEGO samples had a capacitance of about 60 F cm. Moreover at the initiation of discharge the a MEGO sample exhibited a voltage drop of 0.034 V iof 1.4 A g indicating a very low ESR in the test cell. In another aspect analysis of the frequency response over the range from 500 kHz to 5 mHz produced the Nyquist plot shown in . The plot features a vertical curve indicating a nearly ideal capacitive behavior of the cell.

In further analysis of the a MEGO sample the voltage drop at the beginning of discharge curves was used to estimate the internal resistance wherein an ESR of 3.2 was obtained from a MEGO in BMIM BF AN electrolyte. Based on a series RC model the capacitance from the frequency response data as a function of frequency is shown in .

In one aspect capacitance of the a MEGO in BMIM BF AN electrolyte can decrease sharply at about 4 Hz and remains at about 0.035 F at 10 Hz. Performance of the same a MEGO material in TEA BF AN electrolyte was evaluated where a specific capacitance greater than 150 F g was obtained from a discharge curve with a constant 0.8 A g current and an ESR or 4.62 . In one aspect the inventive a MEGO material can exhibit the highest gravimetric capacitance known to date in an organic electrolyte for any carbon derived from graphene based materials. In another aspect energy and power density can be estimated based on measurements of the supercapacitor test cell in BMIM BF AN electrolyte. Using the specific capacitance value of 166 F g from the discharge curve with a constant current of 5.7 A g and a working voltage of 3.5 V the energy density of an a MEGO material can be about 70 Wh kg. In other aspects the energy density of an a MEGO material can be at least about 60 at least about 70 at least about 75 at least about 80 Wh kg or more.

At the same current density 5.7 A g the power density can be about 250 kW kg as estimated by using the voltage drop and ESR obtained from the discharge curve. For a packaged cell the power density of 75 kW kg is one order higher than the values from commercial carbon supercapacitors that have energy density values of 4 5 Wh kg. In other aspects an a MEGO material in an electrochemical cell can exhibit a power density of at least about 200 at least about 225 at least about 250 at least about 275 at least about 300 kW kg or more.

This material is also very stable. After 10 000 constant current charge discharge cycles at a current density of 2.5 A g in neat BMIM BFelectrolyte 97 of its capacitance was retained.

In one aspect the performance of a MEGO can be higher when used with small diameter ions. For example when used with EMIM TFSI electrolyte the measured gravimetric capacitance of a MEGO SSA 3100 m g at 3.5 V and a current density of 0.7 A g is 200 F g with an ESR of 8.6 . However the curves in are not as ideal as those from a MEGO in either BMIM BF AN or TEA BF AN electrolyte.

In one aspect the two electrode supercapacitor cells constructed with a MEGO electrodes showed a higher gravimetric capacitance in AN based electrolytes than any other carbon derived from graphene based materials.

In one aspect the energy density for an ionic liquid based fully packaged cell for example 1 Ethyl 3 methylimidazolium bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide EMIM TFSI can be about 25.5 Wh Kg or about the same as that of a conventional lead acid battery.

Graphite oxide GO powders made from the modified Hummers method were irradiated in a domestic microwave oven GE JES0736SM1SS operated at 1100 W for 1 minute. During the irradiation a large volume expansion of the GO powder occurred and the black fluffy MEGO powder obtained was collected for activation. Typically 400 mg MEGO powder was dispersed in 20 ml 7M aqueous KOH solution and stirred for 4 hours at a speed of 400 rpm followed by another 20 hours of static soaking in ambient conditions. The extra KOH solution was removed by briefly filtering the mixture through a polycarbonate membrane Whatman 0.2 m then the mixture was dried in the lab environment at 65 C. for 24 hours. A control MEGO sample made with the same soaking drying process but with no KOH was also prepared and 85 of the mass remained after drying. A KOH to MEGO ratio was calculated by assuming the MEGO in the dry MEGO KOH mixture gave the same mass yield i.e. 85 .

It was found that the KOH uptake KOH MEGO ratio was linearly dependent on the molarity of the KOH solution with other process parameters held constant such as the amount of MEGO from the same batch of GO and the volume of KOH solution . For the MEGO soaked in 20 ml 7M KOH as described above the KOH MEGO ratio was 8.9 0.3. The dry MEGO KOH mixture was heated at 800 C. for 1 hour in a horizontal tube furnace 50 mm diameter with an argon flow of 150 sccm and working pressure of 400 Torr. The temperature was ramped from room temperature to 800 C. at 5 C. min.

After cooling down in vacuum the sample was repeatedly washed by de ionized water until a pH value of 7 was reached. Then the sample was dried at 65 C. in ambient for 2 hours followed by thermal annealing at 800 C. in vacuum 0.1 Torr for 2 hours to generate activated MEGO a MEGO powders. Thermally exfoliated graphite oxide TEGO made by thermal shocking of GO at 250 C. in ambient was activated following the same process. The a MEGO and a TEGO so obtained were characterized in a variety of ways and supercapacitor measurements were made as described in the main text and below.

Micro Raman was performed on a Witec Alpha 300 confocal Raman system with a laser wavelength of 532 nm. Lorentzian fitting was done to obtain the positions and widths of the D and G bands in the Raman shift spectra. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR was done with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum BX.

X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS was performed with two separate systems equipped with monochromatic Al K sources Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD Omicron Nanotechnology XM1000 EA 125 U7 to analyze the chemical composition of the samples. Combustion elemental analysis was performed at Atlantic Microlab Inc. Georgia USA for determination of the C O and H content. Electron paramagnetic resonance EPR measurements of a MEGO were done with a Bruker EMX Plus X band 295 K with 2 2 Di 4 tert octylphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl DPPH Sigma Aldrich 257612 as a standard.

Michigan USA the same graphite used to make the GO that was converted to MEGO MEGO and a MEGO samples respectively. High resolution SEM STEM and EELS were performed using a dedicated STEM Hitachi HD2700C equipped with a cold field emission gun a CEOS aberration corrector and a high resolution 0.35 eV EELS Spectrometer Gatan Enfina .

As noted above it was necessary to ignore the large percentage of the a MEGO on the TEM grid as it was too thick to perform EELS measurements on. It is possible to quantify the amount of sp bonding by measuring the ratio between bonding and bonding using EELS. The relative amount of spcarbon atoms was calculated by using the formula 

A two electrode cell configuration was used to measure the performance of supercapacitors with the a MEGO and a TEGO materials. 5 wt Polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE 60 wt dispersion in water was added to the a MEGO and a TEGO as a binder.

Typically the a MEGO or a TEGO and PTFE was mixed into a paste using a mortar and pestle rolled into uniform thickness sheets whose thickness ranged 40 to 50 m thick from sheet to sheet and punched into 1 cm diameter electrodes. A pair of typical electrodes had a weight between 2.5 and 4.0 mg after drying overnight at a 100 C. under vacuum. The two identical by weight and size electrodes were assembled in a test cell which consisted of two current collectors two electrodes and an ion porous separator Celgard 3501 supported in a test fixture consisting of two stainless steel plates. Conductive carbon coated aluminum foils Exopack 0.5 mil 2 6 side coating were used as current collectors. 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate BMIM BF was obtained commercially from Sigma Aldrich and diluted in acetonitrile AN with a weight ratio of 1 1 with some testing done with neat BMIM BF . The tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate TEA BF Sigma Aldrich was prepared at 1.0 M in AN.
