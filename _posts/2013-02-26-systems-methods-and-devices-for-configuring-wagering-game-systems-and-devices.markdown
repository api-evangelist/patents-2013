A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure as it appears in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present disclosure relates generally to wagering games as well as wagering game terminals and wagering game systems. More particularly the present disclosure relates to systems methods and devices for configuring wagering game machines wagering game terminals gaming systems portable gaming devices and the like.

Gaming terminals such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Thus gaming manufacturers continuously strive to develop new games and improved gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player.

There are three main types of wagering game machines mechanical electromechanical and electronic. The original slot machine for example was entirely mechanical in construction working on an elaborate configuration of springs gears shafts brakes and levers. Since its introduction in the early 1960 s the electromechanical gaming machine began replacing most if not all mechanical slot machines. Electromechanical gaming machines typically use one or more microprocessors to determine a random outcome and electrical stepper motors to spin and stop a set of mechanical reels. The electronic gaming machine EGM in comparison subsequently supplanted the mechanical reels of the electromechanical gaming machine with simulated mechanical reels generated by a video display device. In addition to slot type wagering games traditional table games such as poker blackjack keno and bingo were adapted for use on EGM s.

The use of microprocessors has significantly advanced the state of the art of electronic gaming. For instance microprocessors offer gaming machines much greater latitude in determining random game outcomes. Random game outcomes are typically determined by a random number generator RNG that is driven by a central processing unit CPU . A probability table contains all possible game outcomes with each game outcome being linked to a distinct number. Once generated the random number is used to look up the corresponding game outcome in the probability table. The CPU then signals the stepper motors to drive and position the reels to coincide with the randomly determined game outcome. Microprocessor driven EGM s allow gaming manufacturers to design slot games with more flexible pay tables. In a specific example microprocessor driven gaming machines can offer high value low probability awards while contemporaneously offering low value high probability awards offering a range of awards that an all mechanical slot machine cannot.

The increased power of modern microprocessors has enabled the introduction of new gaming machine capabilities that allow the addition of entirely new classes of features and functions. Many EGM designs allow these features and functions to be enabled in a variety of different combinations to operate on a wide variety of different technological platforms. Enabling these features oftentimes requires they be configured to casino specifications without departing from state gaming regulations when the EGM s are first set up on the casino floor. These configuration parameters can enable the gaming machine to network with the casino s existing central computer systems for example to coordinate with the casino s cashless gaming systems wagering processes accounting procedures player tracking data collection etc.

Networking a gaming machine to a gaming establishment s central computer system typically requires the machine be configured to establish communication including selection of communication protocols for communication between the gaming machine and host system. This may include selection of the host ports for electronic funds transfers establishing gaming machine communication addresses host communication protocol bonus control etc. As part of the initial set up process a number of configuration parameters may also be set to customize the gaming machine for example to comport with the wagering processes used by a particular gaming establishment. These specifications can include the selection of payout devices e.g. hopper ticket printer cashless player account etc. selection of payout options e.g. split pays from both the hopper and ticket printer and controlling ticket printer parameters. The gaming machine may also be configured to customize the presentation of the game. These configuration parameters can include in some non limiting examples screen brightness gaming machine lighting speaker volume presentation of multiple games payback percentages etc. Some additional miscellaneous configuration categories include ticket in control configuration validation control and gaming machine operating modes including demonstration and diagnostic mode . Within each of these categories can be a number of different selections and even sub selections.

The number and complexity of configuration parameters can require considerable technician time during the initial EGM set up process. Historically the configuration process required selecting and implementing operating parameters for each gaming machine the gaming machine was manually configured through an extensive set of administrative menus. Some parameters require multiple menus and value entries to be completely configured. For some electronic gaming machines the video display has a touch screen that can be used as an input device to configure the gaming machine. The technician is provided with instructions and options displayed on the video display for each configuration parameter and the technician selects configuration parameters using the touch screen. This can become a time consuming tedious and in some instances error prone process especially when numerous gaming machines must be configured.

Overcoming the problems associated with configuring hundreds if not thousands of gaming machines whether they are electromechanical or electronic gaming machines is an expensive time consuming process. This issue can be exacerbated when new gaming features and functions are introduced to the market or certain gaming machines are underperforming when compared to their counterparts and operators wish to configure reconfigure multiple gaming machines that are out on the casino floor. What is needed are new methods and devices for configuring wagering game machines to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the configuration process.

Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems methods and devices for configuring wagering game systems and devices. An administrative configuration system is disclosed which based upon one or more inputs from the operator or technician recommends configuration parameters to optimize machine performance for the given input s . To achieve optimal math setup the EGM can recommend values for one or more of the following configuration parameters game denomination denom payline count minimum bet maximum bet and hold percentage. In some configurations the operator is provided with an advanced setup feature which provides the ability to manually adjust one or more of the recommended configuration parameter values. Some embodiments may offer general wizard like functionality which walks the operator or technician through each step of configuration process rather than requiring the operator technician to traverse through various menus.

Also disclosed is an optional unified interface configuration module between the administration operation and maintenance AOM server s Mirador server s real time gaming RTG server s and the EGM. An abstracted cross platform EGM configuration application can be built and called up by different systems during configuration. Any system could then set the configuration parameters and transmit them to a standard application programming interface API . An advantage of this system is that updates improvements and or changes can more easily propagate from one system to another rather than having separate configuration implementations for each system. This approach can also offer more cross system consistency.

Other exchanged information may include data related to the various configuration parameters that affect the operation of a wagering game machine or the wagering game s presented on the wagering game machine. Examples of such configuration parameters may include one or more of the following 

As noted above wagering game machines A D may store and maintain various types of information including those types discussed in the preceding paragraphs. This data may be periodically sent to a host system or central gaming system e.g. corporate headquarters for use in generating configuration settings parameters for the wagering game machines. In some embodiments the data received from one or more wagering game machines may be stored in one or more databases such as databases A F. A configuration analysis component such as casino computers and or trend analysis computers can analyze the data from the database s and apply rules defined in a rule set to determine new configuration parameters to be applied to one or more wagering game machines based on the data and the rule set. By way of non limiting example the rule set may be defined such that wagering game machines that perform in the lowest 20 when compared to other wagering game machines are automatically reconfigured. For instance wagering game machines performing in the bottom 20 are reconfigured with configurations similar wagering game machines performing in the upper . Many other types of rules and combinations of rules are possible and within the scope of the inventive subject matter as will be developed in further detail below.

Rules related to machine performance may vary depending for example on the goals of the gaming establishment. If revenue maximization is a goal then the rules related to determining machine performance may use coin in as a base or primary measurement of performance. Alternatively if the casino wants to maximize occupancy in the short term in order to hopefully realize more revenue in the long term then rules based on occupancy data may be used in determining performance of a wagering game machine. Similarly rules associated with machine configurations may vary depending on the goals of the casino. If revenue maximization is a goal for example configurations designed to generate more revenue may be employed. Likewise if maximizing occupancy is a goal then configurations designed to provide maximum occupancy may be employed.

A rule set may be designed to take into account various factors when determining a configuration for one or more wagering game machines. For example the rules may be defined such that a particular mix of themes denominations and or wagering game types should be maintained perhaps in order to attempt to maximize occupancy and coin in and thus maximize revenue. Further the rules may take into account pairings of particular bonus rounds and particular wagering games pairings of wagering games or other combinations of bonus rounds themes episodes and wagering games that may result in increased revenue and or occupancy.

In some embodiments one or more of the databases A F maintains location data for each of the wagering game machines. This location data may then be used by a configuration analysis component such as casino computers and or trend analysis computers to determine the themes denominations line counts paylines max bet min bet hold percentage and or wagering game types that should be configured for wagering game machines in particular locations. Using location in determining a desired configuration may be preferable because it may be beneficial to locate certain themes denominations and or wagering game machine types in particular locations. For example it may be desirable to locate games having a similar theme in one location. Further it may be desirable to locate machines with particular denominations together and or in a particular location in a casino. Further it may be desirable to achieve a particular distribution of themes denominations or wagering game types across a casino floor. As will be developed in further detail below location data may also include geographic location such as a city state country or region of a country. It may be desirable to include such location data because wagering patterns may be different in different areas of a country or in different countries of the world.

Rules may also be time based. For example it may be desirable to create configurations based on a time of day day of week time of year or for special events that occur from time to time. For example it may be desirable to reconfigure denominations based on time of day with lower denominations used during the daytime and or during weekdays and higher denominations used at night time and or during weekends. Similarly certain events may make it desirable to adjust denominations paylines pay tables or other configuration parameters. By way of example and not limitation if a major boxing match is to occur on particular date it may be desirable to configure wagering game machines with higher denominations higher maximum bets and or higher line counts on the assumption that players that attend major boxing matches may also be willing to wager larger amounts.

Configuration analysis may also take configuration costs into account in determining a configuration or recommended configuration. Some configuration changes may be made at little or no cost to a gaming establishment while other configuration changes may come with a relatively high cost. For example configuration changes to paylines max min wager amounts or average payout i.e. payback percentage may be made at relatively little cost while a configuration change that requires a new game new bonus round or new episodic content may cost significant amounts of money to make e.g. game cost licensing fees etc. . Thus the configuration analysis component of some embodiments may measure the cost of a configuration change when determining what if any configuration changes may be used to improve the performance of one or more wagering game machines.

Configuration analysis may run in a number of different ways. In some embodiments a configuration analysis component may run continuously or automatically at particular times to reanalyze and generate new configurations based on current performance data. The new configurations may then be automatically sent to one or more wagering game machines. Alternatively the configuration analysis component may generate an alert message that may be sent to a casino operator alerting the operator that a new configuration has been generated. The operator may then review the configuration and confirm or modify the configuration before the configuration is sent to the wagering game machine s .

Optionally configuration analysis may be run in response to an operator or technician initiating a configuration analysis component. Upon initiation the configuration analysis component may analyze the available data and generate new recommended configurations for one or more wagering game machines. The configuration analysis component may then automatically initiate the new configuration or may display a suggested configuration and allow for modification and or confirmation via a user interface before automatically sending the configuration to one or more wagering game machines.

A rule set may be implemented as a set of heuristics that are encoded as instructions in a configuration analysis component. Heuristics refers to experience based techniques for problem solving learning and discovery. Where an exhaustive search is impractical heuristic methods are used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution e.g. the best approximate result . In some embodiments the rule set may be defined in a rules definition language that may be input or edited e.g. via a user interface. In further embodiments rules sets may include rules that are discovered or defined with the assistance of a relationship discovery process. Examples of such processes can include neural networks cluster analysis statistical analysis artificial intelligence methods or other analysis methods designed to discover relationships in data. Further details on such analysis methodologies and systems may be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0166940 A1 to Wayne H. Rothschild which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.

The user interface may be presented to a configuration workstation which may be communicatively coupled for example via a network to a central system. This workstation may be based in the gaming establishment or it may be offsite at a central operating system or at a third party responsible for administering configurations for the casino. For example the performance data may be generated at one or more casinos and sent to a third party for storage and analysis. The third party may then provide a recommended configuration for one or more wagering game machines. The user interface may invoke the configuration analysis component in order to have new configurations automatically generated. The user interface may provide interface elements such as drop down menus prompts popup menus instructions icons and buttons to allow a user to confirm modify or otherwise manipulate the generated configuration.

It may be desirable in at least some embodiments for the user interface to provide a selection mechanism allowing a user to select a template or default configuration from a set of templates defaults. These templates may provide predefined configurations or configuration rules that may be useful for certain situations such as when a casino is being set up for the first time and no performance data is available. Templates may be selected based on the anticipated characteristics of the casino or casino customer base. For example one template may be used if the customer base tends to wager high amounts while a different template may be used if the customer base tends to wager low amounts. Similarly templates may exist for high occupancy situations and other templates for low occupancy situations.

The user interface may present a wizard style interface that leads the operator through a series of questions designed to determine the characteristics of the casino and or casino customer base. After the questions have been answered the configuration analysis component may select a template or rule set that best matches the characteristics based on the answers provided by the user.

For some embodiments the user interface may allow a user to manually generate or modify a configuration parameter for one or more wagering game machines. As the user is entering a configuration parameter the entered value may be analyzed and if determined to not be compliant with predefined rule sets or contradictory to determinations made from available data suggest an alternative setting for the configuration parameter. For example a user may configure an electronic video slot machine with a 15 payline configuration. However configuration analysis may determine that a 20 payline configuration may be more likely to provide increased revenue. The user interface may then present a pop up window or other user interface element that provides a suggestion to use the alternative parameter.

With reference now to the flow chart of an improved method for configuring one or more gaming devices in a gaming system such as the gaming devices and systems shown in for example is generally described at in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. can be representative of an algorithm that corresponds to at least some instructions that can be stored for example in main memory of and executed for example by the CPU and or external system s of to perform any or all of the above or below described functions associated with the disclosed concepts. The method will be described with reference to the various aspects and features shown in the drawings such reference is being provided purely by way of explanation and clarification.

In some embodiments the method provides a learned recommendation for configuring a wagering game machine or a group of gaming machines. The method may act as a vehicle to disseminate knowledge and to tailor one or more gaming machines to a targeted player demographic. This is achieved in at least some of the disclosed concepts by learning the optimal configuration parameter s and based upon one or more inputs received from the operator suggesting changes that should be made to improve machine performance. By collecting values for a set of variables and then applying a set of heuristics to these values the method can find the best EGM configuration setup to fit those parameters.

At block the configuration process begins. For example when the EGM is first brought into service i.e. turned on for the first time on the gaming floor the operator can be automatically prompted to configure the EGM and the wagering game s available on that particular EGM. Once the EGM and game s are properly configured the EGM is made available to the public for play. As indicated above the configuration process may be conducted when the gaming machine is first installed on the gaming floor as just discussed and or at various times throughout its operational life.

When the EGM boots up the administrator enters a configuration screen. During the initial setup the administrator may be required to perform some basic administration functions as indicated at block . These administrative functions may include as some non limiting examples entering general client information e.g. name address etc. selecting the sound level selecting the display brightness setting emotive lighting etc.

During the configuration process the operator may need to set EGM wide parameters. In this regard the method may include at block determining if the EGM wide parameters are configured. If a determination is made that the EGM wide parameters are not configured Block No the method proceeds to block to configure the EGM wide parameters. For implementations where the administrator assists in configuring these parameters a series of menu screens with user selectable buttons may be displayed via the EGM such that the operator can set these parameters. The EGM wide parameters may include date and time configuration accounting and base denomination configuration peripheral device configuration etc. as listed in the data section in . For example an EGM may support running with different bill validators from different hardware manufactures. The operator may therefore be required to select from a predefined list the bill validator that is installed into the EGM hardware.

If the EGM wide parameters were already configured Block Yes or after the EGM wide parameters are configured e.g. via the administrator at Block the method proceeds to block to determine if one or more of the wagering games available on the EGM should be or need to be configured. In order to configure a game and thus make it available for play on the EGM the operator may first be required to select a game e.g. in instances where there are numerous games available on the EGM. In some embodiments multiple games can be selected and configured from a single EGM e.g. in a multigame setup. One or more of the recommended values for the configuration parameters of the EGM may be based on the selected wagering game s .

The configuration process for setting up a wagering game may include the operator selecting different game parameters e.g. entering desired values for various game configuration variables such as denomination payout percentage line count max bet min bet and which buttons on the EGM button panel activates which wagers. These selected parameters affect the pricing of the game and the math experience offered to the player when playing the wagering game. Put another way the game configuration variable typically affects the payback percentage of the wagering game e.g. how much it will cost the player to play the game. These parameters will oftentimes affect the performance of the EGM including how much money the EGM will bring in how much money it will payout the average time on device and the average expenditure per player per gaming session i.e. bankroll . In the illustrated example the system relies on the administrator of the EGM to set some of these configuration parameters.

With continuing reference to block includes selecting which denomination or denominations will be made available to players for play of the selected wagering game. For example the administrator may be prompted at block to Please enter the denom s you would like to make available for this theme. The operator may then select from a predefined menu the denomination s they want the game to execute at e.g. 1 cent 5 cents 10 cents 25 cents 1 dollar etc. or they may be allowed to enter them manually for example via a touch screen QWERTY keyboard. At block the method includes determining the payback percentage for each selected denomination. In this regard the administrator may be prompted to Per Denom Please enter the payback percentage you would like enabled. Alternatively one or more of the available denominations will have a predefined payback percentage associated therewith e.g. block may be omitted . The available options usually range between 86 92 . For example if an operator selects a 92 payback percentage the EGM on average will pay out 92 cents of every dollar that is wagered. Statistics show that the game will converge towards this targeted percentage over time as more wagers are placed.

The method may then include determining a desired value for a player performance variable. According to some of the disclosed concepts any recommended value output for the configuration parameter s is based on a respective desired value received for each of a plurality of player performance variables. The desired value for each player performance variable may be based at least in part on a statistical analysis of player wagering behavior. Physical interaction with a technician or operator however is not required for the desired value s to be determined. A desired value can be determined via one or more of the gaming devices on the gaming floor via a central gaming system networked with the gaming device s via an operator via a third party provider or any combination thereof.

It is desirable in some of the disclosed embodiments for the player performance variable to comprise an average wager per play of the wagering game or in a more specific instance the mathematical median bet per spin of a slot game. Block of for example includes entering a desired value for the average wager per spin for the desired location of the EGM. In this regard the administrator may be prompted to Please enter the average wager per spin where the game is located. Generally speaking the operator is asked for information about the type of wagering behavior that is occurring in a particular gaming establishment or in a specific section of the gaming establishment where the EGM is placed. Alternatively software in the EGM can decipher this value based on information collected by queries to other EGM s located within that vicinity. Optionally a central accounting system may track this information and make it available to the EGM.

Based on the desired value or values a recommended value is generated for one or more configuration parameters of the EGM. For some embodiments a recommended value is output for a variety of configuration parameters based on the desired value or values that are entered. Recommended values may be based on desired values for both player performance variables e.g. average wager per play and average number of payline played and game configuration variables denom and payback percentage . In this regard the method includes at block calculating the recommended parameters. The suggested configuration parameter s typically affect the mathematical configuration of the wagering game. By way of non limiting example the configuration parameters may include the wagering game line count available payline count maximum available bet and or minimum available bet. The suggested configuration parameters could also include a recommended hold percentage or payback percentage recommended reset values related to one or more progressive jackpots and or how much a player has to wager in order to cover all available paylines. Other configuration parameters may include what options the player is provided while playing the wagering game such as whether the game will be multi denominational and if so which denominations are made available penny nickel quarter dollar etc. . It may also be recommended that a progressive game feature be turned on off.

The suggested configuration parameters may also be directed to the wagering configuration of the button panel of the EGM. In particular every EGM includes display features for providing information and options to a player. Among these available display features may be a row of player selectable payline buttons each of which gives a player the option of quickly selecting and activating a predetermined number of paylines. For instance the row of player selectable payline buttons may include the following five options 

Various means may be used to determine the EGM configuration parameters. A software algorithm may be used to calculate from the desired value s the proper EGM configuration parameters. Alternatively a lookup table may be used such that the input is mapped to a corresponding predefined set of configuration parameters. Optionally a database of information may be generated for each customer remotely or on site and the suggested configuration parameters may be tailored to that customer based on the corresponding database of customer information. It would also be possible to have a smart software algorithm that would translate the input into the correct game configuration parameters. This evaluation of the heuristics and corresponding rules can be done on an EGM or an external device or a cloud service. In some embodiments the determination is game theme specific meaning that different games will have different configuration parameters based on the input s . Optionally a website could be provided which allows the operator to enter values for the player performance and or game configuration variables the EGM configuration parameters are determined by a back end third party provider and the EGM is configured remotely or a code directory is provided to the operator that is entered to set up the EGM.

Once the recommended configuration parameters are determined they can be output to the operator. Block for example includes displaying the recommended setup to the user. This may include providing via the primary display device of the EGM operator selectable options to confirm reject and or modify the recommended values. Block then requests confirmation to configure the EGM in accordance with the recommended configuration parameter parameters. Once confirmation is received the method will responsively configure the EGM in accordance with at least the recommended values for the configuration parameters. Some optional embodiments may include automatically configuring the EGM without first displaying the suggested configuration parameters and or requesting confirmation e.g. omitting blocks and or . Moreover the operator may input a rejection of one or more of the recommended values for the configuration parameters. In addition or as an alternative the operator may input a desired modification to a recommended value for the configuration parameter as indicated at block . Optionally the method can also inform the operator how any modifications to these suggested configuration values will affect the EGM e.g. a feedback loop . In general once the configuration parameters have been determined based on the input s the operator can be given the option to accept the recommended setup or reject it and may then be given the option to change or customize the recommended setup via an advanced selection. Once the configuration process is complete the method may return to block to allow the operator to configure another wagering game for example in a multigame situation. With the foregoing features the operator can quickly and easily modify the product mix on the floor i.e. the available wagering game options and how to configure each individual product.

As indicated above it may be desirable in some embodiments to configure a wagering game machine in a way that incentivizes a particular player demographic such as players at a particular location within a particular casino to play on that machine. For example one casino may have a room where the average bet on the EGM s in that room is approximately 50 60 cents we would then configure the gaming machines to ensure that the minimum and maximum wager options are configured to coincide with and exploit that average. Conversely in another location within that same casino or another casino altogether the average bet on the EGM s is approximately 1.05 those gaming machines would be configured to ensure that the minimum and maximum bet options coincide with that average. This will help to ensure that players will not only be drawn to those machines but when actually playing on those machines their average bet is at least on par with the average bet for that location.

Suggested values for EGM configuration parameters may also be based on the location of the gaming establishment itself. If the gaming establishment is located in the Midwest of the United States for example you may want to configure the EGM s with lower bet options since the Midwest typically has a relatively low average wager per play. In contrast if the gaming establishment is located in the Northeast or on the West Coast of the United States you may want to configure the EGM s with higher bet options since those regions are known to typically have a higher relative average wager per play. Similar rules may be applied on a more granular scale bank v. bank room v. room etc. a more localized scale casino vs. casino neighborhood vs. neighborhood city vs. city etc. or even on an international scale e.g. U.S. vs. Australia vs. France etc. 

According to some aspects of the disclosed concepts the ability to cover all lines is a minimum requirement for a wagering game. In particular the minimum average bet per play should be sufficient to cover all lines during a play of the corresponding wagering game. If the player cannot cover all lines in this manner a suggestion is made to change the configuration parameters to ensure compliance with this requirement. If the average wager per play on the casino floor for a particular game theme does not allow a player to cover all lines a different denomination may be suggested. If the wagering game is already operating at the lowest available denomination for that theme a different theme with a lower available denomination may be suggested. As another option to achieve this desired average bet it may be suggested that the wagering game be reconfigured with a lower line count to make sure that the player can cover all lines.

When determining suggested values for the EGM configuration parameters a monitoring scheme or system may be employed to check the surrounding gaming machines to determine if that section of the floor or the entire floor for that matter is misconfigured and providing flawed information. By way of example if player wagering behavior analysis is showing that players in a particular section are on average betting with the second to highest player selectable wager button or the fourth button in a five button arrangement the EGM is misconfigured. The available wager range for that particular section is configured too low which may have resulted from the average wager per play for that section of the floor being calculated to be too low. In this instance it should be suggested to raise the upper end of the range or possibly shift the whole range upwards.

Certain queries may be prioritized in determining the suggested configuration parameters. In this regard a hierarchy of questions can be generated ranging from most important to least important from simplest to most complex or a combination thereof. In accordance with at least some of the disclosed concepts a single principal or fundamental question can be employed to generate recommended values for a number of configuration parameters. For a simple hierarchy after one question is asked and answered and a set of values are recommend the operator may be given the option to answer the next question in the hierarchy to get a different set of recommend values that are more closely tailored to that operator s needs. In some embodiments the primary question is what is the average wager per play in this location. Second tier questions may include what is the denomination the operator wishes the EGM to operate at e.g. minimum denomination and or what is the desired payback percentage. Third tier questions may include how often is this location at capacity when is this location at capacity and or what is the average bet when this location is at capacity. Fourth tier questions may include what is the average bankroll for this location what is the average time on device for this location and or what is the average number of plays per monetary input. Operators may also be asked if they wish to fix all lines many slot games allow the player to choose how many lines they re playing however the operator may sometimes override that feature and insist that the player play all the lines. Specific questions may be generated that are designed to take advantage of the knowledge of the technicians who are installing the EGM on the floor while a set of questions may be generated that are designed to take advantage of what the casino is likely to know but not freely share. The questions may also vary based on game theme casino participation location etc. Moreover the questions do not have to be a fixed set of absolute questions the questions can be adaptive.

Also disclosed is an optional unified interface configuration module between the administration operation and maintenance AOM server s Mirador server s real time gaming RTG server s and the EGM. An abstracted cross platform EGM configuration application can be built and called up by different systems during configuration. Any system could then set the configuration parameters and transmit them to a standard application programming interface API . An advantage of this system is that updates improvements and or changes can more easily propagate from one system to another rather than having separate configuration implementations for each system. This approach can also offer more cross system consistency.

At the end of the configuration process a verification process may be initiated to verify that the gaming machine has been configured correctly. One method for doing this is to monitor the EGM to ensure that the CPU correctly responds to each of the configuration signals. This may include for example validating that the reconfiguration results in a positive change e.g. improved machine performance and increased yield . The validation process may require a threshold validation period such as a minimum amount of time or a minimum number of plays to offset periods of infrequent use. In many jurisdictions only certain configuration parameters might be acceptable. In many jurisdictions only certain configuration parameters might be acceptable. Consequently the gaming machine may be designed to verify that the configuration parameters requested are allowable in the jurisdiction where that machine is located. If they are not allowable the configuration may be rejected without changing the gaming machine configuration parameters. A verification ticket may be printed that will indicate that the configuration has not been accepted and the configuration parameters have not been changed.

The above teaching show that player behavior customer preferences heuristics and rules can be used to specify how various combinations of themes denominations pay tables line counts coins per line max wager amounts hold percentages episodes or other configuration parameters as well as other factors can be used in configuring one or more wagering game machines. A new configuration may result in dramatic changes such as new wagering games bonus rounds or episodes being configured for a wagering game machine. Alternatively a new configuration may result in relatively minor changes such as adjusting the hold percentage based on occupancy and average wager on a wagering game machine. The analysis may be based on absolute performance for example reconfiguring machines in the bottom 20th percentile or it may be based on performance trends e.g. machines in which revenue has been declining for a period of time.

It is also within the scope and spirit of the present invention to omit steps include additional steps and or modify the order presented above. It should be further noted that the method represents a single play of a wagering game. However it is expected that the method be applied in a systematic and repetitive manner.
