The present invention relates generally to collaborative computing systems and more particularly to interactive splitting of entries in social collaborative environments of one or more collaborative computing systems.

The Internet is a global network of computers joined together by gateways of computing networks that handle data transfer and transmission of messages from a protocol of a sending network to a protocol a receiving network. Information travels over the Internet through a variety of languages also referred to as network communication protocols. Instant messaging is a form of communication that travels over the Internet. Instant messaging also offers transmission of information between one or more individuals of collaborative computing systems.

The present invention will now be described in details with reference to the accompanying Figures. Referring to collaborative communication system for interactive splitting of a post of a social collaborative environment of collaborative communication system is shown. According to aspects of the present invention the social collaborative environment can be an enterprise social software program including for example IBM Notes wherein the social collaborative environment provides a social or personal business collaboration environment between users of collaborative communication system . For example the social collaborative environment supports collaborative interaction in forum posts blog entries or other types of collaborative correspondences between one or more users of collaborative communication system .

Consider for example an ongoing discussion between professionals of a work team wherein the ongoing discussion is conducted in a blog or a forum of a social collaborative environment. Certain social collaborative environments can provide a hierarchical relationship between posts and replies to the post of the ongoing discussion between the professionals. However social collaborative environments do not provide a mechanism that ll allow the professionals of the ongoing discussion to respond to specific paragraphs or portions of the post. For example suppose that a first colleague of the professional work team analyzes a spreadsheet and leaves the following feedback of the spreadsheet to share with other professional of the work team on a blog post of the social collaborative environment I was looking into this cost case and when I checked the development budget the same is not reflected in the second sheet. Regarding the requests I think it would be good to claim discount for quantity. I am also thinking that the domain registration can be made by us thus avoiding this cost. Another thing I would like to propose is to include the effort in hours and not just the money. Finally there is an error in a formula cell N28 that is increasing cost by 10 . How do you think we should make the correction A response to feedback by the colleague or second colleague of the professionals of the work team in the social collaborative environment could be The second sheet is only a reference. Forget it and focus on the total amount shown in the first sheet. What you say about requests I believe that they could discount us if we ask for more than ten units and with regard to registering the domain I don t believe that they will allow us to not pay for it because already comes included in the package. I agree with the effort hours. And about the formula you are forgetting to raise multiplication to the cost of the request less the discount. I ll do some tests by myself and if succeed I send you the corrected file. Assuming that the first colleague of the post replies to the response of the feedback by the second colleague the first colleague will need to clarify to which of any of the following posted issues or topics he is replying to for example With regard to . . . About such a thing . . . Your observation on. . . . Also consider that a third colleague gives an opinion on the post As the number of comments of the post grows it can be difficult to tell what specific portions of the posts in the social collaborative environment are responded to by any of the first second or third colleague of the professionals of the work team during the ongoing work discussion.

For example a lack of a hierarchical structure of the post of the ongoing work discussion can make it difficult to determine the relationships and responses of the post between any of the first second or third colleague of the professional work team. The present invention provides a system that allows any of the first second or third colleague of the professionals of the work team to respond to comments portions or segments of one or more entries of the post of the ongoing work discussion in an input field of the parts or segment of the post during collaborative post editing session between the any of the first second or third colleague of the social collaborative environment.
