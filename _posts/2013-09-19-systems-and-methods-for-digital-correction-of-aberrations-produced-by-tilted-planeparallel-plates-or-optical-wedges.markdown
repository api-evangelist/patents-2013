Plane parallel plates and optical wedges are commonly used in a wide variety of optical systems and serve an even wider variety of purposes. Examples of applications utilizing plane parallel plates include protective windows optical beam splitters optical beam combiners anti aliasing filters amplitude filters reflective prisms reticules etalons interferometers and others. When a plane parallel plate is used in collimated space of an incident light source the plane parallel plate does not introduce aberration into the light beam upon transmission. However when the light source is not collimated being either convergent or divergent aberrations are introduced into the optical beam upon transmission.

If a non collimated light source is normally incident upon a plane parallel plate then aberration produced by that plate will be rotationally symmetric. Correction of rotationally symmetric aberration produced by a plane parallel plate is often performed by the inclusion of other rotationally symmetric optical components such as a lens or series of lenses into an overall optical system. By appropriate design and placement of additional optical components additional aberrations introduced into the system act to balance out aberration produced by the plane parallel plate. An example of such a system is a traditional lens based microscope operating in the presence of a cover glass slide. To correct for aberration introduced by the presence of a cover slide a microscope objective often has a movable group of lenses included as part of the overall system design. For different axial positions of a movable group of lenses different amounts of aberrations are generated that can balance out the aberrations introduced by potentially variable movable and replaceable cover glass slides. Producing a system with multiple movable components requires potentially complex manufacturing processes as well as a consistent need for recalibration upon the change or movement of any component in the optical system. The rotationally symmetric components utilized within a microscope mainly correct for spherical aberrations and hence are mainly useful in systems where the objective is telecentric or nearly telecentric.

When a plane parallel plate is tilted such that a divergent or convergent beam of light is incident at a non normal angle to its surface the aberrations produced by that plate upon transmission or reflection are not rotationally symmetric. Consequently the use of rotationally symmetric lenses or mirrors along a common optical axis cannot be utilized to correct aberrations introduced by a tilted plane parallel plate. Similarly in the case of an optical wedge where the plate has non parallel sides either intentionally or due to fabrication errors rotational symmetry of the optics is destroyed even if the plate is not tilted. Accordingly rotationally symmetric lenses or mirrors along a common optical axis cannot be utilized to correct aberrations causes by optical wedges either.

The effect of a tilted plane parallel plate in the optical train may be visualized with reference to . Referring to there is illustrated a schematic diagram of a standard imaging process where three pencils of optical rays are depicted as traveling from an object plane through a uniform medium such as air to an image plane . The three pencils of rays depicted have angular offsets from an optical axis of 10 0 and 10 respectively. In the absence of any disturbances the rays converge to perfect focal point images on the same image plane . In contrast is illustrates an example wherein the three pencils of rays propagate from the object plane to the image plane through a tilted plane parallel plate having a refractive index different than the background medium. The tilted plane parallel plate introduces non rotationally symmetric aberration at each of the image locations on the image plane . Due to the aberration present the pencils of rays produced from an object plane are not able to focus at a single image plane and the blurred images from a point source have asymmetric blur. As there is no symmetry between lower and upper blur rotationally symmetric optics sharing a common optical axis with the object plane and image plane cannot be utilized to correct this blur either for the on axis pencil of rays or off axis pencils of rays.

Correcting for such non rotationally symmetric aberrations has traditionally required either the use of optical components that are also not rotationally symmetric or the tilting of added rotationally symmetric optical components in such a manner that all components in the system do not share a common optical axis. The manufacture and calibration of optical imaging systems containing multiple components that do not share a common optical axis has a much greater complexity compared to systems where all components are aligned along a common optical axis. In addition to increased manufacturing and calibration difficulty the most commercially available lenses are spherically symmetric components and consequently the prices for specialized non rotationally symmetric optical components are likely more expensive and are more difficult to obtain. The aberration compensation achieved through an introduction of one or more non rotationally symmetric optical components will be operational for a specifically located and oriented tilted plane parallel plate having a particular thickness and material refractive index. Should any of these location orientation or plate parameters change the previously introduced non rotationally symmetric optical elements no longer correct the aberrations produced by the plate and a difficult recalibration or expensive redesign of the optical system will likely be required.

Embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to optical imaging and more particularly to systems and processes for correcting image blur associated with aberration from tilted plane parallel plates and or optical wedges.

According to one embodiment an imaging method comprises generating an initial estimate of an optical point spread function of an optical imaging system that includes a plane parallel plate or optical wedge positioned in the optical train based on an optical prescription of the optical imaging system capturing a first image of a scene using the optical imaging system and applying a blind deconvolution process to the first image using the initial estimate of the optical point spread function to produce a refined estimate of the optical point spread function and produce a second image that is substantially without blur.

In one example the imaging method further comprises capturing a third image using the optical imaging system without inclusion of the plane parallel plate in the optical train. Producing the second image may include removing blur in the first image to produce the second image. In one example the imaging method further comprises comparing the second image to the third image to determine an extent of blur removal from the second image. The imaging method may further comprise storing the refined estimate of the optical point spread function on a computer readable storage medium. In another example the imaging method further comprises capturing a third image of the scene using the optical imaging system and processing the third image by applying a deconvolution process to the third image using the refined estimate of the optical point spread function.

According to another embodiment an optical imaging system comprises an imaging detector configured to produce a first image of a scene responsive to electromagnetic radiation received from the scene an optical sub system including a plane parallel plate or optical wedge and configured to focus the electromagnetic radiation from the scene onto the imaging detector and a processor coupled to the imaging detector. The processor may be configured to generate an initial estimate of an optical point spread function of the optical sub system based on an optical prescription of the optical sub system receive the first image from the imaging detector and apply a blind deconvolution process to the first image using the initial estimate to produce a refined estimate of the optical point spread function and remove blur from the first image to produce a second image that is substantially without blur.

In one example of the optical imaging system the plane parallel plate or optical wedge is selectively movable into and out of an imaging optical pathway of the optical sub system. In another example the imaging detector is further configured to produce a third image of the scene with the plane parallel plate or optical wedge moved out of the imaging optical pathway and wherein the processor is further configured to receive the third image and to compare the second image and the third image for determination of an extent of blur removal from the second image. In another example the plane parallel plate or optical wedge is tilted with respect to an optical axis of the optical sub system. The processor may be further configured to receive a third image from the imaging detector and apply a deconvolution process to the third image using the refined estimate of the optical point spread function.

According to these embodiments a digital imaging and processing system captures a digital image through an optical train containing at least one plane parallel plate and digitally corrects blur from non rotationally symmetric aberration induced by the plane parallel plate to achieve a state of virtual calibration. Once the system has been virtually calibrated additional images can be captured often in rapid succession and automatically deblurred using the results of the virtual calibration process.

Referring to there is illustrated a schematic diagram of one example of the optical imaging and processing system utilized for correcting non rotationally symmetric aberrations in accordance with an embodiment. The optical imaging and processing system is directed toward an object located at an object plane. A tilted plane parallel plate located within the optical train of the system and imaging optics are used to produce an image on an image detector array located at the image plane. According to one embodiment once an image is detected by a detector array and converted into digital signals representing that image those signals can be processed by a computer system and stored to a storage device . In some embodiments a processing system can be used to execute an optical design modeling program such as ZEMAX from Radiant Zemax LLC of Redmond Wash. CODE V from Synopsis Inc. of Mountain View Calif. OSLO from Lambda Research Corporation of Littleton Mass. or other similar optical design packages. In further embodiments the processing system can be used to execute an image processing software program capable of performing the techniques of two dimensional blind deconvolution and standard two dimensional deconvolution wherein examples of such image processing software programs include the Image Processing Toolbox for MATLAB from The MathWorks Inc. of Natick Mass. the DeconvolutionLab plug in for ImageJ from Ecole Polytechnique Federale De Lausanne of Lausanne Switzerland the Autoquant X3 program from Andor Technology PLC of Belfast United Kingdom or similar image processing programs.

A standard two dimensional optical deconvolution i.e. an operation inverse to a relevant optical convolution attempts to recover a sharp image from a blurry image created by an imager provided that the point spread function that caused the blur is known. Blind deconvolution operations are a family of algorithms that aim to recover a sharp image from a blurry image when the mathematical kernel describing the point spread function of the system causing the blur is unknown. In addition to producing a deblurred image the execution of a blind deconvolution algorithm such as the algorithms present in the image processing software packages mentioned above can also produce an approximate point spread function for the system that produced the image blur.

Embodiments of the system perform digital image capture optical system modeling and digital image processing operations for the correction of non rotationally symmetric aberration induced image blur. In some embodiments these image capture system modeling and image processing operations are performed by a digital imaging and processing system such as the optical imaging and computational system . The optical transfer function is defined in incoherent imaging as the two dimensional Fourier transform of the intensity point spread function. The point spread function is in turn a distribution of intensity in the image of a point object. According to one embodiment an initial kernel or estimate of the point spread function of the optical imaging system is obtained based on an idealized computer model of the system. In other embodiments the kernel is produced using the optical transfer function of optical imaging system also obtained based on an idealized computer model of the system as discussed further below. This initial kernel may be used as a starting input to a blind deconvolution process which applies an iterative process to refine the kernel and virtually digitally calibrate the system as discussed further below. Once a reasonable kernel has been established and stored the system can be considered calibrated and an ordinary deconvolution process may be used based on the obtained kernel to quickly produce decoded blur free images of a scene captured by the optical imaging system.

One such example of a process incorporating digital image capture optical system modeling and digital image processing is illustrated in the flow diagram of . According to this example the digital aberration correction process includes acts of capturing digital images from an optical system both with and without the presence of a tilted plane parallel plate modeling the point spread function of the same optical system with inclusion of a tilted plane parallel plate using optical design software performing image processing functionality for blind deconvolution on digital images containing non rotationally symmetric aberration induced blur and performing standard deconvolution operations on subsequent digital images using a point spread function associated with a virtually calibrated optical imaging system.

After completing a blind deconvolution of the initial optical system setup including the plane parallel plate a decision is made regarding the quality of the resulting digital image produced by the blind deconvolution process. If the image was determined not of acceptable quality then the optical system likely needs physical adjustment and the process returns to step . If the deblurred image was determined to be of sufficient quality then the virtual calibration process is deemed successful and the point spread function obtained from the blind deconvolution operation can be used to deblur other digital images captured with the same configuration of the optical imaging system.

Process begins at .

In act the computer system loads from storage location the blurred image taken in step and saved in step as well as the idealized point spread function calculated in step and saved in step . In act the blurred image and ideal point spread function are used as inputs to a blind deconvolution operation . In some embodiments the blind deconvolution operation utilized may be from a commercial software package such as MATLAB s Image Processing Toolbox the DeconvolutionLab plug in for ImageJ or the Autoquant X3 program. The outputs of the blind deconvolution operation include a deblurred version of the input image as well as a calculated point spread function that represents an optical system capable of producing that deblurred image.

Process begins at .

In act a point spread function associated with an acceptable virtual calibration of the optical imaging system in is loaded by the computer system from storage location . In act one or more new digital images are captured by image detector array and either stored within storage location or in the memory of computer system . The digital images captured in act contain non rotationally symmetric blur due to the presence of the plane parallel plate in the optical imaging train of the imaging system. In act the computer system performs standard deconvolution operation from an image processing software package such as one of the image processing software packages discussed above on images captured in step using the point spread function loaded in step . As a standard deconvolution operation is a very efficient operation by holding the utilized point spread function in memory of the computer system newly captured images can be deblurred in rapid succession. In act deblurred images are collected as output of the standard deconvolution operation and can be either stored in storage location or maintained in memory by the computer system for additional processing as desired.

The disclosed digital calibration procedure may be useful for implementation in a variety of optical imaging devices. Potential optical imaging devices for which the use of digital calibration via blind deconvolution may be utilized include areas such as digital microscopy as mentioned above as well as digital photography. In the area of digital photography compact system cameras CSC and digital single lens reflex DSLR cameras are often designed to have interchangeable lenses. Each brand of digital camera may be designed initially to utilize a specific combination of protective windows and stacks of filters such as mosaic RGB Bayer filters and anti aliasing filters in front of the camera sensor in the optical train. When very fast lenses are moved from one type or brand of camera to another the varying thicknesses and materials utilized in different filters may result in unexpected blur and degraded image resolution. This type of image degradation may be very pronounced when a fast lens designed for a film camera is used on a digital camera body. This effect may be very evident when a camera incorporates separate imaging sensors for separate color channels such as an RGB sensor system. In such a case there may be tilted dichroic filters for each color in the camera system. Aspects and embodiments of the systems and methods discussed herein may be used to compensate for such image degradation in digital camera systems making it easier to switch between different lens systems and filters.

Thus aspects and embodiments provide a digital calibration procedure to remove aberrations caused by tilted plane parallel plates or optical wedges in the optical train. According to certain embodiments the digital calibration procedure uses a blind deconvolution process in which the initial kernel estimate for the blind deconvolutor is based on optical prescription data for the optical system. This approach is faster simpler and more flexible than conventional methods for removing aberrations which involve hardware modifications and experimental calibrations using typical targets such as pinholes or slits to measure the optical point spread functions directly.
