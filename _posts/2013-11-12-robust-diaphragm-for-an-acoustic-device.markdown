title: Robust diaphragm for an acoustic device
abstract: A rigid, flat plate diaphragm for an acoustic device is illustrated. The internal supporting structure of the diaphragm provides a combination of torsional and translational stiffeners, which resemble a number of crossbars. These stiffeners brace and support the diaphragm motion, thus causing its response to not be adversely affected by fabrication stresses and causing it to be very similar in dynamic response to an ideal flat plate operating in a frequency range that extends well beyond the audible.

This invention was made with government support under award DAAD17 00 C 0149 awarded by the ARMY ARL. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to acoustic devices such as microphones and hearing aids and more particularly to an improved diaphragm for a microphone having a robust dynamic response in a frequency range extending well past the audible.

Fabrication of substantially flat compliant diaphragms is essential to the success of sensitive microphones. A significant obstacle to achieving this goal is the inevitable residual stresses induced during the process of manufacturing miniature microphone diaphragms. The thickness of miniature microphone diaphragms is typically on the order of microns. Stresses in such thin films can result in warpage or buckling or can lead to breakage. Much effort has been put into controlling the flatness and dynamic performance of thin film diaphragms.

One common method to prevent the aforementioned warpage is to clamp all four edges or all four corners of a thin diaphragm and utilize tensile stress to control the flatness. The tension however increases the stiffness of the diaphragm and consequently decreases the sensitivity of the microphone. The inability to accurately control the tensile stress during fabrication also leads to unpredictable dynamic characteristics for the microphone.

To achieve an acceptable sensitivity a microphone diaphragm needs to be very compliant. The cantilever structure described in this invention is an alternative to conventional four edge or four corner clamped devices. The new cantilever design seeks to achieve a sensitive microphone since cantilever diaphragms are much more compliant than tensioned diaphragms.

One of the objects of the present invention is to provide a robust microphone diaphragm design that maintains good dimensional control under the influences of residual stresses either compressive or tensile while having its dynamic response dominated only by a single mode of vibration. The response of the diaphragm is predicted to be extremely close to that of an ideal rigid plate over a frequency range extending well beyond the audible range.

The internal supporting structure of this diaphragm provides a combination of torsional and translational stiffeners that resemble a number of crossbars. These stiffeners brace and support the diaphragm motion thus causing it to be very similar in dynamic response to an ideal flat plate operating in a frequency range extending well beyond the audible. The diaphragm is essentially constrained to pivot about an edge upon which it is supported. The supported end has an overlapping T section whose length and cross sectional dimensions can be adjusted to tune the resonant frequency.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5 633 552 issued to Lee et al a method is disclosed for fabricating a micro machined pressure transducer having a multilayer silicon nitride thin film cantilever diaphragm. The technique relies on the symmetry of the stress gradient in the two outer layers and a larger tensile stress 250 MPa in the second layer to maintain diaphragm flatness.

The diaphragm of the present invention relies on the use of stiffeners to maintain flatness rather than as the prior art teaches attempting to balance existing stresses in the various layers of the diaphragm. The patent shows static deflections due to stress of more than 15 microns. Predictable maximum deflection of the diaphragm of the current invention will be approximately 0.5 microns. This is an improvement over the related art by a factor of 30.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5 870 482 issued to Loeppert et al a cantilever center support diaphragm is illustrated. This patent uses a corrugated structure and a sandwich of two quilted films separated by a thin 2 3 micron sacrificial layer in order to match the diaphragm compliance to the desired pressure range. It is also desired to counter any curling tendency of the diaphragm. In the current invention the design provides better control over the flatness.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5 146 435 issued to Bernstein a structure consisting of a single crystal silicon diaphragm supported on its corners by patterned silicon springs is shown. By supporting the diaphragm only at the corners as suggested by Bernstein it is possible to increase the diaphragm compliance and subsequently the sensitivity to sound.

While this approach permits a design that is more compliant than the usual approach where the diaphragm is supported entirely around its perimeter it does not ensure that the stresses in the structure will not result in warpage if the stress is tensile and it is quite possible that compressive stresses will result in buckling.

By incorporating stiffeners in the present inventive diaphragm improved flatness is achieved. The current inventive diaphragm is supported on specially designed torsional springs that have very high stiffness in the transverse direction but which have well controlled stiffness in torsion.

In accordance with the present invention there is provided an improved diaphragm for a microphone acoustic sensor or hearing aid that is not adversely affected by fabrication stresses. It is robust in the sense that it is not affected by fabrication stresses. The diaphragm comprises a rigid flat plate of polysilicon or similar material. The internal supporting structure provides a combination of torsional and translational stiffeners that resemble a number of crossbars. These stiffeners brace and support the diaphragm motion thus causing it to be very similar in dynamic response to an ideal flat plate operating in a frequency range that extends well beyond the audible. The diaphragm is essentially constrained to pivot about an edge upon which it is supported. The supported end has an overlapping T section whose length and cross sectional dimensions can be adjusted to tune the resonant frequency.

It is an object of this invention to provide an improved diaphragm for a microphone hearing aid or acoustic device.

It is another object of the invention to provide a diaphragm for a microphone hearing aid or acoustic sensor that is not affected by fabrication stresses.

Generally speaking the invention features an internally stiffened rigid flat plate diaphragm for an acoustic device. The internal supporting structure of the diaphragm provides a combination of torsional and translational stiffeners which resemble a number of crossbars. These stiffeners brace and support the diaphragm motion thus causing it to be very similar in dynamic response to an ideal flat plate operating in a frequency range that extends well beyond the audible.

Now referring to a schematic view of a stiffened diaphragm for use in an acoustic device in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. The diaphragm is shaped like a flat rectangular box having internal stiffeners and respectively forming crossbar bracing members. The crossbar bracing members cause the motion of the diaphragm to approach that of an ideal flat plate. The crossbar members provide the diaphragm with torsional and translational stability. Diaphragm is supported and pivots about a fixed end T section as shown in .

The diaphragm can be used in a microphone and can be fabricated from polycrystalline silicon or similar material in a microfabrication process. In the microfabrication process the diaphragm is highly robust and tolerant of fabrication defects. The diaphragm maintains exceptional flatness under the influence of either compressive or tensile stresses that may occur during manufacture. The dynamic response of the diaphragm conforms to an ideal flat plate over a frequency range extending well beyond the audible range. The dynamic characteristics of the diaphragm can be readily tuned without adversely influencing the flatness or ruggedness thereof.

The T section can be adjusted in length and cross section for tuning the resonant frequency. The overall dimensions of the diaphragm are 1 mm by 1 mm. The stiffening crossbars and respectively can be 4 microns thick and 40 microns tall.

A first mode of vibration is predictably at 24 kHz and a second mode is at 84 kHz. The second mode is well above the audible frequency and therefore will not influence the response. Utilization of stiffeners and pushes the unwanted modes of diaphragm into the ultrasonic frequency range so that the response is very similar to an ideal flat plate structure.

The diaphragm has high bending rigidity as shown in . The diaphragm is not prone to buckling when subjected to 40 Mpa of isotropic compressive stress. The identical result with opposite sign is obtained with a tensile stress loading.

Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this invention.

Having thus described the invention what is desired to be protected by Letters Patent is presented in the subsequently appended claims.
