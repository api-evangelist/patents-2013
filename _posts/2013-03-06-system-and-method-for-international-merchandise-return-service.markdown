Beginning at a start state process continues at state where a consumer in a first country purchases merchandise from a U.S. merchant via the Internet world wide web or other online means although the purchase can be performed via the telephone mail or other means. In certain embodiments the merchant registers with a merchandise handling agent or carrier by providing information so that information such as a merchant name merchant account merchant type and service preferences can be obtained. In other embodiments the merchant can register with an organization such as the United States Postal Service USPS . Information such as a customer registration identification CRID a mailer identification MID and a permit number can be generated for association with the merchant. In certain embodiments the merchant can be assigned a different MID for each country from which returns are to be accepted. In certain embodiments each mailing facility or depot associated with a particular merchant can be assigned a different CRID. In other embodiments and or for other countries other information may be obtained and or generated. For example the merchant or seller of the merchandise may not need a permit number a CRID a MID and or other particular identifiers.

Proceeding to a state the purchased merchandise is delivered to the consumer in the first country but the consumer desires to return at least some of the received merchandise. In certain embodiments an agent or carrier such as the USPS transports the merchandise from the merchant such as from a merchant depot or shipping location to a mailing service of the first country for delivery to the location of the consumer.

Advancing to state the consumer initiates a return of the merchandise to the merchant such as by accessing a returns portion of a website for the merchant. Alternatively the consumer calls a call center for the merchant where a call center agent fields the call and opens a returns web application or program. In other embodiments other ways to initiate a return are envisioned. In certain embodiments a return merchandise authorization RMA can be assigned for the return by the merchant website or the call center agent.

In certain embodiments the carrier in the second country is used for both the outbound and inbound shipments. In this situation the carrier can offer merchants who ship outbound using certain mail service types such as priority mail international or express mail international for example a low flat rate for international returns. In other embodiments other service levels can be utilized. The flat rate international return label can be generated on demand when a customer requests to return an item by accessing the original outbound order to create the new flat rate return therefore ensuring an outbound inbound linkage. This service offering may incentivize merchants to grow their outbound volume by decreasing the barriers of international shipping. In certain embodiments the flat rate return is only paid for if a return is initiated by a customer requesting from the merchant to return an item. This service will appeal to certain merchants based on the value of the merchandise the volume of transactions and their customer base.

Moving to state in either situation website or call center described at state the returns transaction is redirected to the agent s returns website where a returns application is performed. In certain embodiments the agent s returns application is performed as a cloud application. In other embodiments the website for the merchant can instead utilize an application programming interface API to integrate the returns application with the merchant website.

Continuing at a state process receives shipment details for generating a return label through the website application. For example the country from which the consumer is returning the merchandise can be identified via an example interface display screen such as shown in where a list of countries is displayed for selection. In other embodiments the country can be obtained in other ways Referring to a further example interface display screen can be used to identify merchant information such as the merchant name. The merchant name can be used to access merchant information from the data storage or the cloud storage in cloud for example. The merchant information can include information such as the address of the merchant depot closest to the consumer for example if the merchant has more than one depot for returns. In embodiments where the merchandise is purchased from a party other than a merchant an address for receiving the return is accessed. If the website application is accessed by a call center agent the merchant information may be prepopulated with the corresponding merchant information.

The display screen can additionally display entry fields in a name and address section for receiving the name and address of the consumer returning the merchandise. The display screen can additionally display entry fields in a package and shipping information section for receiving a description of the merchandise being returned a selection of a service type and a selection of a label type . In certain embodiments the service type can be selected from a list of service types including First Class Package Return Service Ground Return Service Parcel Return Service and Priority Mail Return Service. In other embodiments the selections can include First Class Mail International FCMI parcels Priority Mail International PMI parcels and or Express Mail International EMI parcels. In certain embodiments the label type can be selected from a list of labels types including but limited to 4 4 4 6 5 8 A4 and A5 label sizes. In other embodiments any size that is agreed to by the carriers of both countries can be used. After the process receives the entered information an example interface display screen such as shown in displays the received information for confirmation. If the information is correct a button can be selected or clicked to proceed with creating the return label.

Proceeding to state process optionally initiates a real time web service call to the carrier service of the first country from which the merchandise is being returned to obtain a unique identifier for the return label. In other embodiments other electronic ways to obtain information needed for the return label such as to track the returns package are utilized. In certain embodiments the unique identifier can be utilized as a unique tracking number. In certain embodiments the carrier service of the first country provides an entire machine readable identifier such as a barcode. In other embodiments the carrier service of the first country provides a pre established range of identifier characters to be used by the return application in generating the machine readable identifier. Furthermore in certain embodiments address standardization and or verification are performed on the consumer s address. However in other embodiments address standardization and or verification of the consumer s address is not required.

In certain embodiments the shipping charge due facility is the closest unit to the merchant or merchant returns depot. In certain embodiments the shipping charge due amount can be added to the return label. In other embodiments other ways of determining the shipping charge due are envisioned.

Advancing to state in some embodiments the merchant is not charged if the merchant utilized the same U.S. carrier for both origination and return shipments and or if the merchant has preferred status with the carrier. In other embodiments the merchant has prepaid a returns coverage fee at the time the outbound shipping was purchased and no charge is needed when the return is processed.

Proceeding to state the carrier service of the first country that delivered the package to the customs service is credited for the shipment of the package. Continuing to state the package is then delivered to the merchant merchant depot or seller of the merchandise where it is received by the merchant at state and the return is complete. Process ends at state .

In other embodiments the first country where the consumer is located can be the United States and the country where the merchant is located is another country such as Canada. In such a scenario a carrier or agent such as the USPS ships the returns package from the U.S. consumer to the Canada Border Services Agency which then provides the package to a carrier or agent such as Canada Post for delivery to the Canadian merchant. The process can be utilized with other countries as well.

Various illustrative logics logical blocks modules circuits and algorithm steps described in connection with the implementations disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware computer software or combinations of both. The interchangeability of hardware and software has been described generally in terms of functionality and illustrated in the various illustrative components blocks modules circuits and steps described above. Whether such functionality is implemented in hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.

In one or more aspects the functions described may be implemented in hardware digital electronic circuitry computer software firmware including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents thereof or in any combination thereof. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification also can be implemented as one or more computer programs e.g. one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer storage media for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus.

If implemented in software the functions may be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer readable storage medium. The steps of a method or algorithm disclosed herein may be implemented in a processor executable software module which may reside on a computer readable storage medium. Computer readable storage media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that can be enabled to transfer a computer program from one place to another. A storage media may be any available media that may be accessed by a computer. By way of example and not limitation such computer readable media may include RAM ROM EEPROM CD ROM or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium that may be used to store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that may be accessed by a computer. Also any connection can be properly termed a computer readable medium. Disk and disc as used herein includes compact disc CD laser disc optical disc digital versatile disc DVD floppy disk and Blu ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above can also be included within the scope of computer readable storage media. Additionally the operations of a method or algorithm may reside as one or any combination or set of codes and instructions on a machine readable storage medium and computer readable storage medium which may be incorporated into a computer program product.

Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations also can be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single implementation also can be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.

Instructions refer to computer implemented steps for processing information in the system. Instructions can be implemented in software firmware or hardware and include any type of programmed step undertaken by components of the system.

As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art each of the modules of the invention may comprise various sub routines procedures definitional statements and macros. Each of the modules are typically separately compiled and linked into a single executable program. Therefore the description of each of the modules is used for convenience to describe the functionality of the system. Thus the processes that are undergone by each of the modules may be arbitrarily redistributed to one of the other modules combined together in a single module or made available in a shareable dynamic link library. Further each of the modules could be implemented in hardware.

The foregoing description details certain embodiments. It will be appreciated however that no matter how detailed the foregoing appears in text the development may be practiced in many ways. It should be noted that the use of particular terminology when describing certain features or aspects of the development should not be taken to imply that the terminology is being re defined herein to be restricted to including any specific characteristics of the features or aspects of the development with which that terminology is associated.

While the above detailed description has shown described and pointed out novel features of the development as applied to various embodiments it will be understood that various omissions substitutions and changes in the form and details of the device or process illustrated may be made by those skilled in the technology without departing from the intent of the development. The scope of the development is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
