The present invention relates to a technique for controlling progress by a plurality of users in a game in accordance with various operations by the users.

Recently so called social networking games are executed on game applications created on the basis of operating environments such as application programming interfaces API operated on a web browser in a social networking service SNS provided by a specific service provider. Social network games may be called a type of online game played between a plurality of unspecified users while communicating with each other. A user who is able to connect to the Internet and has a communication terminal including a web browser is able to enjoy social networking games regardless of the time or location.

A digital card game called Dragon Collection trademark described in a Japanese magazine Vol. 5 Eastpress Co. Ltd. Nov. 1 2011 p. 7 8 is an example of a social networking game.

In social networking games power points for a user for example may be set and points e.g. power points may be consumed in the progress of the game so that when no more points can be consumed the user is not able to progress any further in the game. In order to increase restore a certain amount of points in a certain time period for example a mechanism allows the user to once again proceed in the game after an amount of time has elapsed.

Meanwhile a user may be registered in a plurality of social networking games. When a user is not able to proceed in a game after playing one of the games in which the user is registered the user conventionally selects another game that can be played among the registered games and plays the selected game. In this case for example since the user does not know any information about whether enough points to be able to proceed satisfactorily in the game have been restored until the user accesses that game the user is required to access the registered game at random in order to check whether he is able to satisfactorily proceed in the game which is tedious.

In consideration of the above problem an object of the present invention is to provide a game control device a game control method a program and a game system that allow a user while playing or intending to play a certain game to know information about himself or herself in relation to another game.

In the game control device of the third aspect of the present invention the user is notified about user information for the second game associated with that user when the execution state of the user for the first game satisfies the first condition. Consequently the user executing the first game is able to learn about information user information about himself or herself with regard to the second game associated with himself or herself and thus is able to adequately judge whether to progress or execute the second game.

The method of notifying the user about the user information may include a method of displaying the user information in a game image or a method of outputting the user information by sound and the like.

a first determining means for determining whether a state of the first game satisfies a first condition when a user is executing the first game 

an information obtaining means for obtaining user information of the second game associated with the user when the first condition is determined to be satisfied by the first determining means and

a notifying means for notifying the user about the user information for the second game obtained by the information obtaining means.

The above game control device may further comprise a state obtaining means for obtaining a state of the first game wherein 

the first determining means determines whether the first condition is satisfied on the basis of the state of the first game obtained by the state obtaining means and

the information obtaining means refers to a storage device that stores information related to an association of a game and the user specifies the second game as a game associated with the user and obtains user information of the user for the second game.

In the game control device of the fourth aspect of the present invention the user is notified about user information about the second game associated with the user when the state of the first game satisfies the first condition. Consequently the user intending to execute the first game is able to learn about information user information about himself or herself with regard to the second game associated with himself or herself when for example a state in which the first game cannot be executed exists and thus is able to adequately judge whether to progress or execute the second game.

The method of notifying the user about the user information may include a method of displaying the user information in a game image or a method of outputting the user information by sound and the like.

The first game in the above game control device has user information that includes a parameter that fluctuates in accordance with the game progression and the first game may be a game in which the game progression is hampered when a value of the parameter is in a certain range and the first condition may be that the value of the parameter of the user for the first game be in the certain range. At this time the user cannot progress in the first game when the first condition is determined to have been satisfied. Under this state the user information for a second game that is different from the first game becomes particularly convenient for the user so that the user can start the second game according to the user information of the second game.

The first condition in the above game control device is a state in which the first game cannot be executed. A state in which the first game cannot be executed is a state in which the execution of the first game cannot be started due to for example maintenance and the like by the game operator of the first game. Under this state the user information for the second game that is different from the first game becomes particularly convenient for the user so that the user can start the second game according to the user information of the second game.

The above game control device may further comprise a second determining means for determining whether the user information of the user for the second game obtained by the information obtaining means satisfies a second condition wherein the notifying means may notify the user about the user information of the user of the second game when the second determining means determines that the second condition is satisfied.

By notifying the user about the user information when the second condition is satisfied instead of notifying the user about the user information of the second game randomly the user can be notified about the user information of a suitable second game. For example when information e.g. information such as the power points for progressing the game about whether the second game can be progressed by the user is included as the user information of the second game the user information of the second game that can be progressed can be notified on the basis of the second condition and the user can be made aware that the second game can be progressed at the point in time that the first game cannot be progressed.

The information obtaining means in the above game control device may obtain the user information of the second game from a game control device that executes the second game. Traffic is advantageously reduced by conducting the exchange of the user information directly between the game control devices since the exchange of the information is conducted without passing through another device.

The information obtaining means in the above game control device may obtain the user information of the second game from an information management device having user information for a plurality of games. Since the user information of a plurality of games is controlled in the information management device in an integrated manner in this configuration the game control devices can reliably obtain the user information from the information management device even if for example communication between the game control devices is hampered.

The notifying means in the above game control device may cause the user information of the second game to be displayed in a game image of the first game. Although the user information notification method to the user may be a method of outputting the user information by sound by employing a method of displaying the user information in a game image the user is able to recognize the game images even when in an environment e.g. in a public transportation facility where for example the output of sound is restricted. Furthermore the user may fail to hear the user information when outputting the user information by sound and thus unreliability of transmitting the information can be reduced by displaying the user information.

The notifying means in the above game control device may cause information indicating the fact that the first condition has been satisfied to be displayed in the game image in addition to displaying the user information in the game image. Any method can be used as a display method such as a display with text or a display with a mark or other pattern. Consequently it is convenient for the user since the required information is displayed with a single game image. Moreover the time when an executed game is continued but cannot be executed further is a time that another game can be played another game can be executed . However the importance of the display of the information of the other game increases when considering which game to play next when notified that the game that is being executed cannot be continued.

The notifying means in the above game control device may cause an operating target for starting execution of the second game to be additionally displayed in the game image of the first game. As a result user information of the second game can be quickly recognized when accessing the first game while executing the first game or when the first game cannot be progressed.

A menu m Execute again is displayed in the web page P in order to continue the searching. A value of an achievement ratio increases by a fixed or a random increase amount when the menu m or the menu m is selected and the searching area is completed when the achievement ratio reaches 100 and the user is able to progress to the next area. Only a certain amount 8 in the example in of the power points of the user is consumed and only a certain amount 8 in the example in of the experience value of the user increases when the menu m or the menu m is selected. The area to be searched may be provided as a plurality of areas. When the menu m or the menu m is selected the quest processing may be configured to allow the user to obtain various prepared items or cards in the game with a fixed or a random probability. The obtained cards and items are displayed for example in a display area of the web page.

The power points are consumed reduced by only a certain amount when executing the quest and a point display area is provided for displaying the power points held by the user after the reduction. For example when switching from the web page P to P it can be seen that the power points are reduced from 100 to 92 . The selection operation of the menu m in the web page P is continued until the quest cannot be executed any further since as represented in a web page Pfor example the power needed for one quest e.g. 8 will be consumed when the power points become depleted e.g. 4 . As described above since the power points are restored increased by a fixed amount for every fixed period of time in the state of the web page P the user is required to wait a certain amount of time to be able to adequately execute the quest of the game A again.

In the game system of the present embodiment the web page is updated as represented by P in or B when the menu m in the web page Pis selected. The web page P is provided with a text display area a point display area and a guiding area . A text is included in the text display area that notifies the user the fact that the quest of the game A cannot be executed for a while since the power points are insufficient. The current power points of the user are displayed in the point display area in the same way as in the point display area in . Since the quest is not executed at this time the display contents of the point display area are the same as those of the point display area of the web page P

Information about the power points of the same user with respect to a game B and a banner BN for starting the execution of the game B are displayed in the guiding area as an example of user information about the game B that is another game. The banner is an example of an operating target of the present invention.

The web page P in represents an example when the power points of the user for the game B are completely restored that is when the power points of the user equal the maximum value of the power points of the user at the current point in time . The web page P in displays a specific value of the power points of the user for the game B when the power points are in the middle of being restored the example in indicates that the power points have been restored to 68 while the maximum value is 85 .

Although A and B represent examples in which the power points of the user user information and the banner BN for starting the game B in relation to the game B are displayed at a timing in which the user has started executing the game A and the game progress is hampered the present invention is not limited to this example. For example the power points of the user in relation to the game B may be displayed when the power points of the user become equal to or less than a certain value.

The following is an explanation of functions of the game control device for realizing the abovementioned game of the present embodiment.

In the present embodiment the game control device of the present invention is configured for example by the game server and the database server . Hereinbelow an example of the game server and the database server that execute the game A with respect to the functions realized by the game control device of the present embodiment will be described with reference to as an example applicable to the abovementioned game of the embodiment. The other game servers and etc. and database servers and etc. are the same.

The registration means includes functions to recognize a user registration request for example on the basis of information related to a suitable operation input to the communication terminal on a web page provided to the communication terminal and to conduct registration processing. The registration processing is conducted when the user conducts a user registration in the game of the present embodiment.

The functions of the registration means are realized for example as described below. The CPU of the game server receives a registration request message from the communication terminal through the communication interface unit . The registration request message may be automatically created by a certain operation e.g. a selection of a certain menu a user ID designated by the user or a text input such as a password in the communication terminal on a web page provided by the game server so that a web page is configured. Information e.g. an email address or unique identification information of the terminal such as a unique identifier UID for specifying the communication terminal that is the transmission source may be included in the registration request message. Alternatively when the user is already using another game from the same service provider the registration request message may include the user ID of the user.

The CPU receives the registration request message and when a user ID is not included in the registration request message the CPU issues a new user ID and processes the new user ID and then transmits a message to the communication terminal indicating the fact that the registration processing is completed. The CPU receives the registration request message and when a user ID is included in the registration request message and after processing the user ID the CPU transmits the registration completion message to the communication terminal indicating that the registration processing is completed. The registration processing includes the CPU creating user data corresponding to the user ID and storing the user data in the user database . When the registration is completed the user is able to execute the game of the present embodiment. After completing the registration upon receiving a HTTP request for logging in from the communication terminal of each user the CPU and obtains the unique identification information or the user ID and the password from the HTTP request and verifies the unique identification information or the user ID and the password with for example registered data in the user database to conduct the authentication processing.

The associating means has a function for associating different users. Namely the associating means records a user ID and another user ID in association with each other when for example an application occurs on the basis of those user IDs. Specifically the associating means records the other user ID that is the other user as friend when the application occurs on the basis of the user ID.

The functions of the associating means are realized for example as described below. The CPU of the game server receives an application message friend application that specifies a user ID or the corresponding user name that the user desires be friends with from the communication terminal of the user corresponding to the user ID through the communication interface unit . The transmission of the application message may be previously set as a function of the web page provided to the communication terminal of the user.

Upon receiving the application message the CPU transmits HTML data for displaying a web page to request a reply for acknowledging the application on the basis of the other user ID to the communication terminal corresponding to the user ID when there is an access based on the user ID included in the application message. The CPU registers both users as friends if the acknowledgment of the application is returned. Specifically the CPU writes data partner user IDs in the Friend user IDs location of the user data of the two corresponding user IDs in the user database . The CPU may register both users as friends upon the users conducting a certain operation during the execution of the game if the acknowledgment of the users prior to the friend application is not necessary.

The execution of the game A in the present embodiment is achieved by transmitting HTML data for successively updating web pages displayed on the communication terminal in response to operations by the user on the communication terminal . The CPU of the game server receives a HTTP request from the communication terminal through the communication interface unit executes the processing requested by the HTTP request and sends a HTTP response that includes HTML data that is the execution result back to the communication terminal .

The execution contents of the processing requested by the HTTP request may differ according to the functions provided in the game but for example are as follows.

For example when executing a request described in relation to the CPU of the game server conducts processing to update the user achievement ratio the power points and the experience value to be processed upon receiving a HTTP request that includes certain selection operation contents e.g. selection operation results of the menus m or m selected by the user. The CPU may transfer the data of the achievement ratio the power points and the experience value of the user to the RAM from the time of the quest execution start the time the menu m is selected may conduct the update processing of the data in the RAM during the quest and may overwrite the data in the database server with the data after the updating in the RAM .

For example when executing a battle with another user using cards the CPU of the game server may compare the values of parameters e.g. values for attack strength and defense strength and the like of the cards used in the battle of the users subject to the battle and may decide the outcome of the battle on the basis of the results of the comparison.

A first determining means has a function for determining whether an execution state of the game A first game by the user satisfies a first condition. In the present embodiment the first condition for example may satisfy when the power points in the game A being executed by the user equals or falls below a certain value and the user cannot execute the quest any further.

In order to realize the functions of the first determining means the CPU of the game server conducts processing to update the power points as described above upon receiving a HTTP request that includes certain selection operation contents e.g. selection operation results of the menus m or m selected by the user. The processing includes comparing the power points of the user and the power points required to execute the quest to determine that the first condition is satisfied when the power points of the user are less the power points cannot be reduced since they will become a negative value . For example when the user s power points are 6 and when 8 power points are required to execute the quest once the power points cannot be reduced and thus the first condition is satisfied.

Although not represented in the game control device of the present embodiment may include a state obtaining means for obtaining an execution state of the user in the game A first game . Although the CPU of the game server reads and obtains the power points of the user from for example the user data of the user to be processed for comparing the power points of the user with the power points required for executing the quest the processing to obtain the power points by the CPU is one example of implementation of the state obtaining means functions.

An information obtaining means includes a function to obtain user information of a user in any of games B C and etc. second game that differs from the game A first game from another game server device executing any of the games B C and etc. second game when the first condition is determined by the first determining means to be satisfied.

The user information may be power points in the example of the game of the present embodiment. The game subject to the obtaining of the user information may be decided beforehand. For example when the game subject to the first condition determination is the game A the game from which the user information is obtained second game may be decided beforehand as the game B.

The functions of the information obtaining means can be realized as described hereinbelow. When for example the game B is decided beforehand as the game from which the user information is obtained the CPU of the game server controls the API server of the game server to send a request for obtaining power points example of user information of the game B of the user subject to the processing to the API server of the game server that is the server executing the game B. In response to the request from the API server of the game server the API server of the game server returns to the API server of the game server a response that includes the power point value in the game B of the user subject to the processing and that is stored in the user database of the database server . After this processing is completed the CPU of the game server obtains the power points of the game B of the user subject to the processing.

The information obtaining means may refer to a storage device that stores information related to the associations between different games to specify the game B C and etc. second game as the game associated with the game A first game and may obtain the user information of the user of the second game. That is the game from which the user information is obtained by the information obtaining means may be a game associated with the game A first game . In this case a table for describing the relationships between a game and games associated with that game is provided in the game database as represented in the example in so that the CPU can decide the game from which to obtain the user information by accessing the table. For example in the example in since the game B and the game E are included in the games associated with the game A the CPU of the game server selects a game from which the user information is to be obtained with the same probability among the game B and the game E or selects any of the games with a probability in accordance with a level of association with the game A. In this way by selecting a game associated with the game A first game as the game from which the user information is to be obtained the user can be effectively guided from the game A to a game selected since for example a game with the same acceptability as the game A or a game with a high level of similarity in the game structure as the game A is selected.

A storage device for storing the table represented in that is the information concerning the associations between different games may be the abovementioned game database or may be provided in a storage or an external storage device connectable through a network.

In another aspect the information obtaining means may refer to a storage device that stores information concerning the associations between games and a user to specify the game B C and etc. second game as the game associated with the user and may obtain the user information of the user of the second game. That is the game from which the user information is obtained by the information obtaining means may be a game associated with the user subject to the processing. In this case a table for describing the relationships between a user and games associated with that user is provided in the game database as represented in the example in so that the CPU can decide the game from which to obtain the user information by accessing the table. For example in the example in since the games A B and F are included in the games associated with a user KNM user ID 000001 the CPU of the game server selects a game from which the user information is to be obtained with the same probability among the game B and the game F or selects any of the games with a probability in accordance with a level of association with the user. The CPU of the game server may obtain from another server through the API server for example progress levels of games or frequencies of log ins and the like of a user in order to decide games associated with the user and a degree of association between the games and the user. In this way by selecting a game associated with the user subject to the processing as a game from which the user information is obtained the user can be effectively guided from the game A to a selected game since for example a game that the user has frequently executed or a game with a high level of progression by the user is selected.

A storage device for storing the table represented in that is the information concerning the associations between the user and the games may be the abovementioned game database or may be provided in a storage or an external storage device connectable through a network.

A notifying means includes a function for notifying the user about user information of any of the games B C and etc. second game obtained by the information obtaining means .

When the information obtaining means obtains the power points user information of the game B for example in order to realize the functions of the notifying means the CPU of the game server obtains the power points of the game B of the user subject to the processing from the game server and transmits for example HTML data including the power points of the game B to the communication terminal of the user in response to a HTTP request that includes certain selection operation contents e.g. result of selection operation of the menu m or m by the user. Consequently a web page that includes the power points of the game B is displayed on the communication terminal of the user. In addition to the power points of the game B a banner for starting the execution of the game B is preferably included in the HTML data transmitted to the communication terminal of the user.

Next an example of a main processing flow conducted by the game system according to the present embodiment will be explained with reference to the sequence chart in . The sequence chart in is an example in which the user is executing the game A and the user information is to be obtained from the game B.

For example a case is assumed in which a specific user U repeatedly executes a quest. The CPU of the communication terminal transmits a HTTP request including a selection operation result of the menu m to the game server due to the selection operation of the menu m see by the user U step S . The CPU of the game server receives the HTTP request of step S and performs processing to update the achievement ratio the power points and the experience value of the user U subject to the processing. Here it is determined that the first condition is satisfied in the processing when the power points cannot be reduced step S YES . If the power points can be reduced step S NO the routine advances to step S to create HTML data for displaying the power points and the like after updating step S .

When the first condition is determined to have been satisfied in step S the CPU of the game server controls the API server of the game server to create a request for obtaining power points example of user information of the game B of the user U subject to the processing from the API server of the game server that is the server executing the game B step S . As a result the above request is sent from the API server of the game server to the API server of the game server step S . The user ID of the user U subject to the processing is included in the request. The CPU of the game server that receives the request extracts the power points as user information from the user data using the user ID subject to the request as a key step S . The API server of the game server returns to the API server of the game server a response that includes the value of the power points user information in the game B of the user U subject to the processing step S .

The CPU of the game server obtains the power points of the game B of the user U subject to the processing from the game server creates HTML data including the power points of the game B in response to a HTTP request of the step S step S and transmits the HTML data to the communication terminal of the user U step S . Consequently a web page of the game A is updated on the communication terminal of the user U step S . The power points of the game B are included in the updated web page of the game A. When the response of step S is received a banner for starting the execution of the game B is preferably included in the HTML data created in step S.

If the CPU of the game server cannot obtain the power points of the game B of the user U subject to the processing from the game server step S instead of step S the CPU creates HTML data including the banner for starting the execution of the game B in response to the HTTP request in step S step S and transmits the HTML data to the communication terminal of the user U step S . Consequently the web page of the game A is updated on the communication terminal of the user U step S . Although the power points of the game B of the user U are not displayed in the updated web page of the game A the banner for starting the execution of the game B is displayed.

As described above in the game control device of the present embodiment the communication terminal of the user is notified about the power points user information in any of the games B C and etc. second game when the execution condition of the game A first game executed by the user satisfies the first condition. As a result the user executing or about to execute the game A can know the user s own power points for a different game B C and etc. second game and can appropriately judge whether to progress or execute the different game B C and etc. second game .

In the present embodiment the first condition can be suitably set. Preferably as described in the abovementioned embodiment the first condition may satisfy when at least a portion of the game A first game cannot be executed or progressed such as when the quest cannot be executed due to the power points being insufficient. In this case the user for example can appropriately judge whether any of the different games B C and etc. second game can be progressed at the point in time when the user cannot progress the game A.

As described above the user information of the game A first game may be the power points. That is the user information of the game A includes power points parameters that fluctuate in accordance with the game progress and the game A may be a game in which the game progress is hampered when the value of the power points equals or falls below certain range the power points required for conducting the request process and the first condition of the first determining means may be that the value of the power points of the user in the game A first game is within the certain range. At this time the user cannot progress in the game A when the first condition is determined to have been satisfied. Under this state the user information such as the power points for any of the games B C and etc. second game different from the game A becomes particularly convenient for the user to allow the user to start another game according to the user information.

As described in the above embodiment the notifying means may cause user information of a game second game different from the game subject to accessing to be displayed on a game screen of the game A first game subject to accessing. As a result user information such as the power points of a game different from the game A can be quickly recognized when accessing the game A while executing the game A or when the game A cannot be progressed.

Moreover as described in the above embodiment the notifying means may further cause a banner to be displayed for starting the execution of for example the different game B second game . Consequently the user is able to quickly start the game B. For example the user is able to switch in a smooth manner from the game A to the game B at the point in time when the game A cannot be progressed.

Next a second embodiment will be explained. The hardware configuration of the elements the communication terminal the game server and the database server that configure the game system of the present embodiment are the same as those of the first present embodiment. A functional block diagram may have the same functional configuration as that of but the contents of functions of the first determining means differ from the first embodiment as described below.

While the user information of a different game is notified when the power points of the game A by the user is equal to or less than the power points required to execute the request processing in the first embodiment the user information of a different game is notified in a state in which the game A first game cannot be executed. A state in which the game A cannot be executed is a state in which the execution of the game A cannot be started state in which service for the execution of the game A is stopped due to maintenance and the like by the game operator of the game A that the user has accessed. Under this state the user information such as the power points for any of the games B C and etc. second game different from the game A becomes particularly convenient to allow the user can start another game according to the user information.

The first determining means in the present embodiment has a function for determining whether a game A first game state by the user satisfies a first condition. The first condition in the present embodiment is as described above for example may satisfy in a case in which the execution of the game A cannot be started due to maintenance and the like by the game operator of the game A that the user has accessed.

In order to realize the functions of the first determining means of the present embodiment the CPU of the game server receives a HTTP request for logging in from the communication terminal of the user and conducts authentication processing on the basis of unique identification information or a user ID and a password included in the HTTP request. However if the state in which the game A cannot be executed exists the CPU determines that the first condition is satisfied. For example the first condition is satisfied if a state exists in which the execution of the game A cannot be started state in which service for the execution of the game A is stopped due to maintenance and the like by the game operator of the game A. Moreover it is determined that the first condition is satisfied if a state in which the game cannot be executed occurs at a time other than logging in due to maintenance and the like being started while executing the game.

Although not represented in the game control device of the present embodiment may include a state obtaining means for obtaining a state of the game A first game . For example a flag 1 stopped due to maintenance 0 operating indicating an operating state of the game A is provided in the game server and when the flag state is set for example by the game operator the CPU of the game server discerns whether the game A is undergoing maintenance by reading the state of the flag. Herein the above process of reading the state of the flag by the CPU is an implementation example of a function of the state obtaining means.

Similar to the first embodiment the information obtaining means of the present embodiment may refer to a storage device that stores information related to the associations between different games to specify the game B C and etc. second game as the game associated with the game A first game and may obtain the user information of the user of the second game. That is the game from which the user information is obtained by the information obtaining means may be a game associated with the game A first game or may be a game associated with the user subject to the processing.

In another aspect the information obtaining means may refer to a storage device that stores information concerning the associations between games and a user to specify the game B C and etc. second game as the game associated with the user and may obtain the user information of the user of the second game. That is the game from which the user information is obtained by the information obtaining means may be a game associated with the user subject to the processing.

Next an example of a main processing flow conducted by the game system according to the present embodiment will be explained with reference again to the sequence chart in . In the present embodiment the sequence chart in is an example in which the user has logged into the game A and the user information is to be obtained from the game B.

In a HTTP request specifying a uniform resource locator URL for a specific user U to log into the game A is transmitted to the game server step S . When the CPU of the game server receives the HTTP request of step S the CPU determines that the first condition is satisfied since the game A cannot be executed due to maintenance step S YES . If the game A is executable step S NO the routine advances to step S and the CPU of the game server refers to the user data of the user U and creates HTML data for displaying the top page of the game A of the user U step S .

When the first condition is determined to have been satisfied in step S the CPU of the game server controls the API server of the game server to create a request for obtaining power points example of user information of the game B of the user U subject to the processing from the API server of the game server that is the server executing the game B step S . As a result the above request is sent from the API server of the game server to the API server of the game server step S . The user ID of the user U subject to the processing is included in the request. The CPU of the game server that receives the request extracts the power points as user information from the user data using the user ID subject to the request as a key step S . The API server of the game server returns to the API server of the game server a response that includes the value of the power points user information in the game B of the user U subject to the processing step S .

The CPU of the game server obtains the power points of the game B of the user U subject to the processing from the game server creates HTML data including the power points of the game B in response to a HTTP request of the step S step S and transmits the HTML data to the communication terminal of the user U step S . Text for notifying that the game A cannot be executed due to maintenance is included in the HTML data. When the HTML data is received a web page of the game A is displayed on the communication terminal of the user U step S .

An example of a web page displayed in step S is represented in . A display area for notifying the user the fact that the game A is undergoing maintenance and a guidance area are displayed in the web page exemplified in . The display format of the guidance area in the web page in is the same as for example that of and preferably includes a banner for starting the execution of the game B.

If the CPU of the game server cannot obtain the power points of the game B of the user U subject to the processing from the game server step S instead of step S the CPU creates HTML data including the banner for starting the execution of the game B in response to the HTTP request in step S step S and transmits the HTML data to the communication terminal of the user U step S . Consequently a web page of the game A is displayed on the communication terminal of the user U step S . Although the power points of the game B of the user U are not displayed in the displayed web page of the game A the banner for starting the execution of the game B is included.

As described above in the game control device of the present embodiment the communication terminal of the user is notified about the power points user information in any of the games B C and etc. second game when the condition of the game A first game satisfies the first condition for example when the game A cannot be executed due to maintenance and the like . As a result the user about to execute the game A can know the user s own power points for a different game B C and etc. second game and can appropriately judge whether to progress or execute the different game B C and etc. second game .

Next a third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The hardware configuration of the elements the communication terminal the game server and the database server that configure the game system of the present embodiment are the same as those of the first present embodiment.

A functional block diagram of the game control device of the present embodiment is represented in . As represented in the present embodiment differs from the first embodiment due to the addition of a selecting means . The selecting means includes functions for obtaining user registration information from a storage device that stores registration information related to users referring to the registration information and selecting one or a plurality of games from any of the games B C and etc. second game that are different from the game A that is accessed by the user. Herein the registration information may be information for example that indicates an attribute of a user such as the gender or age of the user and the information related to the gender of the user is particularly preferred.

The location of the storage device for storing the user registration information in the game system of the present embodiment may be set appropriately. For example the storage device for storing the user registration information may be the database server user database if the game servers corresponding to the games obtain the registration information on the basis of a selection operation input by the user when user registration is being conducted. Additionally when a host server not represented in connected to the game servers corresponding to the games is provided and the host server issues a shared user ID that is recognizable by the game servers and the registration information such as the shared user ID and user attributes is stored in an associated manner in the host server the storage device for storing the user registration information may be a large capacity storage device such as a hard disk drive HDD in the host server.

An example of a method for realizing the functions of the selecting means will be explained with reference to a flow chart in. . is a flow chart representing an example of processing for selecting on the basis of registry information. Herein follows an explanation of processing executed by the CPU of the game server in the flow chart in . It is assumed that information related to the gender of the user is included in the user registration information.

If the user registration information is stored in the user database the CPU of the game server accesses the user database and reads the user registration information subject to the processing step S . If the user registration information is stored in the host server as described above the CPU of the game server obtains the registration information by communicating with the host server. In this case the game servers may periodically e.g. once a day receive the user registration information from the host server or the game servers may send a request for the user registration information to the host server as needed so that the host server returns a response including the user registration information to the game servers in response to the request. In this case communication between the game servers and the host server may use a Web API based on HTTP.

Next the CPU of the game server evaluates the information related to the gender of the users included in the registration information. If the user subject to the processing is male step S YES the CPU of the game server selects a game with a certain probability from a plurality of games that are male oriented or gender free step S . For example if the plurality of games that are male oriented or gender free consist of the games D E and F the probability of the CPU of the game server selecting a game is exemplified below. However the probability can also be set arbitrarily.

The above example represents a case in which the probability of being selected is the same for the selection candidates but the present invention is not limited to this case. The probability may be appropriately adjusted so that the probability of a game for preferably guiding inducing the user to being selected becomes higher.

If the user subject to the processing is female step S NO the CPU of the game server selects a game with a certain probability from among a plurality of games that are female oriented or gender free step S . The selection method is the same as that of the step S.

In the flow chart represented in the information related to the gender of the user is assumed to be included in the user registration information but the user registration information is not limited to the gender of the user. The user registration information may include information related to age. The flow chart for selecting a game in this case may adopt the same configuration as that of . That is when using a certain threshold as a standard the CPU of the game server selects a game from a plurality of games for older users or games that do not depend on age when the age of the user is high or the CPU selects a game from a plurality of games for younger users or games that do not depend on age when the age of the user is lower. The probability of selecting a game may be the same as described above.

Next an example of a main processing flow conducted by the game system according to the present embodiment will be explained with reference to the sequence chart in . is a sequence chart representing an example of processing for exhibiting information about a game different from the game that is being played to a user in the game control device according to the present embodiment.

The sequence chart in is an example in which the user is executing the game A and the user information is to be obtained from the game B in the same way as in . The point of difference with is that step S is added. When the first condition is determined to be satisfied in step S in the sequence chart in the CPU of the game server for example selects a game on the basis of the registration information of the user U subject to the processing based on the processing represented in step S . It is assumed herein that the game B is selected. In this case the CPU of the game server controls the API server of the game server to send a request for obtaining power points example of user information of the game B of the user U subject to the processing to the API server of the game server that is the server executing the game B. The subsequent processing is the same as that of .

In the game system of the present embodiment a user can be induced to execute a game suited to that user by the game server of the game A first game accessed by the user selecting any of the different games B C and etc. second game on the basis of the registration information of the user. Consequently the user is able to switch in a smooth manner from the game A to the different game at the point in time when the game A cannot be progressed.

Next a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The hardware configuration of the elements the communication terminal the game server and the database server that configure the game system of the present embodiment are the same as those of the first present embodiment.

A functional block diagram of the game control device of the present embodiment is represented in . As represented in the present embodiment differs from the first embodiment due to the addition of a second determining means . The second determining means includes the function of determining whether power points user information obtained by the information obtaining means of the user for a game that is different from the game accessed by the user satisfy a second condition.

In order to realize the functions of the second determining means the CPU of the game server obtains the power points user information of the user for a game different from the game accessed by the user and determines whether the power points satisfy the second condition. For example when 8 power points are needed to execute the quest once in the different game and the power points of the user in the different game are 8 or more the second condition is satisfied since the quest can be executed at least once by consuming the power points.

Although a case in which the game accessed by the user first game and the different game second game are each configured to conduct quest processing herein the present invention is not limited as such. The data that is the basis for the first determining means to determine the first condition and the second determining means to determine the second condition may be different since the games themselves may be different and the functions provided in the games may be different.

In the present embodiment when the second determining means determines that the second condition is satisfied the notifying means may notify the user about the user s power points user information of the game second game that is different from the game accessed by the user.

Next an example of a main processing flow conducted by the game system according to the present embodiment will be explained with reference to the sequence chart in . is a sequence chart representing an example of processing for exhibiting to a user information about a game different from the game that is being played in the game control device according to the present embodiment.

The sequence chart in is an example in which the user is executing the game A and the user information is to be obtained from the game B in the same way as .

When in response to the HTTP request step S from the specific communication terminal of the user U the first condition is determined to have been satisfied that is the quest cannot be executed without the power points being reduced in step S the CPU of the game server executing the game A controls the API server of the game server to create a request for obtaining power points example of user information of the games B C D and etc. of the user U subject to the processing for the API server of the game servers and etc. that respectively execute the games B C D and etc. step S . As a result the above request is sent from the API server of the game server to the API servers of the game servers and etc. step S . The user ID of the user U subject to the processing is included in the request. The CPUs of the game servers and etc. that receive the request extract the power points as user information from the user data using the user ID subject to the request as a key step S . The API servers of the game servers and etc. return a response including the values of the power points in the games B C D and etc. of the user U subject to the processing to the API server of the game server step S .

The CPU of the game server obtains the power points of the games B C D and etc. of the user U subject to the processing from the game server and determines whether the second condition is satisfied step S . For example if the power points of the user U in the games B C D and etc. are equal to or greater than the power points needed to execute the quest of each game once the second condition is determined to be satisfied. When a game in which the second condition is satisfied exists step S YES the CPU of the game server may select any of the games or a certain number of the games from the games in which the second condition is satisfied with for example the method exemplified in the second embodiment step S . Next the CPU of the game server creates HTML data including the power points of the game selected in step S one or a plurality of games from the games B C D and etc. in response to the HTTP request of the step S step S and transmits the HTML data to the communication terminal of the user U step S . Consequently a web page of the game A is updated on the communication terminal of the user U step S . The power points of the game selected in step S are included in the updated web page of the game A. When the response of step S is received a banner for starting the execution of the game selected in step S is preferably included in the HTML data created in step S.

The selection of the game in step S is not absolutely necessary and the power points of all the games in which the second condition is satisfied and a banner for all the games may be included in the HTML data.

In the present embodiment as described above the power points user information of the games B C D and etc. second game different from the game A first game that is accessed are not notified to the user in a random manner. The user may be notified about power points of a suitable second game by notifying the user of the power points when the second condition is satisfied. As a result the power points of the second game in which the quest can be executed can be notified and the user can recognize the fact that a different game can be progressed at the point in time that the game A cannot be progressed.

In the present embodiment an explanation will follow of a system configuration different from the game systems in the first to fourth embodiments.

The supervisory server in the present embodiment manages in an integrated manner the user information and the registration information of the game servers . In other words the user information related to the games in which the users are registered is managed by the supervisory server . For example when user information such as the power points are updated in the game servers the supervisory server is successively notified and the user information is stored and updated in a large capacity storage device not represented and the like in the supervisory server . When exchanging the user information between the game servers the game server intending to obtain the user information transmits a request including a user ID and the game for which the user information is to be obtained to the supervisory server and the supervisory server returns a response that includes the user information of the user ID in accordance with the request. That is the supervisory server includes a storage means for obtaining user information about the users of the games and storing and updating the user information in a large capacity storage device and a provision means for providing the user information about any of the games of the specified user to the server.

The feature of not conducting direct data exchange through the API servers of the game servers is different from the game systems in the first to fourth embodiments.

When the information obtaining means in one game control device obtains user information from another game control device that is when user information is exchanged directly between game control devices as described in the first to fourth embodiments there is an advantage that traffic is reduced since information is exchanged without passing through another device.

When the information obtaining means in a game control device obtains user information managed in another game control device through an information management device having the user information of a plurality of games there is an advantage that the user information can be reliably obtained from the information management device even if for example communication between the game control devices is hampered.

The exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been explained in detail. However the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned exemplary embodiments. Further it is apparent that a variety of changes and modifications can be made for the respective exemplary embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention. The technical features described in the above embodiments may be appropriately combined.

Although a case in which the user information e.g. power points is displayed in a game image such as a web page and the like as an aspect of notifying the user about the user information has been described in the above embodiments the aspect of notifying the user information is not limited to displaying. The method of notifying the user about the user information may include a method of outputting the user information by sound. In this case HTML data that includes compressed audio signals of the user information may be transmitted from the game servers to the communication device so that the sound may be outputted by decompressing and amplifying the compressed audio signals in the communication device . Causing the user information to be displayed as described in the above embodiments is preferred as an aspect of notifying. By employing a method of displaying the user information in a game image the user is able to recognize the game images even in an environment e.g. in a public transportation facility where for example the output of sound is restricted. Furthermore the user may fail to hear the user information when outputting the user information by sound and thus unreliability of transmitting the information can be reduced by displaying the user information.

Although power points for progression of the game have been raised as an example of the user information in the above embodiments the user information to be obtained may be appropriately set in the game properties and the first determining means in accordance with the contents of the first condition.

For example in the case of a battle game in which the attack strength and defense strength of a game character fluctuate in accordance with the progress of the game the user information may be a value of a game character parameter that indicates the attack strength or the defense strength.

Further although a condition of not being able to progress in the game since the quest cannot be executed has been exemplified as the first condition in the above embodiments the present invention is not limited to such a condition. For example even though the game A can be progressed while the user is accessing the game A e.g. the quest can be executed the user information of a game other than the game A may be obtained and the user may be notified about the user information when a break occurs in the game A e.g. a time when a search in a specific area of the quest is completed or at periodical times after the game A has been accessed e.g. at ten minute intervals . That is the first condition may be after a certain time period has elapsed or may be when a position of a break in the game A has been reached due to the progression in the game A by the user.

For example when an event aimed at the user occurs in a game other than the game A such as when a friend application addressed to the user accessing the game A is received in a game other than the game A or when an application or response for a trade addressed to the user occurs the contents of that event may be notified as user information. Based on this type of notification the user accessing the game A can access the other game at a suitable time to perform the required operation.

Further the user information can be appropriately set in accordance with the game. For example in an example of a game in which a user uses fertilizer and the like to grow crops a determination may be made as to whether the progress state of the game satisfies the first condition when the user s fertilizer is used up namely the game cannot be progressed .

To simplify understanding of the abovementioned embodiments the game functions executed by the game servers have been described as shared. However the games executed by the game servers may each have different functions i.e. games with different properties . That is the first condition determined by one game server and the user information extracted by another game server can be set independently of each other and the games executed by the game servers are not required to have shared functions. For example if the power points are determined to have satisfied the first condition in the game server the user information provided by the game server may be user information about a game not related in any way with the quest e.g. the abovementioned growth level of the crops .

The notifying means in the game control device may display information indicating that the first condition has been satisfied on a web page game image in addition to displaying the user information in a game image. Any method can be used as a display method such as a display with text as described in the abovementioned embodiments or a display with a mark or other pattern. Consequently it is convenient for the user since the required information is displayed with a single game image. Moreover the time when an executed game cannot be continued and executed is a time that another game can be played another game can be executed . However the importance of the display of the information of the other game increases when considering which game to play instead when notified that the game that is being executed cannot be continued.

Although a certain operation input on the communication terminal by the user is assumed to be an input of a pressing operation of a certain operating button on the user s communication terminal or an input of a touch operation on a display screen on a communication terminal that includes a touch panel function in the abovementioned embodiments the operation input is not limited as such. The operation input may be an operation input caused by shaking a communication terminal that includes an acceleration sensor or may be an operation input based on a gesture gesture input . With a gesture input the communication terminal recognizes the gesture through image recognition by performing a certain gesture to the communication terminal that includes an imaging function and recognizes operation inputs previously associated with gestures. Moreover the operation input may be conducted by inputting a sound if the communication terminal is able to execute a sound recognition program.

Although communication between the game servers or between the game servers and the supervisory server has been described as performed by using HTTP through a Web API in the above embodiments the present invention is not limited as such. A known wired or wireless communication protocol may be appropriately used.

Although an example of the present invention as applied to a social networking game has been described in the abovementioned embodiments the present invention is not limited as such. For example it goes without saying that a game progression by users can be controlled in the same way as the abovementioned embodiments when a server device provided on a network and a household online game device are connected as a so called online game system.

Although a configuration has been described in which the functions of the game executing means the first determining means the information obtaining means the notifying means the selecting means and the second determining means are realized by the game servers and the database servers on a network the present invention is not limited to this configuration. At least a portion of the means may be configured to be realized by the communication terminal . In order for the communication terminal and the game servers to use substantially the same hardware configuration the functions can be realized by the communication terminal as described in the embodiments. each represent examples of distribution of the functions functions represented in of the game control device of the present embodiment between the communication terminal and the game servers and the database servers .
