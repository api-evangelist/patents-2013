The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates to a system for sharing electrical power between two discrete articles and in one particular embodiment a system for transferring electrical power by inductive magnetic coupling between an article of clothing and an electrically powered device in which a high magnetic permeability material is directly integrated into a fastening mechanism to increase the magnetic coupling and to improve the power transfer between the articles.

In many applications such as military applications it is necessary to transfer electrical power from one discrete article and to another. For example self contained electrical energy storage devices and electrically powered devices may be separately attached to an article of clothing worn by a soldier.

In many cases it is necessary to transfer electrical energy from a self contained electrical energy storage device to an electrically powered device such as a flashlight radio and or the like. For example the electrical storage device or battery contained within the electrically powered device may become depleted during use. In order to recharge the electrical storage device contained within the electrically powered device it has been traditionally necessary for the soldier to physically and electrically connect the device to a self contained electrical energy storage device.

In order to connect the electrically powered device to the self contained electrical energy storage device it has been previously necessary to route a cable through an article of clothing and to physically plug cable connectors into both the self contained electrical energy storage device and the electrically powered device. Such a procedure however is oftentimes impractical or simply too time consuming. In other cases the fasteners or cables may become lost or damaged.

The present invention provides a system for transferring electrical power data or both by way of magnetic induction between a first article and a second article which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known devices.

In brief a first electrically conductive coil is integrated into the first article such as an article of clothing. This first coil may be connectable to an electrical energy storage or providing device like a battery.

Similarly a second electrically conductive coil is integrated to the second article such as an electrically powered device. This second coil may also be connectable to an electrical energy storage or providing device.

The system further includes a fastener comprising ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material. The fastener is configured to be positioned through the first coil and the second coil to provide an efficient magnetic conductance path between the first coil and the second coil and to removably secure the first article and the second article together.

An electrical control circuit energizes one of the first and second coils with an alternating current flow. The alternating flow of electrical current through the coil results in an alternating magnetic field that is particularly concentrated in the center of the coil. The alternating magnetic field causes an alternating magnetization of the ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material of the fastener. The alternating magnetization of the fastener in turn induces a voltage in the second coil. An electrical control circuit may be connected to the first coil or second coil then through a rectifier circuit.

The transfer of electrical energy or data may be in either direction i.e. from the electrical system associated with the first article and to the second article or vice versa. Furthermore the fastener used to transfer the alternating magnetic field from one coil and to the other may also serve to removably secure the second article to the first article.

With reference first to a block diagrammatic view of one energy transfer system according to the present invention is shown. The system includes a first article such as an article of clothing for instance. The article of clothing may be formed of conventional fabric and textile materials such as cotton wool linen silk synthetic fabric materials e.g. nylon and polyester blends thereof or the like. In various embodiments the article of clothing may be a shirt pants shorts sweater coat jacket vest helmet hat sock boot shoe belt etc. which are worn by a person. For instance articles of clothing may be fatigues or military type wear combat type clothing such as the Army Combat Uniform ACU Navy Working Uniform NWU Airman Battle Uniform AMU Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform MCCUU Coast Guard Operational Dress Uniform ODU older style military Battle Dress Uniforms BDU or the like. Clothing may also be uniforms and other dress for civilians and first responders such as typically worn by police fire fighters emergency medical technicians EMT doctors paramedics construction workmen postal workers for instance. And clothing may also be recreational wear such as that typically used for camping hiking hunting and fishing boating bicycle riding motorcycle riding horseback riding skiing etc. While the aforementioned articles concern clothing it will be appreciated that in other embodiments other articles may be provided such as a backpack knapsack rucksack harness etc. which can be carried by a person and or otherwise provided.

An electrical energy storage or providing device such as a battery may be integrated into the article of clothing to power the electrical systems. The energy storage or providing device may be a chargeable capacitor photovoltaic cell or a fuel cell in some embodiments.

With reference to the battery may be alternatively integrated into a third article which is fastened to the article of clothing using a second fastener to also transfer energy from the battery in article to the article of clothing .

With reference now to a first coil constructed of an electrically conductive material is integrated into the article of clothing . For example as illustrated in the coil may be formed of wire that is integrally woven into the article of clothing .

The first coil is connected through an alternating current control rectifier circuit to the battery . In a first mode of operation in which the article of clothing is transferring electrical power from the clothing to an external device the circuit operates as an alternating current control and produces alternating current to the first coil from the power contained within the battery . Alternatively when the electrical system for the article of clothing is receiving electrical power the circuit operates as a rectifier and rectifies current from the coil for storage in the battery or other energy storage or providing device such as a capacitor.

With reference now to the system further includes a second article such as an electrically powered device which could be a radio mobile cellular telephone personal digital assistant PDA computer signaling device a global positioning system GPS unit flashlight etc. for instance. The electrically powered device includes a second coil constructed of an electrically conductive material with could be integrated into electrically powered device . This second coil may be connected directly or indirectly through an alternating current control rectifier circuit to an energy storage or providing device or battery . Like the alternating current control rectifier circuit associated with the article of clothing the alternating current control rectifier circuit contained in or on the electrically powered device also operates in two modes. In one mode the alternating current control provides alternating current to the second coil from electrical power stored in the battery during transfer of power from the electrically powered device and to the article of clothing . Conversely when the electrically powered device receives electrical power from the electrical system of the article of clothing the circuit operates as a rectifier to rectify the alternating current induced in the second coil for subsequent storage in the battery .

In addition to transferring electrical power data may additionally or alternatively be transferred in a similar manner over the same coils. For example audio data or computer data may be transferred in this manner.

With reference now to in order to efficiently transfer power or data between the article of clothing and the electrically powered device a fastener constructed of a high permeability ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material is attached to the electrically powered device . The fastener may be constructed entirely or at least partially from ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron or ferrite for providing an efficient magnetic conductance path between the first coil and the second coil . In some instances the central portion of the fastener may be fabricated from such material in the form of a generally rigid or solid core and in the case of a flexible fastener like a strap it may be formed of a flexible foil of ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material.

In addition the fastener is configured to removably secure the first and second articles together. In some embodiments as shown the fastener may be configured as a clip which is generally U shaped and includes two legs and which abut against each other at their free ends. The leg on the fastener is positioned through the second coil on the electrically powered device . When the fastener is coupled to the article of clothing as shown in the second leg of the fastener extends through the first coil woven into the article of clothing . For example the fastener may be hooked onto an attachment portion such as a pocket gusset pleat webbing or the like formed on the article of clothing in the vicinity of the first coil . In some embodiments the attachment portion may include webbing having one or more loops configured for use with Modular Lightweight Load carrying Equipment MOLLE Pouch Attachment Ladder System PALS and All Purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment ALICE typically used by the military. Webbing loops of this kind may be stitched or otherwise attached to the surface of the article of clothing they may be elastic in nature.

In doing so the fastener not only serves to attach the electrically powered device to the article of clothing but also serves as an efficient magnetic conductance path between the first coil and second coil . Thus an alternating current in one of the first or second coils effectively induces an alternating current in the other coil. The fastener enables the device to be readily removed from the article of clothing for instance by sliding the device upwards. Alternatively in other orientations the fastener might be slid downward sideways or in some other direction. It may be designed to have a degree of resilience to better engage the fabric of the clothing. For example in some embodiments the fastener may be a clip or a strap. Such fasteners can readily and removable couple to an attachment portion on an article of clothing with the clip or strap passing through an attachment portion e.g. webbing formed on the article of clothing . Additional fasteners such as hook and loop type fastener e.g. Velcro buttons snaps or the like may further my provided on either a clip or strap for a more secure connection if needed. shows the clip fastener being slipped over and through a loop of the webbing formed on the article of clothing .

With reference to the U shape of the fastener may be advantageous so that the magnetic field strength illustrated by field lines is concentrated within the fastener. The air gap separates the core to allow leg to be inserted through coil . After insertion the gap closes partially or fully for maximum magnetic field containment.

With reference to the magnetic fastener may alternatively be substantially flat in shape. In this case the single leg of the fastener is inserted through both coil and coil .

With reference to the alternative flat shape of the fastener directs the magnetic field from the transmitting coil through the receiving coil but the field line closes back through the open environment.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a simple yet effective system for transferring electrical power data or both between an electrical system contained within an article of clothing and a separate electrically powered device. Furthermore in some embodiments of the invention the system selectively transfers electrical energy and or data from the electrical system contained in the article of clothing and to the discrete electrically powered device or vice versa. However it may be desired that the electrical transfer be conducted in a single direction. For example it may only be desired to transfer power or data from the electrical system integrated with the article of clothing and to the electrically powered device but not vice versa. In this case it would not be necessary to have an alternating current control circuit in the electrically powered device .

Embodiments of the present invention may also provide a safety mechanism for operation of the electrically powered device . For example if and when the fastener becomes removed from the article of clothing whether intentionally or unintentionally power and or data transfer will become immediately interrupted between the article of clothing and the electrically powered device .

Having described our invention many modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
