The building subsystems may include a building electrical subsystem an information communication technology ICT subsystem a security subsystem a HVAC subsystem a lighting subsystem a lift escalators subsystem and a fire safety subsystem . The building subsystems can include fewer additional or alternative subsystems. For example building subsystems may also or alternatively include a refrigeration subsystem an advertising or signage system subsystem a cooking subsystem a vending subsystem or a printer or copy service subsystem. Conventionally these systems are autonomous and managed by separate control systems. The smart building manager described herein is configured to achieve energy consumption and energy demand reductions by integrating the management of the building subsystems.

In an exemplary embodiment the smart building manager is configured to include a communications interface to the smart grid outside the building an interface to disparate subsystems within a building e.g. HVAC lighting security lifts power distribution business etc. and an interface to applications network or local for allowing user control and the monitoring and adjustment of the smart building manager or subsystems . Enterprise control applications may be configured to provide subsystem spanning control to a graphical user interface GUI or to any number of enterprise level business applications e.g. accounting systems user identification systems etc. . Enterprise control applications may also or alternatively be configured to provide configuration GUIs for configuring the smart building manager . In yet other embodiments enterprise control applications can work with layers to optimize building performance e.g. efficiency energy use comfort or safety based on inputs received at the interface to the smart grid and the interface to building subsystems . In an exemplary embodiment smart building manager is integrated within a single computer e.g. one server one housing etc. . In various other exemplary embodiments the smart building manager can be distributed across multiple servers or computers e.g. that can exist in distributed locations .

Communications interfaces can be or include wired or wireless interfaces e.g. jacks antennas transmitters receivers transceivers wire terminals etc. for conducting data communications with e.g. smart grid energy providers and purchasers building subsystems or other external sources via a direct connection or a network connection e.g. an Internet connection a LAN WAN or WLAN connection etc. . For example communications interfaces can include an Ethernet card and port for sending and receiving data via an Ethernet based communications link or network. In another example communications interfaces can include a WiFi transceiver for communicating via a wireless communications network. In another example one or both of interfaces may include cellular or mobile phone communications transceivers. In one embodiment communications interface is a power line communications interface and communications interface is an Ethernet interface. In other embodiments both communications interface and communications interface are Ethernet interfaces or are the same Ethernet interface. Further while shows applications and as existing outside of smart building manager in some embodiments applications and may be hosted within smart building manager generally or memory device more particularly.

Referring further to the building subsystem integration layer is configured to manage communications between the rest of the smart building manager s components and the building subsystems. The building subsystem integration layer may also be configured to manage communications between building subsystems. The building subsystem integration layer may be configured to translate communications e.g. sensor data input signals output signals etc. across a plurality of multi vendor multi protocol systems. For example the building subsystem integration layer may be configured to integrate data from subsystems .

In the building subsystem integration layer is shown in greater detail to include a message format and content normalization component . The message format and content normalization component is configured to convert data messages for and from disparately protocolled devices or networks e.g. different building subsystems differently protocolled smart grid sources etc. . The message format and content normalization component is shown to include two subcomponents an application normalization component and a building subsystem normalization component . The application normalization component is a computer function object service or combination thereof configured to drive the conversion of communications for and from applications e.g. enterprise level applications shown in a computerized maintenance management system utility company applications via smart grid shown in etc. . The building subsystem normalization component is a computer function object service or combination thereof configured to drive the conversion of communications for and from building subsystems e.g. building subsystems shown in building subsystem controllers building devices security systems fire systems etc. . The application normalization component and the building subsystem normalization component are configured to accommodate multiple communications or data protocols. In some embodiments the application normalization component and the building subsystem normalization component are configured to conduct the conversion for each protocol based on information stored in modules e.g. a table a script in memory device shown in for each of systems or devices . The protocol modules may be for example schema maps or other descriptions of how a message for one protocol should be translated to a message for a second protocol. In some embodiments the modules may be plug in drivers that can be easily installed to or removed from a building subsystem integration layer e.g. via an executable installation routine by placing a file in an interfaces folder etc. during setup. For example modules may be vendor specific e.g. Johnson Controls Honeywell Siemens etc. standards based e.g. BACnet ANSI C12.19 Lon Works Modbus RIP SNMP SOAP web services HTML HTTP HTTPS XML XAML TFTP DHCP DNS SMTP SNTP etc. user built user selected and or user customized. In some embodiments the application normalization component or building subsystem normalization component are configured for compatibility with new modules or drivers e.g. user defined or provided by a vendor or third party . In such embodiments message format and content normalization component may advantageously be scaled for future applications or case specific requirements e.g. situations calling for the use of additional cyber security standards such as data encryption decryption by changing the active module set or by installing a new module.

Using message format and content normalization component the building subsystem integration layer can be configured to provide a service oriented architecture for providing cross subsystem control activities and cross subsystem applications. The message format and content normalization component can be configured to provide a relatively small number of straightforward interfaces e.g. application programming interfaces APIs or protocols e.g. open protocols unified protocols common protocols for use by layers shown in or external applications e.g. shown in and to hide such layers or applications from the complexities of the underlying subsystems and their particular data transport protocols data formats semantics interaction styles and the like. Configuration of the message format and content normalization component may occur automatically e.g. via a building subsystem and device discovery process via user configuration or by a combination of automated discovery and user configuration. User configuration may be driven by providing one or more graphical user interfaces or wizards to a user the graphical user interfaces allowing the user to map an attribute from one protocol to an attribute of another protocol. Configuration tool shown in may be configured to drive such an association process. The configuration tool may be served to clients local or remote via web services and or GUI engine both shown in . The configuration tool may be provided as a thin web client e.g. that primarily interfaces with web services or a thick client e.g. that only occasionally draws upon web services and or GUI engine . Configuration tool may be configured to use a W3C standard intended to harmonize semantic information from different systems to controllably define describe and store relationships between the data protocols e.g. define the modules . For example the W3C standard used may be the Web Ontology Language OWL . In some exemplary embodiments configuration tool may be configured to prepare the message format and content normalization component and device protocol modules thereof for machine level interoperability of data content.

Once the building subsystem integration layer is configured developers of applications may be provided with a software development kit to allow rapid development of applications compatible with the smart building manager e.g. with an application facing protocol or API of the building subsystem integration layer . Such an API or application facing protocol may be exposed at the enterprise integration layer shown in . In various exemplary embodiments the smart building manager including building subsystem integration layer includes the following features or advantages seamless in that heterogeneous applications and subsystems may be integrated without varying or affecting the behavior of the external facing interfaces or logic open in that it allows venders to develop products and applications by coding adapters e.g. modules shown in or features according to a well defined specification multi standard in that it supports subsystems that operate according to standards as well as proprietary protocols extensible in that it accommodates new applications and subsystems with little to no modification scalable in that it supports many applications and subsystems adaptable in that it allows for the addition or deletion of applications or subsystems without affecting system consistency user configurable in that it is adjustable to changes in the business environment business rules or business workflows and secure in that it protects information transferred through the integration channel. Additional details with respect to building subsystem integration layer are described below with respect to .

Referring further to the integrated control layer is configured to use the data input and or output of the building subsystem integration layer to make control decisions. Due to the subsystem integration provided by the building subsystem integration layer the integrated control layer can integrate control activities of the subsystems such that the subsystems behave as a single integrated supersystem. In an exemplary embodiment the integrated control layer includes control logic that uses inputs and outputs from a plurality of building subsystems to provide greater comfort and energy savings relative to the comfort and energy savings that separate subsystems could provide alone. For example information from a first building subsystem may be used to control a second building subsystem. By way of a more particular example when a building employee badges in at a parking garage a message may be sent from the parking subsystem to the building subsystem integration layer converted into an event recognized as a universal occupancy e.g. badge in event and provided to integrated control layer . Integrated control layer may include logic that turns on the lights in the building employee s office begins cooling the building employee s office in response to the anticipated occupancy and boots up the employee s computer. The decision to turn the devices on is made by integrated control layer and integrated control layer may cause proper on commands to be forwarded to the particular subsystems e.g. the lighting subsystem the IT subsystem the HVAC subsystem . The integrated control layer passes the on commands through building subsystem integration layer so that the messages are properly formatted or protocolled for receipt and action by the subsystems. As is illustrated in the integrated control layer is logically above the building subsystems and building subsystem controllers. The integrated control layer by having access to information from multiple systems is configured to use inputs from one or more building subsystems to make control decisions for control algorithms of other building subsystems. For example the badge in event described above can be used by the integrated control layer e.g. a control algorithm thereof to provide new setpoints to an HVAC control algorithm of the HVAC subsystem.

While conventional building subsystem controllers are only able to process inputs that are directly relevant to the performance of their own control loops the integrated control layer is configured to use an input from a first subsystem to make an energy saving control decision for a second subsystem. Results of these decisions can be communicated back to the building subsystem integration layer via for example the message format and content normalization component shown in . Therefore advantageously regardless of the particular HVAC system or systems connected to the smart building manager and due to the normalization at the building subsystem integration layer the integrated control layer s control algorithms can determine a control strategy using normalized temperature inputs and provide an output including a normalized setpoint temperature to the building subsystem integration layer. The building subsystem integration layer can translate the normalized setpoint temperature into a command specific to the building subsystem or controller for which the setpoint adjustment is intended. If multiple subsystems are utilized to complete the same function e.g. if multiple disparately protocolled HVAC subsystems are provided in different regions of a building the building subsystem integration layer can convert a command decision e.g. to lower the temperature setpoint by 2 degrees to multiple different commands for receipt and action by the multiple disparately protocolled HVAC subsystems. In this way functions of the integrated control layer may be executed using the capabilities of building subsystem integration layer . In an exemplary embodiment the integrated control layer is configured to conduct the primary monitoring of system and subsystem statuses and interrelationships for the building. Such monitoring can cross the major energy consuming subsystems of a building to allow for cross subsystem energy savings to be achieved e.g. by the demand response layer .

The integrated control layer is shown to be logically below the demand response layer . The integrated control layer is configured to enhance the effectiveness of the demand response layer by enabling building subsystems and their respective control loops to be controlled in coordination with the demand response layer . This configuration may advantageously provide much less disruptive demand response behavior than conventional systems. For example the integrated control layer may be configured to assure that a demand response driven upward adjustment to the setpoint for chilled water temperature or another component that directly or indirectly affects temperature does not result in an increase in fan energy or other energy used to cool a space that would result in greater total building energy use than was saved at the chiller. The integrated control layer may also be configured to provide feedback to the demand response layer so that the demand response layer may check that constraints e.g. temperature lighting levels etc. are properly maintained even while demanded load shedding is in progress. The constraints may also include setpoint or sensed boundaries relating to safety equipment operating limits and performance comfort fire codes electrical codes energy codes and the like. The integrated control layer is also logically below the fault detection and diagnostics layer and the automated measurement and validation layer . The integrated control layer may be configured to provide calculated inputs e.g. aggregations to these higher levels based on outputs from more than one building subsystem.

Control activities that may be completed by the integrated control layer e.g. software modules or control algorithms thereof include occupancy based control activities. Security systems such as radio frequency location systems RFLS access control systems and video surveillance systems can provide detailed occupancy information to the integrated control layer and other building subsystems via the smart building manager and more particularly via the building subsystem integration layer . Integration of an access control subsystem and a security subsystem for a building may provide detailed occupancy data for consumption by the integrated control layer e.g. beyond binary occupied or unoccupied data available to some conventional HVAC systems that rely on for example a motion sensor . For example the exact number of occupants in the building or building zone floor conference room etc. may be provided to the integrated control layer or aggregated by the integrated control layer using inputs from a plurality of subsystems. The exact number of occupants in the building can be used by the integrated control layer to determine and command appropriate adjustments for building subsystems such as HVAC subsystem or lighting subsystem . Integrated control layer may be configured to use the number of occupants for example to determine how many of the available elevators to activate in a building. If the building is only 20 occupied the integrated control layer for example may be configured to power down 80 of the available elevators for energy savings. Further occupancy data may be associated with individual workspaces e.g. cubicles offices desks workstations etc. and if a workspace is determined to be unoccupied by the integrated control layer a control algorithm of the integrated control layer may allow for the energy using devices serving the workspace to be turned off or commanded to enter a low power mode. For example workspace plug loads task lighting computers and even phone circuits may be affected based on a determination by the integrated control layer that the employee associated with the workspace is on vacation e.g. using data inputs received from a human resources subsystem . Significant electrical loads may be shed by the integrated control layer including for example heating and humidification loads cooling and dehumidification loads ventilation and fan loads electric lighting and plug loads e.g. with secondary thermal loads electric elevator loads and the like. The integrated control layer may further be configured to integrate an HVAC subsystem or a lighting subsystem with sunlight shading devices or other smart window technologies. Natural day lighting can significantly offset lighting loads but for optimal comfort may be controlled by the integrated control layer to prevent glare or over lighting. Conversely shading devices and smart windows may also be controlled by the integrated control layer to calculably reduce solar heat gains in a building space which can have a significant impact on cooling loads. Using feedback from sensors in the space and with knowledge of the HVAC control strategy the integrated control layer may further be configured to control the transmission of infrared radiation into the building minimizing thermal transmission when the HVAC subsystem is cooling and maximizing thermal transmission when the HVAC subsystem is heating. As a further example of an occupancy based control strategy that may be implemented by the integrated control layer inputs from a video security subsystem may be analyzed by a control algorithm of the integrated control layer to make a determination regarding occupancy of a building space. Using the determination the control algorithm may turn off the lights adjust HVAC set points power down ICT devices serving the space reduce ventilation and the like enabling energy savings with an acceptable loss of comfort to occupants of the building space.

Referring now to a detailed diagram of a portion of smart building manager is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. In particular illustrates a detailed embodiment of integrated control layer . Configuration tools can allow a user to define e.g. via graphical user interfaces via prompt driven wizards etc. how the integrated control layer should react to changing conditions in the building subsystems . In an exemplary embodiment configuration tools allow a user to build and store condition response scenarios that can cross multiple building subsystems and multiple enterprise control applications e.g. work order management system applications entity resource planning ERP applications etc. .

Building subsystems external sources such as smart grid and internal layers such as demand response layer can regularly generate events e.g. messages alarms changed values etc. and provide the events to integrated control layer or another layer configured to handle the particular event. For example demand response DR events e.g. a change in real time energy pricing may be provided to smart building manager as Open Automated Demand Response OpenADR messages a protocol developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories . The DR messages may be received by OpenADR adapter which may be a part of enterprise application layer shown in . The OpenADR adapter may be configured to convert the OpenADR message into a DR event configured to be understood e.g. parsed interpreted processed etc. by demand response layer . The DR event may be formatted and transmitted according to or via a service bus for the smart building manager .

Service bus adapter may be configured to trap or otherwise receive the DR event on the service bus and forward the DR event on to demand response layer . Service bus adapter may be configured to queue mediate or otherwise manage demand response messages for demand response layer . Once a DR event is received by demand response layer logic thereof can generate a control trigger in response to processing the DR event. The integrated control engine of integrated control layer is configured to parse the received control trigger to determine if a control strategy exists in control strategy database that corresponds to the received control trigger. If a control strategy exists integrated control engine executes the stored control strategy for the control trigger. In some cases the output of the integrated control engine will be an apply policy message for business rules engine to process. Business rules engine may process an apply policy message by looking up the policy in business rules database . A policy in business rules database may take the form of a set of action commands for sending to building subsystems . The set of action commands may include ordering or scripting for conducting the action commands at the correct timing ordering or with other particular parameters. When business rules engine processes the set of action commands therefore it can control the ordering scripting and other parameters of action commands transmitted to the building subsystems .

Action commands may be commands for relatively direct consumption by building subsystems commands for other applications to process or relatively abstract cross subsystem commands. Commands for relatively direct consumption by building subsystems can be passed through service bus adapter to service bus and to a subsystem adapter for providing to a building subsystem in a format particular to the building subsystem. Commands for other applications to process may include commands for a user interface application to request feedback from a user a command to generate a work order via a computerized maintenance management system CMMS application a command to generate a change in an ERP application or other application level commands.

More abstract cross subsystem commands may be passed to a semantic mediator which performs the task of translating those actions to the specific commands required by the various building subsystems . For example a policy might contain an abstract action to set lighting zone X to maximum light. The semantic mediator may translate this action to a first command such as set level to 100 for lighting object O in controller C and a second command of set lights to on in controller Z zone id no 3141593. In this example both lighting object O in controller C and zone id no 3141593 in controller Z may affect lighting in zone X. Controller C may be a dimming controller for accent lighting while controller Z may be a non dimming controller for the primary lighting in the room. The semantic mediator is configured to determine the controllers that relate to zone X using ontology database . Ontology database stores a representation or representations of relationships the ontology between building spaces and subsystem elements and subsystems elements and concepts of the integrated building supersystem. Using the ontology stored in ontology database the semantic mediator can also determine that controller C is dimming and requires a numerical percentage parameter while controller Z is not dimming and requires only an on or off command. Configuration tool can allow a user to build the ontology of ontology database by establishing relationships between subsystems building spaces input output points or other concepts objects of the building subsystems and the building space.

Events other than those received via OpenADR adapter demand response layer or any other specific event handing mechanism can be trapped by subsystem adapter a part of building integration subsystem layer and provided to a general event manager via service bus and a service bus adapter. By the time an event from a building subsystem is received by event manager it may have been converted into a unified event i.e. common event standardized event etc. by subsystem adapter and or other components of building subsystem integration layer such as semantic mediator . The event manager can utilize an event logic DB to lookup control triggers control trigger scripts or control trigger sequences based on received unified events. Event manager can provide control triggers to integrated control engine as described above with respect to demand response layer . As events are received they may be archived in event history by event manager . Similarly demand response layer can store DR events in DR history . One or both of event manager and demand response layer may be configured to wait until multi event conditions are met e.g. by processing data in history as new events are received . For example demand response layer may include logic that does not act to reduce energy loads until a series of two sequential energy price increases are received. In an exemplary embodiment event manager may be configured to receive time events e.g. from a calendaring system . Different time events can be associated with different triggers in event logic database .

In an exemplary embodiment the configuration tools can be used to build event conditions or trigger conditions in event logic or control strategy database . For example the configuration tools can provide the user with the ability to combine data e.g. from subsystems from event histories using a variety of conditional logic. In varying exemplary embodiments the conditional logic can range from simple logical operators between conditions e.g. AND OR XOR etc. to pseudo code constructs or complex programming language functions allowing for more complex interactions conditional statements loops etc. . The configuration tools can present user interfaces for building such conditional logic. The user interfaces may allow users to define policies and responses graphically. In some embodiments the user interfaces may allow a user to select a pre stored or pre constructed policy and adapt it or enable it for use with their system.

Referring still to in some embodiments integrated control layer generally and integrated control engine can operate as a service that can be used by higher level layers of smart building manager enterprise applications or subsystem logic whenever a policy or sequence of actions based on the occurrence of a condition is to be performed. In such embodiments control operations do not need to be reprogrammed applications or logic can rely on the integrated control layer to receive an event and to execute the related subsystem functions. For example demand response layer fault detection and diagnostics layer shown in enterprise integration and applications may all utilize a shared control strategy and integrated control engine in initiate response sequences to events.

Referring now to the fault detection and diagnostics FDD layer is shown in greater detail according to an exemplary embodiment. Fault detection and diagnostics FDD layer is configured to provide on going fault detection of building subsystems building subsystem devices and control algorithms of the integrated control layer. The FDD layer may receive its inputs from the integrated control layer directly from one or more building subsystems or devices or from the smart grid. The FDD layer may automatically diagnose and respond to detected faults. The responses to detected or diagnosed faults may include providing an alert message to a user a maintenance scheduling system or a control algorithm configured to attempt to repair the fault or to work around the fault. In other exemplary embodiments FDD layer is configured to provide fault events to integrated control layer as described with reference to and the integrated control layer of is configured to execute control strategies and policies in response to the received fault events. According to an exemplary embodiment the FDD layer or a policy executed by an integrated control engine or business rules engine may shut down systems or direct control activities around faulty devices or systems to reduce energy waste extend equipment life or assure proper control response. The FDD layer may be configured to use statistical analysis of near real time and or historical building subsystem data to rapidly identify faults in equipment operation.

As shown in the FDD layer is configured to store or access a variety of different system data stores or data points for live data . FDD layer may use some content of data stores to identify faults at the equipment level e.g. specific chiller specific AHU specific terminal unit etc. and other content to identify faults at component or subsystem levels. The FDD layer may be configured to output a specific identification of the faulty component or cause of the fault e.g. loose damper linkage using detailed subsystem inputs available at the building subsystem integration layer shown in previous Figures . Such specificity and determinations may be calculated by the FDD layer based on such subsystem inputs and for example statistical fault detection module . Statistical fault detection module can utilize pattern recognition methods pattern classification methods rule based classification methods outlier analysis statistical quality control charting techniques or the like to conduct its statistical analysis. In some embodiments statistical fault detection module more particularly is configured to calculate or update performance indices . Performance indices may be calculated based on exponentially weighted moving averages EWMAs to provide statistical analysis features which allow outlier and statistical process control SPC techniques to be used to identify faults. For example the FDD layer may be configured to use meter data outliers to detect when energy consumption becomes abnormal. Statistical fault detection module may also or alternatively be configured to analyze the meter data using statistical methods that provide for data clustering outlier analysis and or quality control determinations. The meter data may be received from for example a smart meter a utility or calculated based on the building use data available to the smart building manager.

Once a fault is detected by the FDD layer e.g. by statistical fault detection module the FDD layer may be configured to generate one or more alarms or events to prompt manual fault diagnostics or to initiate an automatic fault diagnostics activity via automated diagnostics module . Automatic fault diagnostics module may be configured to use meter data weather data model data e.g. performance models based on historical building equipment performance building subsystem data performance indices or other data available at the building subsystem integration layer to complete its fault diagnostics activities.

In an exemplary embodiment when a fault is detected the automated diagnostics module is configured to investigate the fault by initiating expanded data logging and error detection diagnostics activities relative to the inputs outputs and systems related to the fault. For example the automated diagnostics module may be configured to poll sensors associated with an air handling unit AHU e.g. temperature sensors for the space served by the AHU air flow sensors position sensors etc. on a frequent or more synchronized basis to better diagnose the source of a detected AHU fault.

Automated fault diagnostics module may further be configured to compute residuals differences between measured and expected values for analysis to determine the fault source. For example automated fault diagnostics module may be configured to implement processing circuits or methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 487 594 filed Jun. 18 2009 titled Systems and Methods for Fault Detection of Air Handling Units the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Automated fault diagnostics module can use a finite state machine and input from system sensors e.g. temperature sensors air mass sensors etc. to diagnose faults. State transition frequency e.g. between a heating state a free cooling state and a mechanical cooling state may also be used by the statistical fault detection module and or the automated diagnostics module to identify and diagnose unstable control issues. The FDD layer may also or alternatively be configured for rule based predictive detection and diagnostics e.g. to determine rule thresholds to provide for continuous monitoring and diagnostics of building equipment .

In addition to or as an alternative to an automated diagnostics process provided by automated diagnostics module FDD layer can drive a user through a manual diagnostic process using manual diagnostics module . One or both of automated diagnostics module and manual diagnostics module can store data regarding the fault and the diagnosis thereof for further assessment by manual and or automated fault assessment engine . Any manually driven process of assessment engine can utilize graphical or textual user interfaces displayed to a user to receive feedback or input from a user. In some embodiments assessment engine will provide a number of possible reasons for a fault to the user via a GUI. The user may select one of the faults for manual investigation or calculation. Similarly an automated process of assessment engine may be configured to select the most probable cause for a fault based on diagnostics provided by modules or . Once a cause is detected or estimated using assessment engine a work order can be generated by work order generation and dispatch service . Work order generation and dispatch service can transmit the work order to a service management system and or a work dispatch service for action.

Further data and processing results from modules or other data stored or modules of a fault detection and diagnostics layer can be provided to the enterprise integration layer shown in . Monitoring and reporting applications can then access the data or be pushed the data so that real time system health dashboards can be viewed and navigated by a user e.g. a building engineer . For example monitoring and reporting applications may include a web based monitoring application that includes several graphical user interface GUI elements e.g. widgets dashboard controls windows etc. for displaying key performance indicators KPI or other information to users of a GUI using FDD layer information or analyses. In addition the GUI elements may summarize relative energy use and intensity across different buildings real or modeled different campuses or the like. Other GUI elements or reports may be generated and shown based on available data that allow facility managers to assess performance across a group of buildings from one screen. The user interface or report or underlying data engine may be configured to aggregate and categorize faults by building building type equipment type fault type times of occurrence frequency of occurrence severity and the like. The GUI elements may include charts or histograms that allow the user to visually analyze the magnitude of occurrence of specific faults or equipment for a building time frame or other grouping. A time series pane of the GUI may allow users to diagnose a fault remotely by analyzing and comparing interval time series data trends and patterns for various input output points tracked logged by the FDD layer . The FDD layer may include one or more GUI servers or services e.g. a web service to support such applications. Further in some embodiments applications and GUI engines may be included outside of the FDD layer e.g. monitoring and reporting applications shown in web services shown in GUI engine shown in . The FDD layer may be configured to maintain detailed historical databases e.g. relational databases XML databases etc. of relevant data and includes computer code modules that continuously frequently or infrequently query aggregate transform search or otherwise process the data maintained in the detailed databases. The FDD layer may be configured to provide the results of any such processing to other databases tables XML files or other data structures for further querying calculation or access by for example external monitoring and reporting applications.

In an exemplary embodiment the automated diagnostics module automatically prioritizes detected faults. The prioritization may be conducted based on customer defined criteria. The prioritization may be used by the manual or automated fault assessment module to determine which faults to communicate to a human user via a dashboard or other GUI. Further the prioritization can be used by the work order dispatch service to determine which faults are worthy of immediate investigation or which faults should be investigated during regular servicing rather than a special work request. The FDD layer may be configured to determine the prioritization based on the expected financial impact of the fault. The fault assessment module may retrieve fault information and compare the fault information to historical information. Using the comparison the fault assessment module may determine an increased energy consumption and use pricing information from the smart grid to calculate the cost over time e.g. cost per day . Each fault in the system may be ranked according to cost or lost energy. The fault assessment module may be configured to generate a report for supporting operational decisions and capital requests. The report may include the cost of allowing faults to persist energy wasted due to the fault potential cost to fix the fault e.g. based on a service schedule or other overall metrics such as overall subsystem or building reliability e.g. compared to a benchmark . The fault assessment module may further be configured to conduct equipment hierarchy based suppression of faults e.g. suppressed relative to a user interface suppressed relative to further diagnostics etc. . For such suppression module may use the hierarchical information available at e.g. integrated control layer or building subsystem integration layer shown in . For example module may utilize building subsystem hierarchy information stored in ontology database to suppress lower level faults in favor of a higher level fault suppress faults for a particular temperature sensor and air handling unit in favor of a fault that communicates Inspect HVAC Components Serving Conference Room .

FDD layer may also receive inputs from lower level FDD processes. For example FDD layer may receive inputs from building subsystem supervisory controllers or field controllers having FDD features. In an exemplary embodiment FDD layer may receive FDD events process the received FDD events query the building subsystems for further information or otherwise use the FDD events in an overall FDD scheme e.g. prioritization and reporting . U.S. Pat. No. 6 223 544 titled INTEGRATED CONTROL AND FAULT DETECTION OF HVAC EQUIPMENT issued May 1 2001 incorporated herein by reference and U.S. Pub. No. 2009 0083583 titled FAULT DETECTION SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SELF OPTIMIZING HEATING VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING CONTROLS filed Nov. 25 2008 published Mar. 26 2009 incorporated herein by reference may be referred to as examples of FDD systems and methods that may be implemented by FDD layer and or lower level FDD processes for providing information to FDD layer .

In some exemplary embodiments the DR layer may include a control module configured to actively initiate control actions e.g. automatically changing setpoints which minimize energy costs based on one or more inputs representative of or based on demand e.g. price a curtailment signal a demand level etc. . The DR layer may further include or draw upon one or more DR policy definitions e.g. databases XML files etc. . The policy definitions may be edited or adjusted by a user e.g. via a graphical user interface so that the control actions initiated in response to demand inputs may be tailored for the user s application desired comfort level particular building equipment or based on other concerns. For example the DR policy definitions can specify which equipment may be turned on or off in response to particular demand inputs how long a system or piece of equipment should be turned off what setpoints can be changed what the allowable set point adjustment range is how long to hold a high demand setpoint before returning to a normally scheduled setpoint how close to approach capacity limits which equipment modes to utilize the energy transfer rates e.g. the maximum rate an alarm rate other rate boundary information etc. into and out of energy storage devices e.g. thermal storage tanks battery banks etc. and when to dispatch on site generation of energy e.g. via fuel cells a motor generator set etc. . One or more of the policies and control activities may be located within control strategy database or business rules database . Further as described above with reference to some of the DR responses to events may be processed and completed by integrated control layer with or without further inputs or processing by DR layer .

A plurality of market based DR inputs and reliability based DR inputs may be configured e.g. via the DR policy definitions or other system configuration mechanisms for use by the DR layer . The smart building manager may be configured e.g. self configured manually configured configured via DR policy definitions etc. to select deselect or differently weigh varying inputs in the DR layer s calculation or execution of control strategies based on the inputs. DR layer may automatically and or via the user configuration calculate outputs or control strategies based on a balance of minimizing energy cost and maximizing comfort. Such balance may be adjusted e.g. graphically via rule sliders etc. by users of the smart building manager via a configuration utility or administration GUI.

The DR layer may be configured to receive inputs from other layers e.g. the building subsystem integration layer the integrated control layer etc. . The inputs received from other layers may include environmental or sensor inputs such as temperature carbon dioxide levels relative humidity levels air quality sensor outputs occupancy sensor outputs room schedules and the like. The inputs may also include inputs such as electrical use e.g. expressed in kWh thermal load measurements pricing information projected pricing smoothed pricing curtailment signals from utilities and the like from inside the system from the smart grid or from other remote sources.

Some embodiments of the DR layer may utilize industry standard open protocols or emerging National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST standards to receive real time pricing RTP or curtailment signals from utilities or power retailers. In other embodiments proprietary protocols or other standards may be utilized. As mentioned above in some exemplary embodiments the DR layer is configured to use the OpenADR protocol to receive curtailment signals or RTP data from utilities other independent system operators ISOs or other smart grid sources. The DR layer or another layer e.g. the enterprise integration layer that serves the DR layer may be configured to use one or more security schemes or standards such as the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards OASIS Web Service Security Standards to provide for secure communications to from the DR layer and the smart grid e.g. a utility company s data communications network . If the utility does not use a standard protocol e.g. the OpenADR protocol the DR layer the enterprise integration layer or the building subsystem integration layer may be configured to translate the utility s protocol into a format for use by the utility. The DR layer may be configured to bi directionally communicate with the smart grid or energy providers and purchasers e.g. a utility an energy retailer a group of utilities an energy broker etc. to exchange price information demand information curtailable load calculations e.g. the amount of load calculated by the DR layer to be able to be shed without exceeding parameters defined by the system or user load profile forecasts and the like. DR layer or an enterprise application in communication with the DR layer may be configured to continuously monitor pricing data provided by utilities ISOs across the nation to parse the useful information from the monitored data and to display the useful information to a user to or send the information to other systems or layers e.g. integrated control layer .

The DR layer may be configured to include one or more adjustable control algorithms in addition to or as an alternative from allowing the user creation of DR profiles. For example one or more control algorithms may be automatically adjusted by the DR layer using dynamic programming or model predictive control modules. In one embodiment business rules engine is configured to respond to a DR event by adjusting a control algorithm or selecting a different control algorithm to use e.g. for a lighting system for an HVAC system for a combination of multiple building subsystems etc. .

The smart building manager e.g. using the demand response layer can be configured to automatically or with the help of a user manage energy spend. The smart building manager with input from the user or operating using pre configured business rules shown in may be configured to accept time of use pricing signals or information from a smart grid e.g. an energy provider a smart meter etc. and using its knowledge of historical building system data control algorithms calendar information and or weather information received from a remote source may be configured to conduct automatic cost forecasting. The smart building manager e.g. the demand response layer may automatically or with user approval take specific load shedding actions or control algorithm changes in response to different cost forecasts.

The smart building manager may also be configured to monitor and control energy storage systems e.g. thermal electrical etc. and distributed generation systems e.g. a solar array for the building etc. . The smart building manager or DR layer may also be configured to model utility rates to make decisions for the system. All of the aforementioned processing activities or inputs may be used by the smart building manager and more particularly a demand response layer thereof to limit cap profit from or otherwise manage the building or campus s energy spend. For example using time of use pricing information for an upcoming hour that indicates an unusually high price per kilowatt hour the system may use its control of a plurality of building systems to limit cost without too drastically impacting occupant comfort. To make such a decision and to conduct such activity the smart building manager may use data such as a relatively high load forecast for a building and information that energy storage levels or distributed energy levels are low. The smart building manager may accordingly adjust or select a control strategy to reduce ventilation levels provided to unoccupied areas reduce server load raise a cooling setpoint throughout the building reserve stored power for use during the expensive period of time dim lights in occupied areas turn off lights in unoccupied areas and the like.

The smart building manager may provide yet other services to improve building or grid performance. For example the smart building manager may provide for expanded user driven load control allowing a building manager to shed loads at a high level of system device granularity . The smart building manager may also monitor and control power switching equipment to route power to from the most efficient sources or destinations. The smart building manager may communicate to the power switching equipment within the building or campus to conduct smart voltage regulation. For example in the event of a brownout the smart building manager may prioritize branches of a building s internal power grid tightly regulating and ensuring voltage to high priority equipment e.g. communications equipment data center equipment cooling equipment for a clean room or chemical factory etc. while allowing voltage to lower priority equipment to dip or be cut off by the smart grid e.g. the power provider . The smart building manager or the DR layer may plan these activities or proactively begin load shedding based on grid services capacity forecasting conducted by a source on the smart grid or by a local algorithm e.g. an algorithm of the demand response layer . The smart building manager or the DR layer may further include control logic for purchasing energy selling energy or otherwise participating in a real time or near real time energy market or auction. For example if energy is predicted to be expensive during a time when the DR layer determines it can shed extra load or perhaps even enter a net positive energy state using energy generated by solar arrays or other energy sources of the building or campus the DR layer may offer units of energy during that period for sale back to the smart grid e.g. directly to the utility to another purchaser in exchange for carbon credits etc. .

In some exemplary embodiments the DR layer may also be configured to support a Grid Aware plug in hybrid electric vehicle PHEV electric vehicle charging system instead of or in addition to having the charging system in the vehicles be grid aware. For example in buildings that have vehicle charging stations e.g. terminals in a parking lot for charging an electric or hybrid vehicle the DR layer can decide when to charge the vehicles e.g. when to enable the charging stations when to switch a relay providing power to the charging stations etc. based upon time real time pricing RTP information from the smart grid or other pricing demand or curtailment information from the smart grid. In other embodiments each vehicle owner could set a policy that is communicated to the charging station and back to the DR layer via wired or wireless communications that the DR layer could be instructed to follow. The policy information could be provided to the DR layer via an enterprise application a vehicle information system or a personal portal e.g. a web site vehicle owner s are able to access to input for example at what price they would like to enable charging . The DR layer could then activate the PHEV charging station based upon that policy unless a curtailment event is expected or occurs or unless the DR layer otherwise determines that charging should not occur e.g. decides that electrical storage should be conducted instead to help with upcoming anticipated peak demand . When such a decision is made the DR layer may pre charge the vehicle or suspend charge to the vehicle e.g. via a data command to the charging station . Vehicle charging may be restricted or turned off by the smart building manager during periods of high energy use or expensive energy. Further during such periods the smart building manager or the DR layer may be configured to cause energy to be drawn from plugged in connected vehicles to supplement or to provide back up power to grid energy.

Using the real time or near real time detailed information regarding energy use in the building the smart building manager may maintain a greenhouse gas inventory forecast renewable energy use surpluses deficits and generation and facilitate emission allocation emission trading and the like. Due to the detailed and real time or near real time nature of such calculations the smart building manager may include or be coupled to a micro transaction emission trading platform.

The DR layer may further be configured to facilitate the storage of on site electrical or thermal storage and to controllably shift electrical loads from peak to off peak times using the stored electrical or thermal storage. The DR layer may be configured to significantly shed loads during peak hours if for example high price or contracted curtailment signals are received using the stored electrical or thermal storage and without significantly affecting building operation or comfort. The integrated control layer may be configured to use a building pre cooling algorithm in the night or morning and rely on calculated thermal storage characteristics for the building in order to reduce peak demand for cooling. Further the integrated control layer may be configured to use inputs such as utility rates type of cooling equipment occupancy schedule building construction climate conditions upcoming weather events and the like to make control decisions e.g. the extent to which to pre cool etc. .

The AM V layer may further be configured to verify that control strategies commanded by for example the integrated control layer or the DR layer are working properly. Further the AM V layer may be configured to verify that a building has fulfilled curtailment contract obligations. The AM V layer may further be configured as an independent verification source for the energy supply company utility . One concern of the utility is that a conventional smart meter may be compromised to report less energy or energy consumed at the wrong time . The AM V layer can be used to audit smart meter data or other data used by the utility by measuring energy consumption directly from the building subsystems or knowledge of building subsystem usage and comparing the measurement or knowledge to the metered consumption data. If there is a discrepancy the AM V layer may be configured to report the discrepancy directly to the utility. Because the AM V layer may be continuously operational and automated e.g. not based on a monthly or quarterly calculation the AM V layer may be configured to provide verification of impact e.g. of demand signals on a granular scale e.g. hourly daily weekly etc. . For example the AM V layer may be configured to support the validation of very short curtailment contracts e.g. drop kW h over 20 minutes starting at 2 00 pm acted upon by the DR layer . The DR layer may track meter data to create a subhourly baseline model against which to measure load reductions. The model may be based on average load during a period of hours prior to the curtailment event during the five prior uncontrolled days or as specified by other contract requirements from a utility or curtailment service provider e.g. broker . The calculations made by the AM V layer may be based on building system energy models and may be driven by a combination of stipulated and measured input parameters to estimate calculate apportion and or plan for load reductions resulting from the DR control activities.

The AM V layer may yet further be configured to calculate energy savings and peak demand reductions in accordance with standards protocols or best practices for enterprise accounting and reporting on greenhouse gas GHG emissions. An application may access data provided or calculated by the AM V layer to provide for web based graphical user interfaces or reports. The data underlying the GUIs or reports may be checked by the AM V layer according to for example the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Standard and the GHG Protocol for Project Accounting. The AM V layer preferably consolidates data from all the potential sources of GHG emissions at a building or campus and calculates carbon credits energy savings in dollars or any other currency or unit of measure makes adjustments to the calculations or outputs based on any numbers of standards or methods and creates detailed accountings or inventories of GHG emissions or emission reductions for each building. Such calculations and outputs may allow the AM V layer to communicate with electronic trading platforms contract partners or other third parties in real time or near real time to facilitate for example carbon offset trading and the like.

The AM V Layer may be further configured to become a smart electric meter a or substitute for conventional electric meters. One reason the adoption rate of the Smart Electric Grid has conventionally been low is that the entire stock of installed electric meters needs to be replaced so that the meters will support Real Time Pricing RTP of energy and other data communications features. The AM V layer can collect interval based electric meter data and store the data within the system. The AM V layer can also communicate with the utility to retrieve or otherwise receive Real Time Pricing RTP signals or other pricing information and associate the prices with the meter data. The utility can query this information from the smart building manager e.g. the AM V layer the DR layer at the end of a billing period and charge the customer using a RTP tariff or another mechanism. In this manner the AM V layer can be used as a Smart Electric Meter .

When the AM V layer is used in conjunction with the DR layer building subsystem integration layer and enterprise integration layer the smart building manager can be configured as an energy service portal ESP . As an ESP the smart building manager may communicably or functionally connect the smart grid e.g. energy supply company utility ISO broker etc. network to the metering and energy management devices in a building e.g. devices built into appliances such as dishwashers or other smart appliances . In other words the smart building manager may be configured to route messages to and from other data aware e.g. Real Time Pricing RTP aware curtailment signal aware pricing aware etc. devices and the energy supply company. In this configuration building subsystems that are not RTP aware will be managed by the DR layer while devices that are RTP aware can get signals directly from the utility. For example if a vehicle e.g. PHEV is programmed to charge only when the price of electricity is below 0.1 kWh the PHEV can query the utility through the smart building manager and charge independently from the DR layer .

In an exemplary embodiment the AM V layer described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 302 854 filed Feb. 9 2010 can be used as AM V layer or a part thereof.

The enterprise integration layer shown in or is configured to serve clients or local applications with information and services to support a variety of enterprise level applications. The enterprise integration layer may be configured to communicate in real time or near real time with the smart grid and or energy providers and purchasers . More particularly in some embodiments the enterprise integration layer may communicate with smart meters automated meter interfaces with utilities carbon emission tracking and accounting systems energy reporting systems a building occupant interface and traditional enterprise productivity applications e.g. maintenance management systems financial systems workplace and supply chain management systems etc. . The enterprise integration layer may be configured to use protocols and methods as described above with respect to other layers or otherwise.

As indicated above the enterprise integration layer shown in may be configured to exchange information with a building occupant interface application. In other exemplary embodiments the enterprise integration layer serves the building occupant interface application to clients connecting to the enterprise integration layer web services and or GUI engine . In yet other embodiments web services may utilize GUI engine for graphics rendering resources and enterprise integration layer for data relating to the building occupant interface in order to provide the building occupant interface to client applications.

Exemplary graphical user interfaces GUIs for the building occupant interface i.e. tenant energy portal are shown in . In an exemplary embodiment the tenant energy management portal is a web based user interface that allows a tenant of a participating building to view their energy usage information apart from or in comparison to other tenants in the building. The tenant energy management portal may be configured to utilize services of integrated control layer and or building subsystem integration layer shown in to relate particular portions of the building portions of building subsystems or particular systems and devices of the building to particular tenants. For example a relationship stored in ontology database shown in may include a serves relationship. Those devices that serve a particular building space are related i.e. in a relational database e.g. Lighting Controller Y serves Floor B . A further relationship may relate each of the building spaces to particular tenants e.g. Floor B belongs to Tenant A . Accordingly historical energy usage information relating to particular building spaces or devices can be queried per building tenant and aggregated averaged or otherwise computed using services of integrated control layer and or building subsystem integration layer . These aggregations or computations may be reported to a user via GUIs A D e.g. graphics constructed by GUI engine and or web services . For example in some of the GUIs of the tenant energy portal is configured to provide graphs or tabulations of current energy consumption in kilowatts. is an example of building history data that may be viewed for a portion of a week using the Building History tab near the top of the GUI. The tenant energy portal may further be configured to provide associated metrics derived from other data available to e.g. integrated control or building subsystem integration layer . For example metrics such as kW ft 2 kW planned occupants and kW counted occupants may be calculated and shown to the user via the GUIs. As illustrated in historical consumption for the tenant viewing the portal may be compared to other tenants in the building. Such a view may allow a tenant to identify possible new energy saving policies e.g. for automated enforcement via integrated control layer or for human communication please remember to turn lights off as you leave your office . As illustrated in building space information such as area occupants and man hours associated with tenants may be shown in addition to energy usage information. The tenant is then able to view consumption relative to other tenants of similar size or use. Other building space metadata may also be shown via the GUIs. For example tenant type e.g. law firm banking accounting call center data center standard industry code SIC types etc. and tenant location e.g. top of the building lower of the building may be shown to the user. Users can use a configuration tool or a menu structure to build custom reports tailored to their individual interests. In other embodiments logic of the tenant energy portal may be configured to select default views for consumption by a tenant. For example if the tenant is a law firm the GUI may by default provide the user with a comparison of its energy consumption in comparison to other law firms in the building.

In one exemplary embodiment tenant energy portal is configured to provide a data sharing mechanism e.g. a forum a blog a social networking type component etc. . Access to such a mechanism may be obtained by clicking on for example blog tab . Using such a mechanism the tenant can share comment on and discuss energy information with other tenants in the building. By allowing tenants to view manipulate and share their energy data microeconomic trends may begin to take place driving down energy usage for the tenants and for the building as a whole. Further the social networking aspect of the data sharing mechanism may encourage participation of and between all tenants in the building. To further encourage such use the tenant energy management portal may be configured to restrict access to tenant comparisons or detailed tenant comparisons unless a tenant is willing to enable sharing of their data. Via a blog or forum feature tenants can ask questions about their energy usage bill statements or energy efficiency measures. The building owner e.g. a building manager for the owner may monitor the tenant blogs for common issues or to assist with energy reduction initiatives that the tenant may want to implement. In some embodiments the tenant energy portal can provide privacy security confidentiality anonymity or other features for each tenant. Accordingly each tenant may be provided with security settings.

In an exemplary embodiment access to and supervisory control of the tenant energy portal is controlled by a building owner configuration tool. The building owner using the building owner configuration tool can define and provide user accounts to his or her tenants. The tenants can then log in to the system and begin using the tenant energy portal . In an exemplary embodiment after logging into the tenant energy management portal the tenant is shown a personalized main page . This main page may include the tenant s real time energy consumption in a current electrical consumption pane . As shown in current kW person kW sq.ft. and kW man hr may also be displayed. The main page may include a tab e.g. tab or tab that allows the tenant to customize the main page with various modules e.g. current electrical consumption module historical electrical consumption module . Modules may be rearranged on a screen resized reconfigured changed for different modules or otherwise adjusted by a user. In one example of an alternative module to those shown in illustrates a ranking style comparison of tenant specific energy consumption relative to all other tenants in the building for the week. The energy comparison of may be triggered by a user clicking on the Energy Comparison tab. Drop down boxes allow a user to change the tenant groupings and time frames for the comparison. In an exemplary embodiment a view created by a user may be saved once updated e.g. via save button or printed e.g. via print button . Once a view is saved it can be selected as a module set as the default view for a tenant or otherwise recalled or reused. Historical usage details shown in allow the tenant to view its past energy usage. This view supports custom date ranges and can display data in either tabular or graphical format e.g. a graphical format for historical consumption is shown in module . The data can be exported e.g. to a flat file to a structured database saved as a graphic saved as a screen shot of a tenant view etc. so that the tenant may perform custom analysis of their energy data e.g. using a spreadsheet program . In an exemplary embodiment the tenant can view the following metrics per defined period usage in kWh or another unit utility bill for the period in USD or another unit cost per square foot or other units the average number of occupants during the period the kWh per occupant during the period and the kWh per square foot. In an exemplary embodiment tenant energy portal may be configured to rank tenants by energy efficiency and provide each tenant with its rank as well as one or more tips for improving energy efficiency. Such rankings and comparisons are intended to provide a race to energy efficiency among building tenants. In large buildings such races may have very significant impacts on energy efficiency and energy savings.

Referring again to the smart building manager may be configured to provide drivers for BACnet LON N2 Modbus OPC OBIX MIG SMTP XML Web services and various other wireless communications protocols including Zigbee. These drivers may be implemented within or used by the service bus adapters or subsystem adapters. The service bus for the smart building manager may be configured to communicate using any number of smart grid communications standards. Such standards may be utilized for intra manager communication as well as communication with a smart grid component e.g. utility company smart meter etc. . For example the smart building manager may be configured to use the ANSI C12.22 C12.19 protocol for some internal communications e.g. DR events as well as for communications with the smart grid. The service bus adapters and subsystem adapters convert received messages into a normalized messaging format for use on the service bus. In an exemplary embodiment the service bus is flexible making use of IT centric message queuing technologies e.g. Open AMQ MSMQ and WebSphere MQ to assure reliability security scalability and performance. Service bus adapters enable layers and applications to communicate among one another and or to the various in building or external systems e.g. via subsystem adapters . Stored communications rules may be used by the service bus adapters subsystem adapters or other components of the system to catch or correct communications failures. Communications and action failure rules may also be configured for use by the action layers of the system. For example the DR layer can check for whether an action requested or commanded by the DR layer has completed. If not the DR layer can take a different action or a corrective action e.g. turn off an alternate load adjust additional setpoints trigger a focused FDD activity etc. to ensure that DR needs are met. The smart building manager can also determine if someone has provided a DR override command to the system and take corrective action if available. If corrective action is unavailable an appropriate message or warning may be sent to a DR partner e.g. a utility co. an energy purchaser via the smart grid etc. .

The smart building manager may reside on e.g. be connected to an IP Ethernet network utilizing standard network infrastructure protocols and applications e.g. DNS DHCP SNTP SNMP Active Directory etc. and can also be secured using IT security best practices for those standard network infrastructure protocols and applications. For example in some embodiments the smart building manager may include or be installed behind infrastructure software or hardware such as firewalls or switches. Further configurations in the smart building manager can be used by the system to adjust the level of security of the smart building manager . For example the smart building manager or particular components thereof can be configured to allow its middle layers or other components to communicate only with each other to communicate with a LAN WAN or Internet to communicate with select devices having a building service or to restrict communications with any of the above mentioned layers components data sources networks or devices. The smart building manager may be configured to support a tiered network architecture approach to communications which may provide for some measure of security. Outward facing components are placed in a less secure tier of the network to act as a point of entry to from the smart building manager . These outward facing components are minimized e.g. a web server receives and handles all requests from client applications which limits the number of ways the system can be accessed and provides an indirect communications route between external devices applications and networks and the internal layers or modules of the smart building manager . For example behind the outward facing first tier may lie a more secure tier of the network that requires for authentication and authorization to occur at the first tier before functions of the more secure tier are accessed. The smart building manager may be configured to include firewalls between such tiers or to define such tiers to protect databases or core components of the system from direct unauthorized access from outside networks.

In addition to including or implementing infrastructure type security measures as the type disclosed above the smart building manager may be configured to include a communications security module configured to provide network message security between the smart building manager and an outside device or application. For example if SOAP messaging over HTTP is used for communication at the enterprise integration layer the SOAP messages may be concatenated to include an RC2 encrypted header containing authentication credentials. The authentication credentials may be checked by the receiving device e.g. the smart building manager the end application or device etc. . In some embodiments the encrypted header may also contain information e.g. bits configured to identify whether the message was tampered with during transmission has been spoofed or is being replayed by an attacker. If a message does not conform to an expected format or if any part of the authentication fails the smart building manager may be configured to reject the message and any other unauthorized commands to the system. In some embodiments that use HTTP messages between the application and the smart building manager the smart building manager may be configured to provide SSL for message content security encryption and or Forms authentication for message authentication.

The smart building manager may yet further include an access security module that requires any application to be authenticated with user credentials prior to logging into the system. The access security module may be configured to complete a secure authentication challenge accomplished via a public or private key exchange e.g. RSA keys of a session key e.g. an RC2 key after a login with user credentials. The session key is used to encrypt the user credentials for the authentication challenge. After the authentication challenge the session key is used to encrypt the security header of the messages. Once authenticated user actions within the system are restricted by action based authorizations and can be limited. For example a user may be able to command and control HVAC points but may not be able to command and control Fire and Security points. Furthermore actions of a user within the smart building manager are written to memory via an audit trail engine providing a record of the actions that were taken. The database component of the smart building manager e.g. for storing device information DR profiles configuration data pricing information or other data mentioned herein or otherwise can be accessible via an SQL server that is a part of the building management server or located remotely from the smart building manager . For example the database server component of the smart building manager may be physically separated from other smart building manager components and located in a more secure tier of the network e.g. behind another firewall . The smart building manager may use SQL authentication for secure access to one or more of the aforementioned databases. Furthermore in an exemplary embodiment the smart building manager can be configured to support the use of non default instances of SQL and a non default TCP port for SQL. The operating system of the smart building manager may be a Windows based operating system.

Each smart building manager may provide its own security and is not reliant on a central server to provide the security. Further the same robustness of the smart building manager that provides the ability to incorporate new building subsystem communications standards modules drivers and the like also allows it to incorporate new and changing security standards e.g. for each module at a higher level etc. .

The smart building manager shown in the Figures may be configured to support multi campus or multi building energy management services. Each of a plurality of campuses can include a smart building manager configured to manage the building IT and energy resources of each campus. In such an example the building subsystems shown e.g in may be a collection of building subsystems for multiple buildings in a campus. The smart building manager may be configured to bi directionally communicate with on site power generation systems e.g. distributed power sources related services solar arrays fuel cell arrays diesel generators combined heat and power CHP systems etc. plug in hybrid electric vehicle PHEV systems and energy storage systems e.g. stationary energy storage thermal energy storage etc. . Data inputs from such sources may be used by the demand and response layer of the smart building manager to make demand or response decisions and to provide other ancillary services to a connected smart grid e.g. utility smart meter connected to a utility etc. in real time or near real time. For example the smart building manager may communicate with smart meters associated with an energy utility and directly or indirectly with independent systems operators ISOs which may be regional power providers. Using these communications and its inputs from devices of the campus the smart building manager e.g. the demand response layer is configured to engage in peak shaving load shedding or load balancing programs which provide financial incentives for reducing power draw during certain days or times of day. The demand response layer or other control algorithms of the smart building manager e.g. control algorithms of the integrated control layer may be configured to use weather forecast information to make setpoint or load shedding decisions e.g. so that comfort of buildings in the campus is not compromised . The smart building manager may be configured to use energy pricing information campus energy use information or other information to optimize business transactions e.g. the purchase of energy from the smart grid the sale of energy to the smart grid the purchase or sale of carbon credits with energy providers and purchasers etc. . The smart building manager is configured to use the decisions and processing of the demand response layer to affect control algorithms of the integrated control layer.

While is shown as a tightly coupled smart building manager in some embodiments the processing circuit of including the layers modules thereof may be distributed to different servers that together form the smart building manager having the control features described herein. In embodiments where the smart building manager is controlling an entire campus or set of campuses one or more smart building managers may be layered to effect hierarchical control activities. For example an enterprise level smart building manager may provide overall DR strategy decisions to a plurality of lower level smart building managers that process the strategy decisions e.g. using the framework shown in to effect change at an individual campus or building. By way of further example the integrated control layer and the building system integration layer may be replicated for each building and stored within lower level smart building servers while a single enterprise level smart building manager may provide a single higher level layer such the DR layer. Such a DR layer can execute a campus wide DR strategy by passing appropriate DR events to the separate lower level smart building mangers having integrated control layers and building system integration layers. Higher level servers may provide software interfaces APIs to the one or more lower level servers so that the one or more lower level servers can request information from the higher level server provide commands to the higher level server or otherwise communicate with the layers or data of the higher level server. The reverse is also true APIs or other software interfaces of the lower level servers may be exposed for consumption by the higher level server. The software interfaces may be web services interfaces relational database connections or otherwise.
