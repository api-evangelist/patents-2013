Breech loaded weapons that use bag ammunition require a seal at the breech to prevent propellant gases from passing to the rear into the threads or other parts of the breech mechanism. The traditional method of sealing a breech loaded cannon uses a rubber donut shaped ring between forward and rear split rings. The forward and rear split rings and the rubber donut shaped ring are squeezed between a threaded breech block and the sealing cone of the cannon tube. The forward and rear split rings are able to move annularly about the axis of the spindle when the block is opened or closed. The traditional sealing approach was invented by DeBange in 1872. The DeBange obturator includes five independent parts. The obturator assembly must be inspected and cleaned daily or whenever residue or damage results in a high closing torqure.

A problem with the DeBange sealing method is when the spindle is removed for daily inspection and cleaning of the obturator seal the five parts of the obturator seal assembly tend to fall apart. Handling the loose parts is akin to a juggling act. The parts do not readily reassemble correctly. The parts may also fall into hard to reach areas where they are difficult to retrieve. In military operations time is often critical. In addition aligning and reassembling the parts of the obturator seal assembly typically requires two people.

The problem of loose parts was eliminated with the design of a one piece obturator assembly known as the Crossley obturator and described in U.S. Pat. No. 2 444 633. The Crossley invention introduced new problems. The Crossley assembly uses front and rear rings that are riveted to the rubber donut shaped ring. Each front and rear ring is comprised of three split segments or arcs. Unlike the DeBange split rings the Crossley rings three segments or arcs do not perfectly conform to the sealing cone diameters on the cannon tube. Moreover the arcs are fixed to the rubber donut shaped ring using rivets for each arc or segment. Consequently the areas of the donut shaped ring where the segmented portions of the rings intersect and flex and the areas of the donut shaped ring that retain the rivets are repeatedly subjected to extreme burn wear. In addition the rivets wear on and tear at the rubber donut shaped ring because the breech block tends to twist the obturator pad which is held by friction to the cannon tube as the breech block is opened and closed. The cyclic wear of the Crossley obturator assembly is also high due to the unequal heat expansion of vastly different materials that are riveted together. If any component of the Crossley obturator assembly is damaged the complete assembly is discarded.

There is a long felt but unsolved need for an obturator assembly with the advantages of the Crossley and Debange obturator seal assembly designs but without their disadvantages.

One aspect of the invention is an obturator assembly for sealing the breech of a breech loaded cannon. The obturator assembly includes a central longitudinal axis and a generally annular seal centered on the central longitudinal axis. The generally annular seal includes a front portion and a rear portion. The front portion includes a leading angled surface. The rear portion includes a trailing angled surface and a flat surface contiguous with and radially inward of the trailing angled surface.

At least three holes are equally spaced circumferentially in the leading angled surface of the front portion. At least three holes are equally spaced circumferentially in the flat surface of the rear portion. The three holes in the flat surface are equally spaced circumferentially between the three holes in the leading angled surface. Magnets are disposed in each of the at least three holes in the leading angled surface and in each of the at least three holes in the flat surface.

A front split ring is centered on the central longitudinal axis in abutment to the leading angled surface. The front split ring is held in place by the magnets in the at least three holes in the leading angled surface. A rear split ring is centered on the central longitudinal axis and in abutment to the trailing angled surface. A rear inner ring is centered on the central longitudinal axis and disposed on the rear portion of the seal. An annular disc is centered on the central longitudinal axis and in abutment to rear surfaces of the rear split ring and the rear inner ring. The annular disc is held in place by the magnets in the at least three holes in the flat surface.

Magnetic force from the magnets in the leading angled surface and the magnets in the flat surface may be of a magnitude to permit rotation of the front split ring the rear split ring the rear inner ring and the annular disc with respect to the seal when the breech of the cannon is opened and closed.

The at least three holes in the leading angled surface of the front portion may have respective central longitudinal axes that are normal to the leading angled surface. The at least three holes in the flat surface of the rear portion may have respective central longitudinal axes that are normal to the flat surface.

The magnets in the flat surface may be oriented in the same pole direction and the magnets in the leading angle surface may be oriented in the same pole direction. The magnets may comprise high temperature super magnets. Each magnet may be covered with an elastomeric coating. Each magnet may have a cylindrical shape.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel obturator seal assembly for a breech loaded cannon enables the components of the assembly to be held together as a single unit during disassembly. In contrast to the known Crossley assembly the novel obturator seal assembly does not restrict the movement and or conformation of the components of the assembly during operation of the cannon. In addition as the breech block of the cannon is opened and or closed the components of the novel obturator seal assembly can move freely about the spindle both annularly and independently. The novel obturator seal assembly provides the advantages and benefits of unrestricted free movement and assembly cohesion.

Seal is elastomeric and may be made of for example neoprene. Seal has a front portion and a rear portion . Front portion includes a leading angled surface . As shown in leading angled surface is angled with respect to axis C. Rear portion of seal includes a trailing angled surface and a flat surface . As shown in trailing angled surface is angled with respect to axis C. Flat surface is contiguous with and radially inward of trailing angled surface .

A plurality of holes equally spaced circumferentially is formed in leading angled surface of front portion . Preferably there are at least three holes . As shown in the central longitudinal axis A of each hole is normal to leading angled surface . A plurality of holes is also formed in flat surface of rear portion . Holes are equally spaced circumferentially and preferably are equally spaced circumferentially with respect to holes in leading angled surface such that all holes are equally spaced circumferentially. As shown in the central longitudinal axis B of each hole is normal to flat surface .

Magnets are disposed in each of the holes . Magnets may be high temperature super magnets. High temperature super magnets are strong permanent magnets made from alloys of rare earth elements for example neodymium magnets and samarium cobalt magnets. Magnets may be cylindrical in shape. The poles of magnets in holes shown as N North and S South in the Figs. are oriented in the same direction. Similarly the poles of magnets in holes are oriented in the same direction.

Front split ring includes a surface that mates with and engages leading angled surface of seal . Front split ring is held in abutment to angled surface by the magnetic force of magnets disposed in holes . However the magnetic force is not so great as to prevent front split ring from rotating with respect to angled surface when the breech of cannon is opened or closed.

Rear split ring includes a surface that mates with and engages trailing angled surface of seal . Rear inner ring includes a surface that mates with and engages rear portion of annular seal . An annular disc abuts the rear surfaces of rear split ring and rear inner ring . Annular disc and consequently rear split ring and rear inner ring are held in place by the magnetic force of magnets in holes . However the magnetic force is not so great as to prevent rear split ring rear inner ring and annular disc from rotating with respect to seal when the breech of cannon is opened or closed.

Holes may be formed in annular seal by drilling. Holes are of a size to enable the elastomer of seal to grip magnets . As a result no adhesive may be needed to position magnets in holes . Magnets may be hand pressed into holes . Holes are of a depth to enable magnets to be fully embedded in seal . An elastomeric coating may be placed over magnets to prevent wear on magnets as rings and turn or rotate.

Front split ring rear split ring rear inner ring and annular disc may be made of for example steel. In one embodiment rear inner ring and annular disc may be a single integral piece to hinder transverse displacement of annular disc .

In addition to the benefits previously noted the manufacturing method of assembly is much simpler compared to the Crossley manufacturing method. Existing DeBange seals presently in use or in stock may be used as seals in the inventive assembly .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
