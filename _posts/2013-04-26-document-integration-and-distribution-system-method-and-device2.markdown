Document management is typically an integral part of running a business particularly when a business has remotely located business locations. Many businesses receive hundreds or thousands of documents every day from outside sources at various locations. These documents typically need to be filed and or forwarded correctly for proper operation of a business. Received documents are typically routed to the appropriate person department or file location via hand delivery email or other delivery services to the appropriate offices or file rooms. The number of received documents often requires substantial efforts and costs in determining the appropriate location for each document and delivering each document to its appropriate location.

Many companies use business software systems such as customer relationship management CRM systems to manage communications and transactions with their customers. When employees send or receive documents the known business software systems do not provide a relatively simple and easy to use method for storing the documents in association with the applicable customer account. The known software systems do not provide a relatively simple and easy to use method for combining multiple documents for forwarding to a customer or vendor. Also the known software systems do not provide a relatively simple and easy to use method for setting tasks to contact the recipient at a future date to confirm receipt of the document and answer any questions. Consequently employees can encounter a loss in work flow efficiency a decrease in productivity and a decrease in customer service quality.

Therefore there is a need to overcome or otherwise lessen the effects of these disadvantages and shortcomings.

The present disclosure provides a new and innovative method system and apparatus for scanning and importing documents. Specifically the disclosed system provides a device for scanning documents and importing and forwarding scanned documents based on document identifiers. Documents are received and reviewed for entry into the document management system. An identifier is associated with each document based on the level of available information about the document. Then an identifier is assigned to each document and documents and identifiers are scanned. Documents are then imported into the document management system or forwarded to a recipient for additional review. Separator identifiers may be used to increase efficiency. Further certain users may have access to reporting functions to access information about the document management system. The disclosed system provides an efficient and improved system for remotely managing documents.

Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in and will be apparent from the following Brief Description of the Figures and Detailed Description.

The interface circuit may be implemented using any suitable interface standard such as an Ethernet interface and or a Universal Serial Bus USB interface. One or more input devices may be connected to the interface circuit for entering data and commands into the main unit . For example the input device may be a scanner photocopier barcode reader keyboard mouse touch screen track pad track ball isopoint and or a voice recognition system. In an example described in more detail below an input device may be used to scan documents and document identifiers for importing the documents into a document management system . Data scanned from an input device may be stored on any directory accessible to the host device .

One or more displays or printers speakers and or other output devices may also be connected to the main unit via the interface circuit . The display may be a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display LCD or any other type of display. The display generates visual displays of data generated during operation of the host device . The visual displays may include prompts for human input run time statistics calculated values data etc.

One or more storage devices may also be connected to the main unit via the interface circuit . For example a hard drive CD drive DVD drive and or other storage devices may be connected to the main unit . The storage devices may store any type of data used by the host device . For example the storage device may store scanned documents scanned document identifiers and archived document identifiers.

The host device may also exchange data with a network device a remote database client and or a document management system using a connection to network . For example a remotely located host device may connect to a network device database client and or document management system via a remote desktop protocol connection. Storage devices may be exposed to the network devices database client and or document management system via the network . The network connection may be any suitable network connection such as an Ethernet connection digital subscriber line DSL telephone line coaxial cable etc. Access to a host device may be controlled by appropriate security software or security measures. An individual user s access can be defined by the host device and limited to certain data and or actions. For example certain users may be allowed transmit scanned document data to a document management system which may operate with network device and or database client . Additionally certain users may also have the ability to view reports regarding document management system and associated data flow. Accordingly users of the system may be required to register with a host device . The data exchanged between the host device and the network device database client and or document management system may include document data i.e. scanned document identifiers and documents from an input device forms and associated data i.e. a web page for data entry and inputs from an input device screen files i.e. image data for display at the database client trapped events at the database client and raw data including data stored on the storage device and manipulable at the network device database client and or document management system .

The example document scanning and importing process begins by receiving a batch of documents to enter into the document management system block . For example a business receives a daily shipment of documents from the postal service. Documents may be received from multiple sources to form a document batch including delivery service facsimile telegram etc. For example the employee may prepare some documents receive some documents from other employees and receive documents from outside the company. An employee may receive a document in an electronic format that is not supported by the document management system which may be printed as a hard copy with an output device . A batch may be broken into several smaller batches and in some cases a batch may include only one document.

Once a batch of documents has been received review a document in the batch block . For example an employee of an insurance company may look at the first document of the batch checking for a client policy claim number or a department that should review the document. The employee may not have much information about documents that are not generated by the employee.

After reviewing a document determine if full information is known about the document block . For example in a document management system where files are organized by client then policy then claim if each of these variables is known an employee may know exactly which file the document should be stored in. However if only a client and policy is known the document cannot simply be imported into the document management system because additional information is required to properly file the document.

If full information is known about the document associate a full information identifier with the document block . For example an employee selects a client policy claim number barcode. An employee may select a barcode or other identifier in a variety of ways. For example a barcode may be selected from binder stack folder or other location in an employee s office. If an employee commonly receives documents for a certain client policy claim the employee may keep barcode identifiers readily available for quick and easy access. Alternatively if a document is received that is uncommon for an employee a barcode identifier may be pulled up from a storage device and printed with an output device . Accordingly an employee is not required to keep hundreds or thousands of identifiers accessible for use with host device . Further the act of associating an identifier does not necessarily require any physical act. For example as described in more detail below an employee may associate an identifier by determining the client policy claim number of a document without actually obtaining the client policy claim number physical identifier for that document.

An identifier may include any optical indicator such as a conventional 1D barcode a 2d data matrix barcode an alphanumeric string recognizable via optical character recognition punch card etc. Preferably the identifier may be scanned in the same manner as the document. For example the identifier is a barcode on a printed piece of paper that is the same size as the document. It should be appreciated that identifiers may come in a variety of forms. Identifiers may be reusable and or disposable. For example a high volume identifier may be printed on heavy stock and reused many times or may be printed on normal paper and disposed of after use.

If full information is not known about the document determine the appropriate recipient to forward the document to block . For example a manager John Doe should receive the document. A recipient may be any person i.e. employee manager contractor department i.e. accounting marketing any physical location i.e. Chicago office electronic storage i.e. database junk mail filtering server project folder etc. As will be described in more detail below a recipient will receive the document and may have additional information such as a client policy claim number. A recipient may also be a folder for documents that are reviewed but provide no information to determine a recipient. Documents of this unknown nature may be made available in a daily email for a certain group of employees where an employee in the group may be able to provide information.

Once the appropriate recipient has been determined associate a partial information identifier with the document block . For example an employee selects department barcode. Preferably all possible recipients would have an identifier that may be associated with a document. The identifier may be preset or may be generated once the identifier is required. For example a new employee may not have a preset barcode until a document must be sent to that new employee at which time it is automatically generated.

Once a full information identifier or a partial information identifier has been associated with a document assign an identifier to the document block . For example an employee attaches an identifier to the front of a document. The identifier attached will typically be the same identifier which was associated with the document. However an identifier that is assigned to a document may be different from the associated identifier. For example as described in more detail below a separator identifier may be assigned to a document. Preferably a standard method of assigning identifiers to documents is used. For example an identifier barcode may always be attached as the first page of a document to be scanned by an input device .

Once an identifier has been assigned to a document determine if there are more documents in the batch block . If there are additional documents review each additional document according to the above described document scanning and importing process .

If there are no more documents in the batch scan the document batch with the assigned identifiers block . For example an employee may scan a document batch with a photocopier. The document batch may include three documents each with an assigned identifier i.e. full information barcode A document A partial information barcode B document B full information barcode C document C .

Once the document batch has been scanned import documents with full information identifiers assigned to them block . For example documents are imported to the appropriate client policy claim file location within the document management system . The document management system may process the documents in a variety of ways for importation. Preferably the scanned batch of documents will be imported into the document management system with the identifiers stripped out so the documents will be imported in their original clean format. It will be appreciated that document data may be manipulated and compressed in a variety of ways. Further the history of each document may be tracked by the document management system the host device network devices and or the database client .

Once documents with full information identifiers assigned to them are imported forward documents with partial information identifiers assigned to them block . For example documents are forwarded to the appropriate recipient. The documents may be forwarded in a variety of ways. For example the documents may be converted into a standard email message with attachments to the recipients email inbox. Accordingly the recipient may import the document into management system save the document locally recycle the document and or forward the document to a more appropriate recipient. Further the history for each document including all messages may be tracked by the document management system the host device network devices and or the database client . Additionally certain users may have access to reporting capabilities. For example an inbox administrator may view reports on the inbox statistics of each recipient. The reports may include information such as how many documents are in each recipient s inbox the average amount of time it takes each recipient to take action on items within their inbox and how long documents have remained in a recipient s inbox. Accordingly the inbox administrator may ensure efficient use of the example document scanning and importing process by ensuring that documents that are associated with partial information identifiers are handled by the recipients with appropriate dispatch.

The example identifier assignment process begins by determining if the current document is the first document in the batch block . If the document is the first document in the batch assign the associated identifier to the document block . For example an employee may attach a printed barcode page to the beginning of the first document in the batch.

If the document is not the first document in the batch determine if the current document s associated identifier is the same as the previous document s associated identifier block . If the identifier associated with the present document is not the same as the identifier associated with the previous document then assign the associated identifier to the document block . For example an employee may attach a printed barcode page to the beginning of the third document in the batch.

If the identifier associated with the present document is the same as the identifier associated with the previous document then assign a separator identifier to the document block . For example an employee may attach a separator barcode page to the beginning of the fifth document in the batch. A separator identifier indicates that a document should be imported or forwarded in the same manner as the previous document. It should be appreciated that an employee may associate a client policy claim number barcode with a document but not take any action on that association and may assign a separator barcode instead. Such a technique of not for example printing an associated barcode may save considerable time. It should be appreciated that the example document scanning and importing process may be optimized by making appropriate use of separator identifiers.

If five documents are to be forwarded to a recipient using one partial information identifier and four separator identifiers may save time. For example an employee may have an easily accessible stock of separator identifiers whereas each partial information identifier may have to be printed via an output device . Similarly if ten documents are to be imported for the client policy claim number into the document management system using one full information identifier and nine separator identifiers may save time. For example an employee may have a stack of separator identifiers sitting next to the scanner and may need to print each full information identifier using an output device .

It should be appreciated that a person reviewing a document batch such as an employee may organize the document batch to make the scanning and importing process more efficient. For example if a document batch is received with several documents for each of two recipients with the documents in alternating fashion the documents could be rearranged so that the recipients documents are segregated from each other. Accordingly separator identifiers could be used to save time. However for large batches of documents it may be inefficient to attempt to rearrange the documents to use separator identifiers.
