Prostacyclin PGI2 is a lipid molecule derived from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway. It is a potent vasodilator antiproliferative anti thrombotic and antiplatelet agent that mediates its effects as an agonist of a G protein coupled receptor PGI2 receptor e.g. human PGI2 receptor GenBank Accession No. NP000951 and alleles thereof . It is known that the binding of PGI2 or other such agonist to the PGI2 receptor leads to coupling with the Gs protein and increases intracellular cAMP levels. See e.g. Zhang et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006 454 80 88. 

Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH is a life threatening disease characterized by a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Right heart failure occurs if left untreated. Prostacyclin which has vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary vasculature has been found to be low in patients with PAH compared with normal controls. Exogenous administration of prostacyclin or an analog of prostacyclin i.e. an agonist of the PGI2 receptor has become an important strategy in the treatment of PAH. See e.g. Tuder et al. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 1999 159 1925 1932 Humbert et al. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004 43 13S 24S Rosenzweig Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs 2006 11 609 619 McLaughlin et al. Circulation 2006 114 1417 1431 Rosenkranz Clin. Res. Cardiol. 2007 96 527 541 Driscoll et al. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2008 9 65 81. 

Trepostinil and iloprost are FDA approved analogs of prostacyclin which like prostacyclin are not orally active. Beraprost is an orally active analog of prostacyclin approved for the treatment of PAH in Japan but it has failed registration for the treatment of PAH in Europe and in the US. Of the three FDA approved drugs prostacyclin is the best studied in PAH patients. The approximate annual cost of treating PAH with these drugs is 25 000 to 200 000 depending on the dose. At present many experts consider intravenous prostacyclin to be the most reliable agent for managing the sickest PAH patients. Due to the short half life of prostacyclin intravenous treatment is complicated by the need for a continuous infusion. Patients are at risk for potentially fatal rebound pulmonary hypertension if the infusion is abruptly disrupted as well as significant risk of catheter related complications including sepsis. See e.g. Rosenzweig Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs 2006 11 609 619 Naeije et al. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2007 8 2247 2265 Strauss et al. Clin. Chest. Med. 2007 28 127 142 Driscoll et al. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2008 9 65 81. 

There is considerable interest in developing prostacyclin analogs i.e. agonists of the PGI2 receptor for use in the treatment of other diseases such as atherothrombosis. Developing stable orally active analogs of prostacyclin i.e. stable orally active agonists of the PGI2 receptor is a rate limiting step in achieving this goal see e.g. Arehart et al. Curr. Med. Chem. 2007 14 2161 2169 Arehart et al. Circ. Res. 2008 102 8 986 93 as well as in the improved management of PAH.

Tawara et al. have demonstrated that long term inhibition of Rho kinase an effector of the small GTPase Rho ameliorates monocrotaline induced PAH in rats and hypoxia induced PAH in mice. The same group also reported that prostacyclin and its oral analog beraprost sodium BPS may lack direct inhibitory effect on Rho kinase in vitro suggesting that combination therapy with a Rho kinase inhibitor and BPS is effective for the treatment of PAH. Thus male Sprague Dawley rats were given a s.c. injection of monocrotaline 60 mg kg and maintained with or without the treatment with a Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil 30 mg kg day BPS 200 g kg day or a combination of both drugs for three weeks. The combination therapy when compared with each monotherapy showed significantly more improvement in PAH right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary medial thickness without any adverse effects. See Tawara et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology 2007 50 2 195 200. 

The PGI2 receptor agonists disclosed herein alone or in combination with a Rho kinase inhibitor are useful in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH and symptoms thereof.

The enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase TPH has two known isoforms TPH1 which is expressed in the periphery and TPH2 which is expressed primarily in the brain. Mice genetically deficient for the TPH1 gene knockout mice have been reported. In one case the mice reportedly expressed normal amounts of serotonin in classical serotonergic brain regions but largely lacked serotonin in the periphery. Walther D. J. et al. Science 299 76 2003 . In another the knockout mice exhibited abnormal cardiac activity which was attributed to a lack of peripheral serotonin. Cote F. et al. PNAS 100 23 13525 13530 2003 .

Recently TPH knockout mice were studied in a hypoxia induced pulmonary arterial hypertension model. Morecroft I. et al. Hypertension 49 232 236 2007 . The results of those studies suggest that TPH1 and peripheral serotonin play an essential role in the development of hypoxia induced elevations in pulmonary pressures and hypoxia induced pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Antiplatelet agents antiplatelets are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example in coronary artery disease they are used to help prevent myocardial infarction or stroke in patients who are at risk of developing obstructive blood clots e.g. coronary thrombosis .

In a myocardial infarction MI or heart attack the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen rich blood as a result of a blockage in the coronary blood vessels. If taken while an attack is in progress or immediately afterward preferably within 30 min antiplatelets can reduce the damage to the heart.

A transient ischemic attack TIA or mini stroke is a brief interruption of oxygen flow to the brain due to decreased blood flow through arteries usually due to an obstructing blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in preventing TIAs.

Angina is a temporary and often recurring chest pain pressure or discomfort caused by inadequate oxygen rich blood flow ischemia to some parts of the heart. In patients with angina antiplatelet therapy can reduce the effects of angina and the risk of myocardial infarction.

Stroke is an event in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen rich blood usually due to blockage of a cerebral blood vessel by a blood clot. In high risk patients taking antiplatelets regularly has been found to prevent the formation of blood clots that cause first or second strokes.

Angioplasty is a catheter based technique used to open arteries obstructed by a blood clot. Whether or not stenting is performed immediately after this procedure to keep the artery open antiplatelets can reduce the risk of forming additional blood clots following the procedure s .

Coronary bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to a blocked coronary artery rerouting blood around the blockage and through the newly attached vessel. After the procedure antiplatelets can reduce the risk of secondary blood clots.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained irregular heart rhythm arrhythmia . Atrial fibrillation affects about two million Americans every year. In atrial fibrillation the atria the heart s upper chambers rapidly fire electrical signals that cause them to quiver rather than contract normally. The result is an abnormally fast and highly irregular heartbeat. When given after an episode of atrial fibrillation antiplatelets can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the brain embolism .

There is evidence that a PGI2 receptor agonist will inhibit platelet aggregation and thus be a potential treatment as an antiplatelet therapy see e.g. Moncada et al. Lancet 1977 1 18 20 . It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the PGI2 receptor in mice leads to an increased propensity towards thrombosis Murata et al. Nature 1997 388 678 682 .

PGI2 receptor agonists can be used to treat for example claudication or peripheral artery disease as well as cardiovascular complications arterial thrombosis atherosclerosis vasoconstriction caused by serotonin ischemia reperfusion injury and restenosis of arteries following angioplasty or stent placement. See e.g. Fetalvero et al. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2007 82 109 118 Arehart et al. Curr. Med. Chem. 2007 14 2161 2169 Davi et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007 357 2482 2494 Fetalvero et al. Am. J.

PGI2 receptor agonists can also be used alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy for example tissue type plasminogen activator t PA to provide cardioprotection following MI or postischemic myocardial dysfunction or protection from ischemic injury during percutaneous coronary intervention and the like including complications resulting therefrom. PGI2 receptor agonists can also be used in antiplatelet therapies in combination with for example alpha tocopherol vitamin E echistatin a disintegrin or in states of hypercoagulability heparin. See e.g. Chan. J. Nutr. 1998 128 1593 1596 Mardla et al. Platelets 2004 15 319 324 Bernabei et al. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 1995 59 149 153 Gainza et al. J. Nephrol. 2006 19 648 655.

A further aspect of the present invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds as described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Some embodiments pertain to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Formulations may be prepared by any suitable method typically by uniformly mixing the active compound s with liquids or finely divided solid carriers or both in the required proportions and then if necessary forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape.

Conventional excipients such as binding agents fillers acceptable wetting agents tabletting lubricants and disintegrants may be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration may be in the form of solutions emulsions aqueous or oily suspensions and syrups. Alternatively the oral preparations may be in the form of dry powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents non aqueous vehicles including edible oils preservatives and flavorings and colorants may be added to the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms may be prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and sealing an appropriate vial or ampule. These are just a few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms.

A compound of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques well known to those in the art. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers outside those mentioned herein are known in the art for example see Remington 20Edition 2000 Lippincott Williams Wilkins Editors Gennaro et al. 

While it is possible that for use in the prophylaxis or treatment a compound of the invention may in an alternative use be administered as a raw or pure chemical it is preferable however to present the compound or active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation or composition further comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral rectal nasal topical including buccal and sub lingual vaginal or parenteral including intramuscular subcutaneous and intravenous administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation insufflation or by a transdermal patch. Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with minimal degradation of the drug. Typically transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer a single pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdermal patch based upon the needs of the artisan.

The compounds of the invention together with a conventional adjuvant carrier or diluent may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages thereof and in such form may be employed as solids such as tablets or filled capsules or liquids such as solutions suspensions emulsions elixirs gels or capsules filled with the same all for oral use in the form of suppositories for rectal administration or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral including subcutaneous use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions with or without additional active compounds or principles and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.

For oral administration the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of for example a tablet capsule suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are capsules tablets powders granules or a suspension with conventional additives such as lactose mannitol corn starch or potato starch with binders such as crystalline cellulose cellulose derivatives acacia corn starch or gelatins with disintegrators such as corn starch potato starch or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein for example saline dextrose or water may be used as a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Compounds of the present invention or a solvate hydrate or physiologically functional derivative thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions specifically as PGI2 receptor modulators. By the term active ingredient is defined in the context of a pharmaceutical composition and is intended to mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary pharmacological effect as opposed to an inactive ingredient which would generally be recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit.

The dose when using the compounds of the present invention can vary within wide limits and as is customary and is known to the physician it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends for example on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated on the condition of the patient on the compound employed or on whether an acute or chronic disease state is treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention. Representative doses of the present invention include but not limited to about 0.001 mg to about 5000 mg about 0.001 mg to about 2500 mg about 0.001 mg to about 1000 mg 0.001 mg to about 500 mg 0.001 mg to about 250 mg about 0.001 mg to 100 mg about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg and about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg. Multiple doses may be administered during the day especially when relatively large amounts are deemed to be needed for example 2 3 or 4 doses. Depending on the individual and as deemed appropriate from the patient s physician or caregiver it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the doses described herein.

The amount of active ingredient or an active salt or derivative thereof required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. In general one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data obtained in a model system typically an animal model to another such as a human. In some circumstances these extrapolations may merely be based on the weight of the animal model in comparison to another such as a mammal preferably a human however more often these extrapolations are not simply based on weights but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include the type age weight sex diet and medical condition of the patient the severity of the disease the route of administration pharmacological considerations such as the activity efficacy pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed whether a drug delivery system is utilized on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention and as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety factors as cited above. Thus the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize that dosage and dosage regimen outside these typical ranges can be tested and where appropriate may be used in the methods of this invention.

The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals for example as two three four or more sub doses per day. The sub dose itself may be further divided e.g. into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided especially when relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate into several for example 2 3 or 4 part administrations. If appropriate depending on individual behavior it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose indicated.

The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise as the active component either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate or hydrate of a compound of the invention.

For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention the selection of a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be either solid liquid or a mixture of both. Solid form preparations include powders tablets pills capsules cachets suppositories and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents flavoring agents solubilizers lubricants suspending agents binders preservatives tablet disintegrating agents or an encapsulating material.

In powders the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.

In tablets the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desire shape and size. The powders and tablets may contain varying percentage amounts of the active compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may contain from 0.5 to about 90 percent of the active compound however an artisan would know when amounts outside of this range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are magnesium carbonate magnesium stearate talc sugar lactose pectin dextrin starch gelatin tragacanth methylcellulose sodium carboxymethylcellulose a low melting wax cocoa butter and the like. The term preparation is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without carriers is surrounded by a carrier which is thus in association with it. Similarly cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets powders capsules pills cachets and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.

For preparing suppositories a low melting wax such as an admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds allowed to cool and thereby to solidify.

Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries tampons creams gels pastes foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.

Liquid form preparations include solutions suspensions and emulsions for example water or water propylene glycol solutions. For example parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.

In the case of a spray this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.

Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant. If the compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation this can be carried out for example using a spray a nebulizer a pump nebulizer an inhalation apparatus a metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds of the present invention as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well known to the person skilled in the art. For their preparation for example solutions or dispersions of the compounds of the present invention in water water alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be employed using customary additives for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability solubilizers dispersants and others and if appropriate customary propellants for example include carbon dioxide CFCs such as dichlorodifluoromethane trichlorofluoromethane or dichlorotetrafluoroethane and the like. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.

Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition for combination therapy comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein together with at least one known pharmaceutical agent as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

It is noted that when the PGI2 receptor modulators are utilized as active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition these are not intended for use only in humans but in other non human mammals as well. Indeed recent advances in the area of animal health care mandate that consideration be given for the use of active agents such as PGI2 receptor modulators for the treatment of an PGI2 associated disease or disorder in companionship animals e.g. cats dogs etc. and in livestock animals e.g. cows chickens fish etc. Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with understanding the utility of such compounds in such settings.

It is understood that when the phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates and hydrates is used in referring to a particular formula herein it is intended to embrace solvates and or hydrates of compounds of the particular formula pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula as well as solvates and or hydrates of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula.

The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise as the active component either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or as a solvate or hydrate thereof. Moreover various hydrates and solvates of the compounds of the invention and their salts will find use as intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Typical procedures for making and identifying suitable hydrates and solvates outside those mentioned herein are well known to those in the art see for example pages 202 209 of K. J. Guillory Generation of Polymorphs Hydrates Solvates and Amorphous Solids in ed. Harry G. Brittan Vol. 95 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1999 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Another object of the present invention relates to radio labeled compounds of the present invention that would be useful not only in radio imaging but also in assays both in vitro and in vivo for localizing and quantitating the PGI2 receptor in tissue samples including human and for identifying PGI2 receptor ligands by inhibition binding of a radio labeled compound. It is a further object of this invention to develop novel PGI2 receptor assays of which comprise such radio labeled compounds.

The present invention embraces isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention. Isotopically or radio labeled compounds are those which are identical to compounds disclosed herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature. Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to H also written as D for deuterium H also written as T for tritium C C C N N O O O F S Cl Br Br Br Br I I I and I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio labeled compound. For example for in vitro PGI2 receptor labeling and competition assays compounds that incorporate H C Br I I or S will generally be most useful. For radio imaging applications C F I I I I Br Br or Br will generally be most useful.

It is understood that a radio labeled or labeled compound is a compound of Formula Ia Ic Ie Ig or Ii that has incorporated at least one radionuclide in some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of H C I S and Br.

Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. In some embodiments the radionuclide H and or C isotopes are useful in these studies. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Drawings and Examples infra by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent. Other synthetic methods that are useful are discussed infra. Moreover it should be understood that all of the atoms represented in the compounds of the invention can be either the most commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or the scarcer radio isotope or nonradioactive isotope.

Synthetic methods for incorporating radio isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to compounds of the invention and are well known in the art. These synthetic methods for example incorporating activity levels of tritium into target molecules are as follows 

A. Catalytic Reduction with Tritium Gas This procedure normally yields high specific activity products and requires halogenated or unsaturated precursors.

B. Reduction with Sodium Borohydride H This procedure is rather inexpensive and requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes ketones lactones esters and the like.

C. Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride H This procedure offers products at almost theoretical specific activities. It also requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes ketones lactones esters and the like.

D. Tritium Gas Exposure Labeling This procedure involves exposing precursors containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst.

E. N Methylation using Methyl Iodide H This procedure is usually employed to prepare O methyl or N methyl H products by treating appropriate precursors with high specific activity methyl iodide H . This method in general allows for higher specific activity such as for example about 70 90 Ci mmol.

A. Sandmeyer and like reactions This procedure transforms an aryl amine or a heteroaryl amine into a diazonium salt such as a diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt and subsequently to I labeled compound using NaI. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu G D. and co workers in 2002 67 943 948.

B. Ortho Iodination of phenols This procedure allows for the incorporation of I at the ortho position of a phenol as reported by Collier T. L. and co workers in 1999 42 S264 S266.

C. Aryl and heteroaryl bromide exchange with I This method is generally a two step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or heteroaryl bromide to the corresponding tri alkyltin intermediate using for example a Pd catalyzed reaction i.e. Pd PhP or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium in the presence of a tri alkyltinhalide or hexaalkylditin e.g. CH SnSn CH . A representative procedure was reported by Le Bas M. D. and co workers in 2001 44 S280 S282.

A radiolabeled PGI2 receptor compound of Formula Ia can be used in a screening assay to identify evaluate compounds. In general terms a newly synthesized or identified compound i.e. test compound can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the radio labeled compound of Formula Ia to the PGI2 receptor. Accordingly the ability of a test compound to compete with the radio labeled compound of Formula Ia for the binding to the PGI2 receptor directly correlates to its binding affinity.

The labeled compounds of the present invention bind to the PGI2 receptor. In one embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 500 M in another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 100 M in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 10 M in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 1 M and in still yet another embodiment the labeled inhibitor has an ICless than about 0.1 M.

Compounds were screened for agonists of the human prostacyclin PGI2 receptor using the HTRF assay for direct cAMP measurement Gabriel et al. ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies 1 291 303 2003 and recombinant CHO K1 cells stably transfected with human prostacyclin receptor. CHO K1 cells were obtained from ATCC Manassas Va. Catalog CCL 61 . An agonist of the prostacyclin receptor was detected in HTRF assay for direct cAMP measurement as a compound which increased cAMP concentration. HTRF assay also was used to determine ECvalues for prostacyclin receptor agonists.

The HTRF assay kit was purchased from Cisbio US Inc. Bedford Mass. Catalog 62AM4PEC . The HTRF assay supported by the kit is a competitive immunoassay between endogenous cAMP produced by the CHO K1 cells and tracer cAMP labeled with the dye d2. The tracer binding is visualized by a monoclonal anti cAMP antibody labeled with Cryptate. The specific signal i.e. fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET is inversely proportional to the concentration of unlabeled cAMP in the standard or sample.

The fluorescence ratio 665 nm 620 nm of the standards 0.17 to 712 nM cAMP included in the assay was calculated and used to generate a cAMP standard curve according to the kit manufacturer s instructions. The fluorescence ratio of the samples test compound or compound buffer was calculated and used to deduce respective cAMP concentrations by reference to the cAMP standard curve.

The HTRF assay was carried out using a two step protocol essentially according to the kit manufacturer s instructions in 20 L total volume per well in 384 well plate format ProxiPlates PerkinElmer Fremont Calif. catalog 6008280 . To each of the experimental wells was transferred 3000 recombinant CHO K1 cells in 5 L assay buffer phosphate buffered saline containing calcium chloride and magnesium chloride Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. catalog 14040 supplemented with IBMX 100 M and rolipram 10 M phosphodiesterase inhibitors Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. catalog 15879 and catalog R6520 respectively and 0.1 bovine serum albumin BSA fraction V Sigma Aldrich catalog A3059 followed by test compound in 5 L assay buffer or 5 L assay buffer. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. To each well was then added 5 L cAMP d2 conjugate in lysis buffer and 5 L Cryptate conjugate in lysis buffer according to the kit manufacturer s instructions. The plate was then further incubated at room temperature for 1 h after which the assay plate was read.

The HTRF readout was accomplished using a PHERAstar BMG LABTECH Inc. Durham N.C. or EnVision PerkinElmer Fremont Calif. microplate reader.

Certain compounds of the present invention and their corresponding activity values are shown in TABLE B.

Certain other compounds of the invention had activity values ranging from about 1.3 nM to about 5 M in this assay.

Blood collected from healthy human volunteers in aqueous trisodium citrate solution was centrifuged at 150 g for 15 min and the upper layer was recovered to obtain platelet rich plasma PRP . The residual blood was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected as platelet poor plasma PPP . Platelet concentration in the PRP was determined using the Z series Beckman Coulter particle counter Beckman Fullerton Calif. and adjusted to 250 000 platelets L using PPP. 480 L of PRP was pre incubated at 37 C. and stirred at 1200 rpm with 10 L aqueous test compound solution for 1 min prior to induction of aggregation by the addition of 10 L of aqueous adenosine diphosphate ADP solution to adjust the final ADP concentration in the PRP to 1 10M. The maximal amplitude of aggregation response within 3 min was determined and measured in triplicate using the Chronolog model 490 aggregometer Chrono log Corp. Havertown Pa. . Percent inhibition of aggregation was calculated from the maximum decrease in optical density of the control addition of water in place of the test compound solution sample and of the samples containing test compound. The test compound was added to adjust the final concentration to the range 10to 10M and ICvalues were determined by inhibition percentage of aggregation at each concentration. The results are shown in Table C.

Certain other compounds of the invention had activity values ranging from about 10.3 nM to about 810 nM in this assay.

It is apparent that the compounds of the present invention markedly inhibit platelet aggregation in human PRP.

Male Wistar rats 100 150 g at start of study Charles River Laboratories Wilmington Mass. were housed two per cage and maintained in a humidity 40 60 and temperature 68 72 F. controlled facility on a 12 hr 12 hr light dark cycle lights on at 6 30 am with free access to food Harlan Teklad Orange Calif. Rodent Diet 8604 and water. Rats were allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing.

The rat monocrotaline MCT model is a standard and well accepted model of pulmonary arterial hypertension. MCT induces acute pulmonary endothelial damage associated with pulmonary vascular inflammation. Subsequently pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferate occluding small pulmonary vessels and leading to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension including right ventricular hypertrophy. See e.g. Schermuly et al. Circ. Res. 2004 94 1101 1108. 

Rats were randomly given a single subcutaneous injection of either 60 mg kg MCT Sigma St. Louis Mo. or 0.9 saline sham and assigned to receive oral administration of 20 hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin vehicle or test compound 30 mg kg . 10 11 rats were used per treatment group. 24 h following MCT administration test compound or vehicle was administered by oral gavage twice a day for 21 consecutive days. Heart chamber weights were measured on Day 22. Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital 50 mg kg the chest cavity was opened and the heart was excised. The right ventricle was dissected free from the septum and left ventricle and both parts were weighed. The ratio of right ventricular RV weight to left ventricle plus septum LV S weight this ratio is indicated as RV LV S in was calculated as an index of the hypertrophic response to the induced pulmonary arterial hypertension and as such as an index of a test compounds therapeutic efficacy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

It is apparent from inspection of that oral administration of Compounds 14 and 31 inhibited the hypertrophic response to the induced pulmonary arterial hypertension and as such evidenced therapeutic efficacy for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
