title: Intelligent routing of communications to an international number in a messaging service
abstract: Intelligent routing of communication(s) is provided to international number(s) in a messaging service. To route a communication that includes an international number, format of the communication is established. A text-only communication is delivered through a messaging service transport protocol (MSTP) suitable for text. A media-based communication intended for a plurality of recipients, e.g., a group message, is ungrouped, the international number is identified, and a new message is generated for a group of recipients that excludes a recipient associated with the international number. The new message is delivered through a MSTP suitable for media, whereas an exception handling procedure is conducted for the international number. In addition, to route the communication that includes an international number, network interoperability of predetermined MSTP can be assessed. The communication is delivered through the predetermined MSTP if it is interoperable. Conversely, the communication is routed as a media-based group message.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 634 201 filed on Dec. 9 2009 and entitled INTELLIGENT ROUTING OF COMMUNICATIONS TO AN INTERNATIONAL NUMBER IN A MESSAGING SERVICE. The entirety of the above noted application is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates generally to communication networks and more specifically to intelligent routing of media based and text based communications in messaging service s .

Mature messaging service transport protocols such as the Short Message Service SMS protocol display nearly ubiquitous interoperability amongst various telecommunication marketplaces including foreign or global marketplaces. Besides technology maturity the SMS protocol is not only largely employed for instant messaging IM of text content amongst subscribers but it is also heavily exploited as a signaling mechanism for exchange of control data amongst various network components which further promotes pervasive interoperability. In contrast messaging service transport protocols such as the Multimedia Messaging Service MMS protocol which are based on more recent communication standards particularly for telecommunication have rather limited interoperability especially amongst local or domestic and global marketplaces. As mobile communications expand globally because of at least pursuit of market share development by network operators and increased subscriber mobility such disparity in interoperability amongst marketplaces can be detrimental to advanced messaging services that exploit or are planned to exploit advanced messaging service transport protocols that enable rich multimedia intensive messaging services. Accordingly routing of communication s in an advanced messaging service with inadequate interoperability amongst marketplaces at either local or global scale may result in diminished perceived quality of service from subscribers with the ensuing risk of subscriber attrition or underdeveloped revenue for such advanced messaging service offerings.

One or more embodiments provide intelligent routing of media based or text based communications that are part of messaging service s . For a communication within the messaging service s or messaging service MS communication which includes an international number as part of a set of addresses of intended recipients of the MS communication at least one of a content based mechanism or an interoperability based mechanism is exploited to route the MS communication. In the content based mechanism a format of the MS communication is established. If the MS communication is a text only message then the MS communication is delivered through a messaging service transport protocol dedicated to text delivery such as SMS protocol or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP . When the text only message is intended for a plurality of recipients e.g. the MS communication is a group message the MS communication is ungrouped prior to delivery. In case the MS communication is a media based message intended for a plurality of recipients the MS communication is ungrouped the international number is identified and a new message is generated and directed to a group of recipients that excludes a recipient associated with the international number. The new message is delivered through a messaging service transport protocol for media content such as MMS or Session Initiation Protocol SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE whereas an exception handling procedure is conducted for the international number.

In the interoperability based mechanism for network operator s associated with the international number interoperability of a predetermined messaging service transport protocol is assessed. The assessment can be based at least on accessed interoperability data available to a network operator that administers the messaging service s . If such protocol is interoperable the communication is delivered through the messaging service transport protocol for media content otherwise the communication that includes the international number is processed in substantially the same fashion as in the content based mechanism.

As described in greater detail below one or more embodiment of the subject disclosure enable intelligent routing of communication s to international number s in a messaging service. To route a communication that includes an international number format of the communication is established. A text only communication is delivered through a messaging service transport protocol MSTP suitable for text. A media based communication intended for a plurality of recipients e.g. a group message is ungrouped the international number is identified and a new message is generated for a group of recipients that excludes a recipient associated with the international number. The new message is delivered through a MSTP suitable for media whereas an exception handling procedure is conducted for the international number. In addition to route the communication that includes an international number network interoperability of predetermined MSTP can be assessed. The communication is delivered through the predetermined MSTP if it is interoperable. Conversely the communication is routed as a media based group message.

With reference to the drawings is a block diagram of an example system that enables intelligent routing of a messaging service communication in accordance with aspects described herein. The subject example system includes a messaging client component also termed herein and annexed drawings messaging client that receives a messaging service MS communication comprising a set of addresses with K a natural number greater or equal than unity and content which can include at least one of text only content or multimedia content. In an aspect MS communication can be generated through a device or customer premises equipment CPE which can be mobile or non mobile and includes messaging client component . Each address with 1 2 . . . K can identify a device mobile or otherwise associated with a recipient of MS communication . In an aspect for K 1 MS communication is a group message and device s associated with respective recipient s of MS communication can render presence information related to the set of recipients that receives the MS communication in such device s the presence information can be rendered through visual or aural indicia. In addition each address can be at least one of an email address an IP address a server name an integrated circuit card identification ICCID serial number or a mobile subscriber integrated services digital network MSISDN a mobile identification number MIN or a telephone number in accordance with E.164 plan North American Numbering Plan NANP other numbering plan s or dialing plan s . One or more addresses in the set of addresses can include an international destination address or international destination.

In an aspect messaging client receives MS communication via router component which can be configured to deliver a group message in accordance with a predetermined messaging service transport protocol also referred to as predetermined transport protocol. Such predetermined transport protocol can be one of various messaging protocols that enable delivery of visual or aural indicia For example MMS protocol Instant Messaging and Presence Service IMPS protocol SIMPLE Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP SMTP or the like. Router component also can deliver non group message s intended for a single recipient in such scenario router component can be configured to deliver the non group message e.g. K 1 through one of various messaging service transport protocols or transport protocols such as SMS protocol MMS protocol SIMPLE XMPP IMPS protocol SMTP or the like. For an MS communication or message received within a messaging service router component can determine if the communication is a non group message and deliver the communication in accordance with a provisioned transport protocol for non group messages.

In an aspect of the subject disclosure to deliver a received message e.g. MS communication to a messaging server e.g. router component utilizes logic based in part on address es e.g. of intended recipient s in the received message. In one or more scenarios as described hereinafter router component can deliver a processed version of the incoming message either the received message or the processed version thereof is represented as message in . Router component can deliver at least one of the received message or the processed version thereof through a wireless link or wired link in accordance with one or more transport protocols as illustrated with MMS protocol and SMS protocol in .

The logic to deliver the received message is retained in logic store within memory and includes a set of rules for identifying an international destination in a received message and processing the received message that includes the international destination. Logic retained in logic store can be supplied by a network management component not shown at a time a device or customer premises equipment CPE that includes messaging client is provisioned for messaging service s . Such logic can be embodied in code instructions and in an aspect it can be retained in logic store as a static or dynamic linkable library. To identify an international destination router component can apply a rule in the set or rules that tags an address in the received message e.g. MS communication that represents a device number that according to a dialing plan begins with 011n or with n with n an alphanumeric digit different than 1 . In aspect an address e.g. that is identified as an international destination and is available in an address book or user profile s e.g. can be flagged to associate an alias e.g. contact name or nickname linked with the address with the international destination and thus reduce processing related to application of the rule when the alias is present in further messaging service session s . If the address identified as an international destination is not available in the address book or user profile s e.g. a notification can be rendered in a device mobile or otherwise that hosts the messaging client component e.g. to prompt a request to include the address in the address book or user profile e.g. . The notification can be conveyed to a display interface not shown as part of signaling .

For an MS communication that does not include an address identified as an international destination a rule within logic store when applied or executed by router component for example can direct router component to deliver the message in accordance with a configured messaging transport protocol e.g. MMS protocol SIMPLE XMPP or the like. The configured MS transport protocol can be established by a network operator and is re configurable based in part on events such as network upgrades adoption of new radio technology standards or the like. In the alternative for an identified international destination in a set of addresses of intended recipients logic retained in logic store can include rule s that when applied or executed e.g. by router component can direct router component to implement an exception handling procedure to route the MS communication .

Router component can implement or execute various exception handling procedures to route a received message e.g. MS communication that includes an international destination. Implementation or execution of such exception handling procedures can be part of logic e.g. retained in logic store to route a received MS communication. In an aspect exception handling procedures can include a content based procedure or an interoperability based procedure such procedures can be implemented separately or in combination. Content based exception handling procedure. In the subject exception handling procedure router component can convey the received message that includes an international destination to a format component that can determine format of content e.g. conveyed in the received message and supply an indication of the format to router component . In a scenario in which the received message carries text only content router component can route the received message via a transport protocol for text delivery e.g. SMS protocol or SMTP a network operator can configure such transport protocol based in part on available interoperability amongst domestic and international carriers. In view of maturity of SMS protocol interoperability is substantial and thus it can be a suitable transfer protocol for text only delivery. In an aspect in case the received message that carries text only content is a non group message e.g. K 1 in MS communication router component can deliver the non group message without further processing. However if the received message is a group message e.g. K 1 in MS communication router component can signal format component to ungroup the group message and return a plurality of two or more messages which can be delivered in point to point fashion by router component via the configured protocol for text only delivery e.g. SMS protocol or SMTP.

If the content of the received message is not text only router component can direct format component to ungroup the received message and identify one or more recipients associated with respective one or more international destinations. To at least such end format component can apply the rule in logic store that allows identification of addresses included in the received message if one or more of such address es is are tagged address es as discussed supra format component can bypass application of such rule. After identification of the one or more recipients associated with international destination s format component can compose a new group message for a set of recipients that includes a portion of the originally intended recipients for the received message and excludes the one or more recipients associated with international destination s . Router component can collect the new group message and deliver it in accordance with a predetermined transport protocol for delivery of group messages e.g. MMS protocol. In addition router component can effect an exception handling procedure for the identified international destination s . In an aspect as part of such exception handling procedure router component can notify a device that originates the received message that includes international destination s that such international destination s are unreachable. Other error or status messages also can be delivered. In another aspect router component can deliver remediation message s as part of the notification to the device wherein a recommendation for alternative communication mechanisms can be conveyed. The notification can be conveyed as part of signaling . Moreover router component can deliver a status message to the one or more recipients associated with international destination s via a transport protocol different from the predetermined transport protocol for delivery of a group message. Such status message can be conveyed through SMS protocol and can provide at least one of an indication that a group message intended for the international destination failed or a list of recipients for the group message intended for the international destination.

Interoperability based exception handling procedure. Implementation of the subject exception handling procedure can require added complexity in a messaging client component that manages at least in part a messaging service. As illustrated in example system represented in messaging client component also termed herein and annexed drawings messaging client can include integrity component that can access network data on network interoperability from messaging server for example via signaling and can supply such network data to router platform which can exploit such information to route the received message that includes one or more international destination s . Integrity component can utilize various mechanisms to access the network data on network interoperability or interoperability information. As an example integrity component can pull interoperability information from a network database via messaging server . In an aspect network database can be embodied in one or more of a Home Subscriber Server HSS a Home Location Register HLR a Visited Location Register VLR a backend service database. Network database can be functionally connected to messaging server through interface which can include at least one of a conventional wired link a wireless link or a reference link and associated component s . As another example network database or a manager component thereof can push the network data in interoperability towards integrity component . The network data on interoperability can be accessed at predetermined intervals or based on events such as updates to a network that administers a messaging server that exploits messaging server . The accessed network data on interoperability can be retained in interoperability intelligence store or interoperability intelligence within memory which is functionally coupled to messaging client component .

Based at least on available interoperability information for network operator s or a marketplace associated with at least one international destination in a received message e.g. MS communication router component can determine interoperability of a predetermined transport protocol provisioned to deliver group message s . If the predetermined transport protocol e.g. MMS protocol SIMPLE XMPP is interoperable the group message that includes the at least one international destination can be delivered in accordance with the predetermined transport protocol. In the alternative if router component establishes that the predetermined protocol transport is not interoperable and the received message is a group message router component can direct format component to ungroup the group message identify one or more recipients associated with the at least one international destination and generate a new group message for a set of recipients that exclude the one or more recipients associated with the at least on international destination. As described supra router component can collect the new group message and deliver it in accordance with the predetermined transport protocol. In addition router component can implement an exception handling procedure for the at least one international destination as described supra.

For a message e.g. MS communication that includes at least one international destination router component also can exploit interoperability information to signal format component to pack the message which can be received in a first protocol transport that is not interoperable with network operator s associated with the international destination into a second transport protocol that is interoperable with the network operator s . Format component can pack or reformat the received message automatically through extraction of the message s content e.g. content and address es e.g. and generation of a new message in the second transport protocol. In an aspect to reformat the received message from the first transport protocol to the second transport protocol can execute a set of code instructions retained in memory e.g. accessible to format component .

In an aspect similarly to messaging server messaging server can be embodied in a gateway node e.g. Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN a network management component e.g. Serving GPRS Support Node SGSN Mobility Management Entity MME a Session Border Control SBC node an application server or the like.

The logic to deliver a MS communication described herein provides a messaging client e.g. or messaging server e.g. with intelligent routing. At least one advantage of such intelligent routing is that interoperability aspects of messaging service transport protocol s are accounted for as part of routing or delivery of MS communication s thus routing or delivery of the MS communication s to international destinations becomes robust and more accurate compared to conventional messaging services. Accordingly routing or delivery robustness and correctness mitigates issues such as billing inaccuracies due to for example undeliverable data that is recorded as consumed data an issue that can affect particularly subscriber s without a data plan and thus can promote a positive end user perceived quality of service with respect to the network operator that administers the messaging service.

In view of the example system s described above example method s that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter can be better appreciated with reference to flowcharts in . For purposes of simplicity of explanation methods disclosed herein are presented and described as a series of acts however it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of acts as some acts may occur in different orders and or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example one or more methods disclosed herein could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as in a state diagram. Moreover interaction diagram s or call flow s may represent one or more methods described herein in accordance with the disclosed subject matter when disparate entities enact disparate portions of the one or more methods. Furthermore not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a described method in accordance with the subject specification. Further yet two or more of the disclosed methods can be implemented in combination to accomplish one or more features or advantages described herein.

Methods disclosed throughout the subject specification and annexed drawings are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to computers for execution and thus implementation by a processor or for storage in a memory. In an aspect one or more processors such as processor s that enact the method s described herein can be employed to execute code instructions retained in a memory or any computer or machine readable medium to implement method s described herein the code instructions provide a computer or machine executable framework to enact the method s described herein.

At act a message intended to one or more recipients is received as part of a messaging service the message is received according to a first transport protocol which can be determined based on the contents of the message. For example if the message content includes media the first transport protocol can be MMS protocol whereas if the message content only includes text the first transport protocol can be SMS. Each recipient is operationally linked to a device that can receive and process content conveyed as part of the message or messaging service MS communication and is identified through an address as described supra.

At act a number of international destinations e.g. addresses associated with the one or more recipients is ascertained. A component such as router component can implement the subject act. In an aspect ascertaining an international destination e.g. address includes identifying at least one address linked to the one or more recipients that according to a dialing plan represents a device number that begins with 011k or with k wherein k is an alphanumeric digit different than 1 . In addition ascertaining the number of international destinations can include generating and retaining e.g. in memory at least one of a logical variable for each destination e.g. an address that identifies such destination as an international destination or a single logical variable associated with the group message that tags such message as containing an international destination.

At act it is probed if the group message includes at least one international destination. The probing act can include polling a memory e.g. to determine a value of logical variable s that identify a group message as containing an international destination. If the message includes at least one international destination at act an exception handling procedure is conducted to route the group message. A negative outcome of act leads to act in which it is probed if the message is a group message. In the negative case e.g. the message is intended to one recipient at act the message is delivered according to the first transport protocol. In the alternative if the message is a group message act the message is delivered according to a second transport protocol which can be a predetermined transport protocol provisioned for communication of group message s in a messaging service. As an example the second transport protocol can be MMS protocol. A network operator or telecommunication carrier can provision the predetermined transport protocol based on network infrastructure capabilities and suitable business metrics e.g. mobile devices marketed to network subscribers. In an aspect the second transport protocol can be the same protocol as the first transport protocol for delivery of a non group message e.g. a point to point message.

At act it is probed if the format of the content in the original group message is text only. In the affirmative case at act the group message is routed via a transport protocol for text delivery. In an aspect such transport protocol can be most any or any highly interoperable protocol amongst domestic and international network operators for instance SMS protocol. The transport protocol for text delivery can be selected based on routing logic retained in a memory functionally coupled to component s or processor s that enact the subject example method . In the negative case if the group message includes content other than text such as media e.g. picture s music or video clip s . . . hyperlink s to web based content etc. flow is directed to act in which it is evaluated if the original message is a group message e.g. a message intended for a plurality of two or more recipients.

At act in which the original group message is ungrouped and a recipient associated with the at least one international destination is identified. In an aspect router component can implement act . At act a new group message intended to a set of recipients of the original group message that excludes the recipient associated with the at least one international destination. In an example scenario format component can generate the new group message. At act the new group message is conveyed according to a provisioned transport protocol for group message delivery. A network operator that administers a messaging service in which the original message is supplied can provision the transport protocol. As an example the provisioned transport protocol can be MMS protocol however other transport protocols such as IMPS protocol SIMPLE or XMPP can be employed for group message delivery.

At act an exception handling procedure is implemented for the at least one international destination. The exception handling procedure can include aspects described supra such as notifying e.g. through delivery of signaling e.g. or a device that originates the group message that the at least one international destination is unreachable or delivering a status message to the recipient via a transport protocol different from the standard transport protocol for group message delivery.

At act for network operator s associated with at least one international destination in an original group message interoperability of a transport protocol provisioned to deliver group message s is determined. In an aspect the original message is the message of act and thus can be a point to point message e.g. intended for one recipient or a group message e.g. intended for a plurality of two or more recipients. The transport protocol can be the first transport protocol of act and can be provisioned by a network operator platform or component s therein. As an example the transport protocol can be MMS protocol however as described supra other transport protocols can embody the predetermined transport protocol. As described supra e.g. see determining interoperability of the transport protocol can be based in part on at least one of accessing data on network interoperability available to a network operator that administer a messaging service that serves the original group message or aggregating the data on interoperability into actionable information such as report s that tags one or more transport protocols as interoperable or non interoperable.

At act it is probed if the transport protocol is interoperable. The probing can include polling actionable information on network interoperability. In the affirmative case at act the original message is delivered according to the transport protocol. In the negative case flow is directed to act in which it is evaluated if the original message is a group message. In the affirmative case flow is directed to act . Conversely flow is directed to act . At act in which the original group message is ungrouped and a recipient associated with the at least one international destination identified. At act a new group message intended to a set of recipients of the original group message that excludes the recipient associated with the at least one international destination is generated. At act the new group message is conveyed according to the transport protocol. At act an exception handling procedure is implemented for the at least one international destination is implemented the subject act is substantially the same as act .

A positive outcome of act leads to act in which the message is formatted according to the second transport protocol or alternative transport protocol. As described supra formatting the message can be carried out automatically by a component within a messaging client component e.g. or a messaging server e.g. in an aspect the component can be format component . At act the message is delivered according to the second protocol. However a negative outcome of act leads to act in which an exception handling procedure for the at least one international destination is implemented the subject act is substantially the same as act or .
