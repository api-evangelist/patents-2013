The present invention is related to U.S. Pat. No. 5 831 609 filed Jun. 6 1995 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 481 743 filed May 25 2002 the disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to remote viewing. More specifically the present invention relates to aggregated search.

Individuals currently have a variety of options for communicating and carrying out transactions. Such options may include traditional desktop computing devices as well as various mobile devices e.g. mobile phones smartphones tablets . In fact many individuals may use multiple computing and mobile devices at home work and on the move. For example an individual may use a desktop computer at work a laptop computer at home and one or more mobile devices e.g. smartphone tablet elsewhere. As such people have come to expect to be able to have access to data and computing resources so to perform most computing tasks anywhere.

One difficulty in meeting such an expectation is that the various computing devices may not all have the same capabilities. For example such devices may run different operating systems platforms and applications. Such differences may make it difficult to support the same tasks across such devices. One solution has been to provide remote desktops where a first device runs the applications and a second device receives the visual display that appears on the first device over a communication network e.g. Internet . Such remote desktops can allow users to access and control resources and data on the first device at a remote location using a second e.g. portable device.

One drawback to such an approach arises from the fact that such devices are generally used differently so applications may be optimized for one type of device but not another. For example the different devices may have different sizes and input options e.g. keyboard keypad touchscreen . The display of one device may not be optimized for a second device. For example if a desktop computer display is shrunk to fit on a smartphone screen the shrunken size may be difficult for the user to read or discern what is being displayed. Alternatively if the display is not shrunken the smartphone may only be able to display a portion of the original display at a time which also adds to the difficulty in reading and discerning what is being displayed. While some devices allow for manual adjustment of the display by the user changing displays and images may require the user to continually re adjust the display which may be unwieldy and inconvenient. Such is the case in many applications where content only uses a portion of the screen and user interface portions e.g. toolbars status bars scroll bars rulers .

Likewise use of each particular device may vary based on its other specifications including processing ability memory availability of applications etc. For example a desktop computer allows for multi tasking involving the concurrent use of multiple applications multiple documents etc. The ability to multi task on a mobile device may be more limited in comparison.

Embodiments of the present invention include systems and methods for aggregated search. A user using a client device may provide a search request concerning a file hosted at a remote host. It is determined that the client device has an open session with each of a plurality of remote hosts. Search commands are generated and sent to the remote hosts. Such search commands may be based on an application programming interface specific to the particular remote hosts. Search results may be received from the remotes hosts. The search results may then displayed on the client device in a consolidated list which may be sorted according to any parameter selected by the user and or known in the art.

Various embodiments of the present invention include methods for aggregated search. Such methods may include receiving a search request on a client device for a remote file and executing instructions by a processor to determine that the client device has an open session with each of a plurality of remote hosts and generate a plurality of search commands to the remote hosts. An exemplary search command may be based on an application programming interface specific to one of the remote hosts. Such search commands may be sent to the possible remote hosts and search results may be received by the client device in return. The client device may generate a display of search results received by the client device from one or more of the remote hosts in response to the search commands.

Embodiments of the present invention may further include systems for aggregated search. Such systems may include one or more host devices and a client device requesting document information from a host device. Each host device may host a plurality of files that are available to the client device via individual sessions. The client device may receive a search request from a user determine which host devices are currently available via session generate a search command for each available host device receive search results in response and generate a display listing the search results.

Other embodiments of the present invention include non transitory computer readable storage media on which is embodied instructions executable to perform a method for aggregated search as previously set forth above.

Communication network may be a local proprietary network e.g. an intranet and or may be a part of a larger wide area network e.g. the cloud . The communications network may be a local area network LAN which may be communicatively coupled to a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. The Internet is a broad network of interconnected computers and servers allowing for the transmission and exchange of Internet Protocol IP data between users connected through a network service provider. Examples of network service providers are the public switched telephone network a cable service provider a provider of digital subscriber line DSL services or a satellite service provider. Communications network allows for communication between the various components of network environment .

Users may use any number of different electronic computing user devices A D which may include general purpose computers mobile phones smartphones personal digital assistants PDAs portable computing devices e.g. laptop netbook tablets desktop computing devices handheld computing device or any other type of computing device capable of communicating over communication network . Such devices A D may also be configured to access data from other storage media such as memory cards or disk drives as may be appropriate in the case of downloaded services. Such devices A D may include standard hardware computing components such as network and media interfaces non transitory computer readable storage memory and processors for executing instructions that may be stored in memory.

User device A is illustrated as a mobile phone or smartphone user device B is illustrated as a tablet computing device user device C is illustrated as a desktop computing device and user device D is illustrated as a laptop computing device. As can be seen each device is sized differently and or has different input options. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention allow for tasks and applications that are specific to one device e.g. operating in a Microsoft Windows environment to be used and optimized for another user device e.g. operating in an Apple iOS environment .

Each user device may act as a host device interacting with another user device that acts as a client likewise each user device may act as the client device in communication with another user device acting as a host. A user device may further include a client application a client 3D library and a client display driver. Collectively these elements may enable the user device and the user to consume computer graphics resources or services provided by server .

Server may include any type of server or other computing device as is known in the art including standard hardware computing components such as network and media interfaces non transitory computer readable storage memory and processors for executing instructions or accessing information that may be stored in memory. The functionalities of multiple servers may be integrated into a single server. Any of the aforementioned servers or an integrated server may take on certain client side cache or proxy server characteristics. These characteristics may depend on the particular network placement of the server or certain configurations of the server.

Server may associated with the same user and located in the same local network as user device . Alternatively server may be located remotely e.g. in the cloud and may be associated with a third party that provides services in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In some instances the services may be provided via software e.g. software as a service downloaded from server to one or more user devices . Updated software may similarly be downloaded as the updates become available or as needed. In this regard host service may be associated with one or more servers that specifically provides hosting services through the cloud.

Server application may represent an application executing running on server . The functionality of server application may be visible to and accessible by client via application publishing over the cloud e.g. communication network such as that supported by GraphOn GO Global Microsoft Remote Desktop Services and Citrix XenApp. Examples of server application may include a computer aided design CAD application such as AutoCAD by Autodesk Inc. of San Rafael Calif. or Cadence Virtuoso by Cadence Design Systems of San Jose Calif. a medical clinical workflow application such as Symbia.net by Siemens AG of Munich Germany an interactive mapping application such as Google Earth by Google Inc of Mountain View Calif. or a 3D game.

In method of a search request is received from a user using client device it is determined which host devices are available via an open session with the client device a search command is generates for each available host device the search commands are sent to the respective host devices search results from the respective host devices are received and a display of the received search results is generated and displayed on the client device.

In step a search request is received from a client device e.g. user device B . In some embodiments the indication may be entered by the user onto the client device B via touchscreen which may display one or more options for available hosts folders and or documents. The user may enter or designate any variety of search parameters known in the art for searching files. For example the user may enter full or partial file names sizes content within the file e.g. full text search or any combination of the same. While the term document or document specific terms may be used herein for convenience the user may specify any kind of text graphic spreadsheet slide and other file known in the art that is capable of being accessed on a user device . Alternatively the user may have saved a previous search or otherwise allowed for certain default search options. is a screenshot of a display regarding Recent Files which may be considered a type of default search for files that were most recently accessed. also illustrates a search box in the upper right hand corner of the display where the user may further narrow the search or otherwise change the search parameters.

In step it is determined which host devices are available to the client device via open sessions. In some embodiments client device B may connect to any host device e.g. user devices C D that are connected to the communication network and that allow a session to be opened with client device B. In some cases a session may be opened using a software application downloaded to the user devices A D participating in the session. As a result of step it may be determined that client device B has two host devices C D as well as a host service available.

In step a search command is generated for each host device or service identified in step . In some cases generating a search command for a particular host device C or host service may involve use of a particular application programming interface API wrapper or other search format known in the art. Referring the foregoing example client device B may generate three search commands one for host device C one for host device D and one for host service .

In step the search commands are sent to the respective host devices and search results are received in response. As noted above with respect to step the search request may include any combination of search parameters known in the art for finding a file. In that regard once the search command is received at a host device C the host device C may execute the search command to retrieve information regarding files matching the search parameters specified by the search command. No file one file or multiple files may be found be meet the search parameters. That information may be sent from host device C to client device B.

In step a display is generated on client device B regarding the collective search results received from the host devices C D and or host service . Referring to such a display may appear as a set of icons. Alternative displays may include thumbnails tiles lists and any additional details associated with the files indicated by the search results. For example a display may indicate which host device is currently hosting each file. The display may also sort the search results based on any detail associated with the files e.g. by host device . From the display a user of the client device B may be able to select and access such files.

Such access to a file may further include accessing a particular application associated with the same. Being associated with an application means that the document may be accessed viewed or the contents otherwise manipulated using the application. The document may be any kind of document known in the art and associated with any application known in the art. User selection of the file is further not necessarily limited by the particular applications that are available on the client device B or the particular host device C that hosts the file.

Where the session to host device C is already open and includes access to other files selection of the file may involve initiating a new application instance. The client device B or application on client device B may also update the number of instances or number of files from host device C are viewed displayed on client device B. In that regard when the user closes all files from a host device B the remote session with host device C may be closed as well.

Moreover depending on the particular file e.g. type size file extension the file may be downloaded to client device B or viewed remotely on client device B. Various algorithms may be used to evaluate each file to determine which may be the fastest way to access the requested file in light of the particular file application client device network connectivity and other status information known in the art. In addition user preferences may also be considered in determining whether to download to or enable remote viewing.

There may also be instances where the host device C may not host the application associated with the selected file. In that regard the client device B may determine whether it client device B or another host device D may host an application that may be used to open view or manipulate the first document. Wherever a file or application is located the user is provided with the ability to direct and combine such remote resources so as to be able to open view and other manipulate the file within the window display of the client device B.

In a remote access system such as client server computing system the remoting software may be installed and executing i.e. running on a host device e.g. host device C . Such software may allow users to remotely access applications that are installed on host device C. By way of example a set of applications may be installed on host device C. Such applications represent any applications programs and or processes executing i.e. running on host device C. The functionality of the applications shall be visible to and accessible by client devices e.g. client device B via communication network using a process herein known as application publishing which is currently supported by such products as GraphOn GO Global Microsoft Remote Desktop Services and Citrix XenApp. Such application publishing may be also performed in accordance with teachings of commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5 831 609 filed Jun. 6 1995 and entitled Method and system for dynamic translation between different graphical user interface systems which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Such functionalities are also described in further detail in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 481 743 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Where there are multiple possible application that can be used to open the first document the user may designate a preferred application for the document type or the user may be provided with a menu of the possible applications for selection.

Selection of a file may also initiate a tab display in a window of client device B. The client device B may generate an image display that corresponds to a tabbed display such as appears in the screenshot of . As illustrated the screenshot includes a tab bar near the top of the display. Underneath the tab bar is a display view associated with the currently selected tab. Such views may include views of any document file folder bookmarks or other type of content known in the art as capable of being displayed in a tab view. A user may switch between views e.g. of different documents by selecting the associated tab which may remain visible or which may be summoned at any time within the window display of the client device B. In there is a tab titled Recent Files a tab titled Work and a tab titled report.jpg. The current view in the window display is that associated with Recent Files but if the user selects report.jpg. the window display would switch to the view associated with report.jpg. Likewise while viewing report.jpg the user may select another tab which switches to a corresponding view. Such ability to switch views efficiently allows for in app multi tasking within the display window of a remote client device B where multiple remotely hosted documents to be openable viewable and manipulable from within one window application.

The user may select another document of interest. The second document may be the same or a different application from that of the first document. In addition the second document may be hosted by a different remote host. The window display of the client device B may include a view of the second requested document along with one or more other tabs including the tab associated with the first requested document. The user may select any other tab to switch views to a different document or folder . As illustrated in there may be a tab that allows for the addition for more tabs. Moreover each tab may be associated with an option for closing the document associated with the same. When a document is closed such closure may be tracked so as to allow for determining whether a session with a particular host should be closed as well. The user may also choose to save any edits as well as designate whether and where the edited document should be saved.

Various embodiments of the present invention allow for the method to be performed by an intermediary device e.g. server which may be associated with the host device or reside elsewhere in the network e.g. in the cloud . For example server may receive the request from a requesting client device B forward to a host client devices C D and or host service receive responsive data from host client devices C D use the responsive data to generate the display instructions for client device B display which may then be sent to client device B.

Alternatively the method may be performed by software e.g. an application downloaded to a user device B. For example software located at requesting client device B may receive the user requests forward the requests to host devices services C D receive responsive data responsive to the request as provided by host client device C use the responsive display data to generate the instructions for client device B display which may then be sent or otherwise provided to client device B for execution.

The present invention may be implemented in an application that may be operable using a variety of devices. Non transitory computer readable storage media refer to any medium or media that participate in providing instructions to a central processing unit CPU for execution. Such media can take many forms including but not limited to non volatile and volatile media such as optical or magnetic disks and dynamic memory respectively. Common forms of non transitory computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk a hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM disk digital video disk DVD any other optical medium RAM PROM EPROM a FLASHEPROM and any other memory chip or cartridge.

Various forms of transmission media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a CPU for execution. A bus carries the data to system RAM from which a CPU retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by system RAM can optionally be stored on a fixed disk either before or after execution by a CPU. Various forms of storage may likewise be implemented as well as the necessary network interfaces and network topologies to implement the same.
