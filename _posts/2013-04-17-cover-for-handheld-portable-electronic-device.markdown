Smartphones tablet computers and other handheld portable electronic devices HPEDs are expensive. Users often place hard plastic covers on these devices to protect them from being scratched and damaged. The plastic covers are often placed on the devices for permanent use throughout the lifecycle of the devices.

Example embodiments include systems apparatus and methods related to a cover for a handheld portable electronic device HPED . Users select designs and apply these selected designs to a cover in order to custom design the cover for HPEDs. The designs are printed on a foldable and printable material such as paper that is folded shaped and or assembled into the cover for the HPED. The designs can also be printed on removable hard plastic covers that form an integrated part of a body of the HPED.

In an example embodiment a computer system displays a user interface UI and or a graphical user interface GUI that creates a foldable and printable cover for the HPED. The computer system simultaneously displays an image selector and an image of the HPED with a cover around the HPED. Alternatively the image selector is simultaneously displayed with the cover and or a template that folds and or assembles to become the cover.

The computer system also provides a UI and or GUI that creates custom designs on hard plastic covers integrated cases and displays or screens of HPEDs. The hard plastic covers and displays form part of the body of the HPED such as forming front and back exterior surfaces of the HPED. Selected images are applied to the covers and or displays with techniques such as laser etching and printing. For example images of a user or images selected by a user are retrieved and permanently imprinted on the covers and or displays.

An image selector enables users to select images that appear on different surfaces or zones of the cover. For example a user can download photos to the cover select from a library of predetermined photos and or images write text to the cover add graphics to the cover change colors of different surfaces of the cover add backgrounds to the surfaces and perform other designs to the surfaces of the cover. In this manner users are able to custom design a cover for their HPED or select from many different predetermined designs.

Alternatively the cover can be designed by a user agent of the user a software application an HPED and or an electronic device. This design is based on personal preferences and information in a user profile of the user. For instance a user agent of a user consults a user profile of the user determines favorite photographs of the user and uploads these favorite photographs onto exterior surfaces of a cover for an HPED of the user. The user agent has the cover assembled and provided to the user.

In an example embodiment the UI provides a two dimensional or three dimensional view of the HPED with a blank or white cover. The cover includes surfaces and or zones that receive and display designs that are input from the user user agent HPED software application and or an electronic device. For example the user takes a picture with an HPED and the picture immediately appears in real time on one or more of the surfaces of an image of the cover. Subsequently the cover is fabricated with the images on its surface. As another example a user interacts with a display screen to draw on surfaces of the cover such as drawing with a drawing tool or a finger of the user on the display. Additionally the user can select images with the image selector and or select images from a library of images to place on a surface of the cover. When an image is selected for placement on the cover the image appears in real time on the cover of an HPED being displayed on the display screen. As such a user can view what the actual cover will look like during the design of the cover before the cover is produced.

In an example embodiment once the cover is designed with the UI the design is transferred to a template that represents the cover in an unassembled state. The template has different zones that correspond to the zones or surfaces of the cover. For example if a user selects a series of photographs to appear on the cover then these photographs are transferred to different locations on the template. The template can have one or more zones on a portion of its surfaces or include zones across all of its surfaces and or surface area.

A printer then prints the template onto a pliable piece of material such as paper or other medium. The template is folded and secured such as being glued into a cover that was represented by the cover that appeared on the UI of the computer system.

The design can be printed folded and assembled into the cover by the user or by a third party such as by a manufacturer and or a printer company . If the design is assembled by a third party then the design is shipped to the user. The design can also be transmitted stored provided to the user provided to a software application provided to an electronic device and or provided to a third party.

Consider an example in which after the images are transferred to the template the template is provided to the user such as being emailed to the user downloaded to the user transmitted to the user printed for the user etc. . The user prints the template and then folds it into the cover. Alternatively the template is transmitted to a manufacturer that assembles the cover and then provides it to the user such as mailing or shipping the assembled cover to a shipping address designated by the user or another party .

Additionally when the cover is assembled and sent to the user it can be packaged to protect it from being damaged. For example if the cover is made from paper then it is assembled into a size and shape of the HPED and then the cover is placed around a protective insert. For instance this protective insert has a size and shape of the HPED so the cover will not be compressed during shipping.

Alternatively the cover can be formed from a foldable material that does not easily damage such as being formed from TYVEK or other material. In this instance the cover is assembled compressed or flattened placed in an envelope and shipped to the user. A protective insert is not used since the cover will not damage when flattened and placed into an envelope.

In an example embodiment the template has a pattern based on a selected HPED such that when the template is folded and or assembled it has a size and shape that emulates a size and shape of the HPED or emulates a portion of the size and the shape of the HPED. Different makes and models of HPEDs can have different sizes and shapes. A different template is provided for each of these different HPEDs. Furthermore different templates can be provided for a same HPED.

Consider an example in which company ABC manufactures a line of smartphones that have different sizes and or shapes. Each one of these smartphones has one or more templates associated with the smartphone. For instance smartphone model XYZ has two different templates associated with the smartphone. Each template offers a different style of cover for this smartphone. For instance one template covers fives sides of the smartphone and includes a transparent window through which a display on the smartphone is visible while it is enclosed in the cover. Another template covers six sides of the smartphone and includes a movable flap that covers the display on the smartphone while it is enclosed in the cover.

In an example embodiment the cover snuggly fits over the outer surface of the HPED and provides a protective covering or enclosure. This covering can cover portions of the outer surface area of the HPED or all of the outer surface area of the HPED such as cover 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 100 of a total outer surface area of the HPED . Alternatively the cover can form portions of the body of the HPED such as forming a back cover and or front cover. For instance the front and back covers are included in the original HPED sold to consumers.

In example embodiments users are thus able to design custom and or unique covers since their designs are formed and or printed on the outer and inner surfaces of the cover. The users are also able to select from different types or styles of covers for their HPED.

The kiosk is a small enclosure or structure that is used to sell merchandise such as covers for HPEDs. The kiosk includes a processor that communicates with a memory a display a camera and a printer . Some kiosks are booths or enclosures that receive payment for rendering a service and or producing a product.

In an example embodiment the display provides a user interface UI or graphical user interface GUI that enables a user to interact with the kiosk to design custom covers for HPEDs. The camera takes pictures of the user and these pictures are then transferred to a template. The printer prints the template on a foldable medium to produce a printed template . The printed template is customized since it includes the selected pictures and includes instructions that describe with words and or pictures how to fold the template into a size and shape of a cover for the HPED. Alternatively the kiosk can perform a series of fold and adhesive operations on the printed template to generate an assembled cover for the user.

The servers include processing units that communicate with computer readable medium CRM to execute operations and tasks that implement or assist in implementing example embodiments. By way of example the servers include hardware and or software that are dedicated to run a service for custom designing and or fabricating a cover for HPEDs. For example the servers provide productivity and or information retrieval for mobile applications that execute on HPEDs and electronic devices. For instance HPEDs include and execute one or more mobile software applications that are available through and or downloaded from an application distribution platform such as an online store hosted by the servers . The applications can function alone and or communicate with the servers to custom design a cover for HPEDs and or execute blocks and or methods discussed herein.

The HPEDs can be connected to and or in communication with one or more printers that print designs and pictures on the templates and or covers. These printers include cloud printers that enable users to send print jobs over the web or Internet to remotely located printers. Examples of these printers include but are not limited to ink jet toner laser cutting laser thermal 3D and dot matrix.

The manufacturer and or printer prints templates and or manufacturers covers according to job requests. Users user agents software applications and or HPEDs send jobs over the networks to the manufacturer that processes and completes the jobs for the requestor. The jobs include designing a custom template and or cover printing a template and or cover folding and or assembling a template into a cover shipping assembled and or printed covers in various stages of assembly to shipping addresses and executing methods and or blocks discussed herein.

In an example embodiment a computer at the manufacturer receives a job to print and assemble a custom cover for an HPED and or user. The computer designs or retrieves a layout of pictures for the cover. For example the job request includes a template with a custom layout of unique pictures patterns and text. As another example the computer designs the layout for the user based on a user profile of the user. The computer instructs a printer to print the layout on foldable and printable material such as paper. This layout appears on the printed material in the form of a printed template that is sent to a paper folding machine PFM . This machine is in communication with the computer and folds the printed material into a cover for the HPED.

Production of the cover includes but is not limited to printing cutting folding assembling adhering attaching and stitching. By way of example once the cover is folded and assembled together e.g. using glue or an adhesive to secure the folds the cover can be shipped to a shipping address. Alternatively the cover can be shipped at different stages of assembly or production. For example a specialty material is precut scored and then mailed to a user for custom printing and or final assembly.

The cover can be made of a material that can be compressed without damaging the structure of the cover such as being made from TYVEK or other material . In this instance the cover is compressed inserted into an envelope and shipped and or mailed. Alternatively the cover can be made of a material that cannot be compressed or further folded without damaging the structure of the cover such as being made of paper that shows creases or folds when compressed or folded . In this instance a protective insert is inserted into an opening of the cover. This insert has a shape and size of the HPED that the cover is designed to enclose. The insert is made from an inexpensive lightweight material such as being made from recycled cardboard . Shipping paper or an envelope is then placed around the cover and insert to produce an assembled product ready for shipping . This assembly includes a shipping address on an exterior surface.

In an example embodiment the cover the insert and the HPED have an equivalent or an approximately equivalent size and shape. The cover is slightly larger than the insert and the HPED so that the cover can snugly and firmly fit on and around the insert and the HPED. A size and shape and or form factor of the insert thus emulates the size and shape and or form factor of the HPED. Furthermore a size and shape and or form factor of the assembled package is equivalent or approximately equivalent to a size and shape and or form factor of the HPED positioned inside of the cover . The assembled package is slightly larger than the HPED with the cover by an amount roughly equal to a thickness of the envelope .

The electronic devices include but are not limited to kiosks HPEDs electronic devices with cellular or mobile phone capabilities digital cameras desktop computers servers portable computers such as tablet and notebook computers handheld audio playing devices example handheld devices for downloading and playing music and videos personal digital assistants PDAs combinations of these devices and other portable and non portable electronic devices and systems. An example of an electronic device and or server also appears in .

The networks can include one or more of the internet an intranet an extranet a cellular network a local area network LAN a home area network HAN metropolitan area network MAN a wide area network WAN public and private networks etc.

The storage can include various types of storage that include but are not limited to magnetic storage and optical storage such as hard disks magnetic tape disk cartridges universal serial bus USB flash memory compact disk read only memory CD ROM digital video disk read only memory DVD ROM CD recordable memory CD rewritable memory photoCD and web based storage. Storage can include storage pools that are hosted by third parties such as an operator of a data center. The HPEDs electronic devices computers and or servers can use the storage to store files software applications data objects etc. Storage can be accessed through a web service application programming interface a web based user interface or other mechanisms.

Block states displaying on a display a template that is marked with zones to display selected images.

Consider an example in which the template is displayed on a display of an electronic device and is provided with visible zones that signify locations where selected images appear. These zones mark boundaries that provide locations on the template where the selected images appear. For example the zones appear as areas on the template that are distinguished from each other and or from non zoned areas. Techniques to mark the zones and to provide this distinction include but are not limited to using different colors lines such as dashed lines dotted lines or dark lines shades hatching including cross hatching visible patterns symbols indicia text and images.

Block states displaying on the display and with the template an image of the HPED with a cover that has surfaces to display the selected images. The HPED can be displayed with or without the cover on the HPED.

Consider an example in which the HPED has a rectangular configuration with six different sides or surfaces a front surface a back surface two side surfaces and two end surfaces . One or more of these surfaces can receive and display the selected images. For example if the cover fits around five of the different sides then the cover can have images on these five different sides. As another example the cover forms part of the HPED such as including the display screen of the HPED.

Block states displaying on the display with the template and with the image of the HPED with the cover an image selector that displays images that when selected appear as the selected images on the zones of the template and on the surfaces of the cover that is around the image of the HPED.

Consider an example in which the image selector is a software tool that provides and or displays images that can be selected for printing on the cover. The image selector can visually display these images on the display and or provide a mechanism to retrieve the images. For instance images are downloaded or uploaded to the electronic device appear in the image selector and then provided to the zones of the template the cover and the surfaces of the image of the HPED.

Block states selecting with the image selector the selected images such that the selected images appear on the zones of the template and on the surfaces of the cover.

Consider an example in which the image selector assists in transferring selected images to the zones of the template to the cover and or to the surfaces of the image of the HPED. For example the image selector receives images and then automatically transfers the received images to the zones of the template to the cover and or to the surfaces of the HPED. As another example the image selector displays photographs taken with the HPED or with another electronic device. A user selects one or more these photographs and the selected photographs appear on the zones of the template the cover and or surfaces of the HPED. As another example the image selector includes a library of images such as pictures geometric shapes art work drawings logos colors backgrounds posters quotes sayings labels numbers text signs insignia objects etc. A user user agent software application or electronic device selects one or more of these to place on the zones of the template the covers and or surfaces of the HPED.

Consider an example in which the template is printed on a piece of paper with a printer such as an impact printer e.g. a dot matrix printer or a non impact printer e.g. a laser printer or an inkjet printer .

Consider an example in which the template is folded at plural different locations in order to form a cover that has a size and shape of the HPED. The HPED removably inserts or fits into the cover. For instance if the HPED is shaped like a rectangular prism then the cover also has the shape of this rectangular prism. The cover has a slightly larger size than a size of the HPED. This difference in size enables the cover to snugly fit around the HPED but also allows the HPED to be inserted into and removed from the cover.

Block states display a three dimensional image of a handheld portable electronic device HPED housed in a cover that has a size and shape of the HPED.

Consider an example in which a display of an electronic device displays a three dimensional image of an HPED that includes a cover. The cover has a size and shape of the HPED in order to surround and cover an exterior surface of the HPED. For example if the HPED has a size and shape of a particular model smartphone then the cover also has this size and shape of the smartphone. The cover is slightly larger than the HPED to enable the cover to fit over and around all or a portion of the exterior surface of the HPED.

Block states display with the image of the HPED in the cover an image selector that displays pictures.

Consider an example in which the image selector is a software tool and or graphical user interface GUI that enables a user to select pictures that when selected appear on outer surfaces of the cover while the cover is around the HPED. The image selector simultaneously displays plural different pictures that can be selected to appear on the outer surfaces of the cover. For example a user drags and drops a picture displayed at the image selector to a location on the cover in order to place the selected picture on the cover. As another example the user clicks on a picture and on an outer surface of the cover to designate this outer surface as the location for the picture. As another example a user provides a command that selects a picture and that selects a location on the cover to receive and display the selected picture. Such a command can come from the user providing a voice command and or interacting with a keyboard a display or an electronic device.

Block states transfer upon selection of the pictures with the image selector the pictures to a plurality of different outer surfaces of the cover in order to create a custom design for the cover.

Consider an example in which the image selector receives a plurality of pictures from a user such as pictures taken with the HPED or with another electronic device. The image selector selects one or more of these pictures and places them at different locations on the cover. For example a user agent of the user places the pictures according to a hierarchy such as placing a first favorite picture at a first location placing a second favorite picture at a second location etc. As another example pictures are placed at predetermined or default locations such as placing a pictures of the user at a first location pictures of friends of the user at a second location and other pictures at a third location.

Block states print the pictures on a foldable template made of pliable material wherein the template is folded into the shape of the cover.

Consider an example in which a user selects pictures and designates locations for these pictures on the cover of the HPED. The pictures include images symbols and text that the user selects. These pictures are printed onto the template and the template is folded into the shape of the cover. This shape emulates the shape of the HPED such that the cover fits over and around a portion of the HPED.

Block states manufacturing and or assembling a cover for an HPED. For example an order for the cover is received and then the cover is printed folded glued and assembled into the HPED cover.

Block states placing an insert into the HPED cover. The insert has a size and shape of the HPED that will be inserted into the cover. For example if the cover is made for a tablet computer then the insert is sized and shaped as the tablet computer. If the cover is made for a smartphone then the insert is sized and shape as the smartphone.

The insert protects the HPED cover from being damaged during shipping. For example if the HPED cover is made from paper or another lightweight pliable material then the HPED cover can be easily smashed or bent. The HPED cover fits snugly around the insert and prevents the HPED cover from being smashed bent torn or otherwise damaged.

Preferably the insert is formed from a material that is one or more of strong lightweight inexpensive recyclable and readily available. Examples of this material include but are not limited to cardboard paper expanded polystyrene foam plastic and combinations of these materials.

Consider an example in which an order is received for an HPED cover that will fit over an IPHONE 5. A size and shape of this smartphone is retrieved and the insert is fabricated to emulate the size and shape of this smartphone. In other words the insert has a form factor of the smartphone that will be inserted into the cover.

Block states printing and or placing a shipping address on a mailing cover. For example the mailing cover is a piece of shipping paper or an envelope.

Block states forming a shipping package by placing a mailing cover around the HPED cover with the insert inserted inside of the HPED cover. The mailing cover can fit snugly around the exterior surface of the HPED cover and insert such that the shipping package has a size and shape of the HPED.

Consider an example in which a user orders an HPED cover for a smartphone model ABC. The HPED cover is made for this smartphone and the insert sized and shaped to emulate the smartphone ABC is inserted into the HPED cover. A paper mailing cover with a shipping address is then wrapped around the HPED cover. Since the mailing cover is made of a thin material paper in this example the overall shape and size of the HPED cover does not substantially change. For example the HPED cover approximately increases in size by the thickness of the mailing cover. As such the assembled shipping package has a form factor that emulates the form factor of the smartphone for which the HPED cover is made.

Block states mailing and or shipping the shipping package to a shipping address. For example the shipping address is printed or placed on an exterior surface of the shipping package.

In an example embodiment the template cover and or container are made from a pliable material that can be folded printed and shaped into a form factor and or size and shape of an HPED. Examples of this material include but are not limited to paper flashspun high density polyethylene fibers such as TYVEK plastic cloth fabric polymers and combinations of these items. Examples of paper include but are not limited to book paper card stock Manila paper bond paper bank paper cardboard coated paper cotton paper inkjet paper laid paper kraft paper wove paper waterproof paper TYVEK paper waterproof paper xuan paper paperboard recycled paper hologram paper glow in the dark paper and washi paper. Furthermore some types of paper can have different weights such as twenty pound 20 lb twenty four pound 24 lb thirty two pound 32 lb and sixty eight pound or cover stock 68 lb .

In an example embodiment the template and shipping package exist on and or are formed with a single piece of material. For instance the shipping package and the template are located on a same piece of material. In other words the shipping package and the template co exist on a same physical piece of material. In this embodiment a single printing process imprints the customized template the assembly instructions and the shipping address on a single sheet of material. Subsequently the template is partially cut and or partially folded without severing it from excess material located adjacent the template. This excess material is folded around the template to form a shipping package and or folded into an appropriate dummy insert shape. In this embodiment the recipient has a single seam to cut to release the template and or HPED cover from the packaging and or dummy protective insert.

Consider an example in which a user owns a tablet computer a notebook computer and a smartphone. The user decides to custom design a removable cover for one of these electronic devices. At the beginning of the design process an electronic device depicts on its display each of the users devices such as depicting a picture of the tablet computer the notebook computer and the smartphone . The user selects one of these electronic devices to indicate for which device the user intends to design a cover.

After completing a design layout for one electronic device the design layout can be translated to a different template for a different device. This allows the user to use a same or similar design layout on different HPEDs. This process saves time since the user does not design a same or similar design layout twice.

Template designs can be saved and stored with a unique name provided to the user so that the user or anyone who knows the unique name may load the customized template at any time and or request additional production. For example a template is created by one friend further customized by another friend and then printed by the first friend. The customized template can be edited or altered and saved again or it may be saved as a static read only template. For example a designer creates a custom template and shares its unique name so other users can print but not alter the template.

Consider an example in which a user wants to design a template and share or sell this template but the user wants to have one or more specific zones that are locked such that other users cannot change a design in the specific zone. For instance a promoter custom designs one or more specific zones of a template such as the front face with a logo of the promoter. These specific zones are locked and saved as read only zones i.e. the zones can be read but not written to deleted and or altered . The promoter then sells and or distributes the template to other users. These other users can customize other zones of the template but cannot alter the specific zone customized by the promoter. Furthermore because images may be confidential template designs can be encrypted prior to storage and decrypted after retrieval with a password provided by the user.

Consider another example in which a user decides to design a cover for an HPED. HPEDs with different sizes and shapes are fit with covers that have correspondingly different sizes and shapes. The user interacts with a UI to instruct for which make and model the user desires a cover. The cover and or template corresponding to this make and model is retrieved so the user can begin to design a customized cover for the HPED.

A selection of an HPED and corresponding template and or cover can also occur automatically and or with a default determination. For example a default is set such that a template and or cover are retrieved for the HPED making the request. For instance if a user uses a mobile application on a smartphone to design a cover for the smartphone then a default is to retrieve a template and or cover having a size and shape corresponding to the smartphone being used to customize the template.

The computer system printer and interface discussed herein can also be used to custom design and print other things that can be created by cutting folding and or assembling a pliable material from a template. Some examples include but are not limited to a wallet a gift envelope a booklet an information pamphlet a party hat a hand thrown glider animal figurines vehicle figurines playing cards greeting cards and origami figures.

The GUI includes an image of the HPED a cover fitted over the HPED an image selector and a template . These items are simultaneously displayed on the display of the electronic device in order to assist the user in designing a customized cover for the HPED.

The image selector enables a user to select images that will appear on the cover and or on the template. By way of example the image selector includes two columns of images. A first column includes images from a library and a second column includes custom and or unique user images.

The images from the library in column and the custom and or unique user images in column include pictures artwork designs backgrounds text logos etc. that the user can select to appear on the cover and or template. Arrows at a top and bottom of columns and enable a user to scroll upward or downward through the images.

The image selector also enables the user to upload pictures that are placed on the cover and or template . The user can upload images that appear in the second column with an upload selector shown as Upload a picture . Activation of this selector enables a user to navigate to a location to select and upload an image such as a saved picture. For example activation of the selector navigates the user to a cloud storage location or to a folder with pictures or attempts to initiate a wireless picture file transmission such as a transmission that uses Bluetooth WiFi or another transmission technology.

Additionally the electronic device includes a camera that displays a real time image on the display . The image selector includes a selector shown as Take Picture that enables a user to take a picture with the camera and then immediately have this picture displayed in the second column and or on the template and or cover. A current view of the camera is shown in real time at an image location such that this image location reveals what the camera sees. The image shown in image location also appears as the first image at the top of column . This signifies that the user took a picture of a face of a woman and this picture appears as a selectable image in column .

Column of the image selector also includes a text selector that enables users to type text onto the cover and or template . For example upon selection of the text selector a user clicks or points to a zone or area on the cover and or template and a text box or text window appears at this location. Thus a user can type text into a zone or area outside of a zone. If an image is already placed in the zone then the text superimposes over the image.

In an example embodiment users can select a hierarchy of superimposition. For example a default position is that text is superimposed over backgrounds. When multiple images and or text overlap then the interface allows the user to select the hierarchy of superimposition.

The interface allows the user to select the font size and color of the text as well as text styles and graphic effects such as 3D embossed appearance textured letters etc. The user may choose to let the software automatically size and color the text so that it fits in the zone and stands out visually from the image or background color. The interface also allows the user to drag images or text from a zone to any other zone or arbitrary position on any view and to arbitrarily scale arbitrarily rotate and or arbitrarily stretch the images and or text. Furthermore the interface allows the user to remove text and or images placed on a template.

The template is displayed as a flat and or two dimensional image with a plurality of zones A and B where images occur. These zones are marked or distinguished with an identifying feature such as showing the zones with heavy dashed lines . The zones can be visually distinguished in other ways as well such as using different colors backgrounds lines shadings symbols etc. For example a common color on a zone of the template and a zone of the image of the HPED indicates that the zone of the template and the zone of the image of the HPED correspond to each other. The template also includes one or more locations outside of the zones such as window and area . These locations represent areas where images do not occur. For instance an image does not occur at window since this area is cut out. Additionally an image does not occur at area since this area has fold lines that represent where the template is folded. Thus a user can readily distinguish between locations where an image can be placed and locations where an image is not placed.

Arrows appear adjacent the template and enable a user to scroll or navigate to different faces of the template such as changing from operating on a front view of the template to operating on a back view of the template.

After the template is folded and or assembled it forms a cover for the HPED . The GUI shows the HPED inside the cover . This cover is formed from the template after the template is folded and or assembled. The cover includes areas and or zones that correspond to the areas and or zones shown on the template. For example the template and the cover show zone B. Thus zone B on the template corresponds to a front surface of the cover.

Since the HPED is inserted into the cover and displayed on the GUI a user can readily visualize what the HPED will look like after the cover is placed on the HPED. In other words while the template and or cover are being designed a user can see how the cover will look before being produced and how the HPED will look with the cover on the HPED.

The HPED includes a display that is not enclosed by the cover . The window cutout or removed from the template fits over the display so a user can view and interact with the display while the HPED is in the cover.

The HPED and cover are shown as three dimensional 3D images on the GUI . A selector shown with an arrow and labeled 3D view enables a user to rotate the 3D image of the cover and HPED. Activation of this selector enables a user to rotate the cover and HPED about three axes the X axis the Y axis and the Z axis in order to view it from any angle.

The GUI also includes a selector shown with a box and labeled SHOW HPED that enables a user to show the cover with or without picturing the HPED as encased. For example when the box of the selector is checked such as shown in then the cover is displayed fitted in position around the HPED . When the when the box of the selector is not checked such as shown in then the cover is displayed without the HPED .

Different types of operations can be used to move and or transfer images to the cover and or template . These operations include but are not limited to dragging and dropping images clicking images locations and or zones using voice commands using pull down menus using pointing devices interacting with the display etc. Additionally images can be automatically transferred to zones of the template and or cover. For instance when an image is captured with the HPED or with the electronic device the image automatically transfers to one of the zones. As another example images that are emailed or uploaded to a social network are automatically applied to the image selector and or zones.

In an example embodiment when an image is selected and or transferred to a zone of the template and or cover the image appears on both surfaces and is automatically scaled to fit to the size and shape of the selected zone. An image can be dragged to any template view or any assembled view. Further an image can be dragged from the picture menu or from its prior placement in another view. By way of example when the image is selected and transferred to a zone the image snaps into position and is automatically sized to fit within the frame without changing the aspect ratio. The selected image appears in corresponding frames of other template views and or assembled views and or the 3D view. After placement of the image the interface allows the image to be rotated scaled moved or stretched changing the aspect ratio within the frame. Additionally an image placed on a frame or page which is already occupied will replace the image.

Consider an example in which a user selects the image of fox at the image selector . The user clicks on the image of fox and then clicks on zone B on template . The image of the fox automatically scales to appear in zone B on both the template and the cover . Consider another example in which the user drags the image of the fox from the image selector to the zone B on the cover . The image of the fox automatically appears in zone B on both the template and the cover .

The GUI in simultaneously shows the HPED the cover and the image selector the template is not displayed in this example embodiment . A first view of the cover shows the cover without the HPED while a second view of the cover shows the cover enclosing or housing the HPED . The HPED is removed from view since the box is unchecked while the HPED appears in view since the box is checked.

As shown in the HPED and the cover are shown as 3D images on the GUI . These 3D images enable a user to visualize what the customized cover will look like on the HPED during the design of the cover. While the cover is being designed the cover is shown on the selected make and model HPED for which the cover is being designed.

Consider an example in which a user selects an IPHONE 6 as the make and model of a smartphone. The image of this smartphone is then retrieved and presented on the display to the user. A template and or cover shaped and sized to fit this smartphone is also retrieved and presented on the display to the user. Thus the user sees images of the actual product and the actual cover as the cover is being designed. This enables the user to see what the smartphone will look like in the cover during the design process.

The template includes indications where to cut the material. For example these indications are shown as images of scissors cut lines and arrows that point to the fold lines. The template also includes indications where to place an adhesive. For example these indications are shown as an image of a glue bottle and strips or areas that show where to apply the glue.

The instructions include four steps that visually show how to cut out the unassembled cover and then fold and glue this cover into the shape of the assembled cover shown in step . Furthermore the instructions and the unassembled cover integrate the customizations made to the template up to that point.

The template can be updated and or changed such as providing new and or different templates for new and or different makes and model HPEDs updating graphics for assembled and 3D views and updating and or changing locations or sizes or shapes of zones.

In an example embodiment the HPED is the electronic device . In other words the GUI assists in designing a custom cover for the electronic device displaying the GUI.

In a user uses a pointing device to select a zone or area on the back side of the cover where an image will appear. The cover can have predefined zones or areas that can receive an image. In this instance a user clicks on a zone to indicate that this zone will receive an image. Additionally any zone or area of the cover can receive an image. For example a user can draw or specify boundaries for the zone or area where an image will be placed. For instance a user uses the pointing device to draw a zone on the cover with user drawn shape such as drawing a circle a square a rectangle or any other type of shape to receive an image. A selected image is then automatically scaled to fit into the user drawn zone.

By way of example shows the pointing device choosing or selecting a picture shown as a face of a man to appear in the selected zone. When the picture is selected it automatically appears in the selected zone of the cover.

In order to design the cover the user interacts with the image selector and template or unassembled cover to select zones and or areas and images to appear in the selected zones and or areas.

Example embodiments provide apparatus methods and systems to design and or assist in designing covers for electronic devices. By way of example these covers can be separate from the electronic device such as being aftermarket products that fit on and or around all or a portion of the electronic device. An example of such a cover includes a protective case or enclosure into which the electronic device is positioned after the electronic device is sold to a user. This cover is an accessory to the electronic device and may or may not be manufactured by the manufacturer of the electronic device.

As another example these covers can also include a portion of a body of the electronic device. For example a cover can include a front side or front body that forms part of the originally manufactured electronic device. As another example the cover can include a back side or back body that forms an integrated part of the electronic device. These covers also called cases can be manufactured by the manufacturer and form the product sold to the user or consumer. Furthermore these covers include the screen and or display and are often made from hard plastic silicone polymers metal and or glass. Such covers serve to house and to protect internal electronic components and to provide aesthetic appeal to the electronic device.

As yet another example these covers can also include replacement parts or components for the electronic device. For example a body of an electronic device is manufactured with a glass front cover that functions as a display and with a hard plastic back cover that connects to the front cover and encloses the internal electronic components. The manufacturer of the electronic device or another manufacturer produces and sells front covers and back covers that replace the original covers provided on the electronic device. As such users can replace and or swap covers on their HPEDs.

Consider an example in which an HPED has an exterior body that is formed having a rectangular configuration. This rectangular configuration includes a front cover that includes a touch screen. This front cover connects to a back cover to house electronic components such as a memory processor camera power manager battery communication user interface sensors etc. . Example embodiments include custom designing these covers to include images selected by the user user agent HPED and or software application.

The image selector enables a user to design select and place images on the front side and on the back side of the HPED . In the front side of the HPED includes a front side of a front cover a back side of the front cover and a front side of an internal body . In the back side of the HPED includes a front side of a back cover a back side of the back cover and a back side of the internal body .

Looking to the front cover is a display screen and is clear and or translucent. An exterior perimeter of the front cover includes a user selected pattern selected from the image selector . User selected text shown as Property of John is included on the front cover such as being lightly etched in the glass of the display. The front side of the internal body includes electronic components that are beneath the front cover .

Looking to the back cover is made of hard non translucent plastic. The front side and the back side of the back cover include user selected images selected from the image selector . User selected text shown as John 216 228 0589 is included on the back side of the internal body . This back side also includes electronic components such as a camera a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card a speaker a battery and a secure digital SD card . The text on the back side can be included on an electronic component or formed on an exterior surface of a chassis of the HPED.

Different techniques can be used to apply images to a non pliable and or non foldable cover. These techniques include but are not limited to etching or laser etching engraving or laser engraving laminating painting debossing embossing and printing.

Consider an example in which a user buys an HPED at a website of an online store. While at the website the user selects an option to have a custom designed cover for the HPED. The website provides the user with a GUI that enables the user to upload images to a front side of a back cover for the HPED. The user also selects images and patterns for a border around the front cover. Additionally the user writes text to personalize a back side of the internal body with a name and address of the user to signify who owns the HPED. This name and address are permanently engraved in the back side of the internal body. The user also selects other design options such as a specific type of memory and processor for the HPED. A manufacturer of the HPED manufactures the customized HPED and ships it to the user.

Consider an example in which a user decides to replace a front and back cover of an HPED with personalized covers. The user downloads a mobile application to the HPED. This mobile application executes a GUI such as a GUI shown in the figures and the user designs a customized and personalized front and back cover. During the design of the back cover the user takes a picture of herself with the HPED and this picture is applied to the back cover. A third party manufacturer i.e. a manufacturer other than the one that manufactured the HPED applies the user designs to the covers and sends them to the user.

Consider an example in which a user enters a retail store in a shopping mall. The retail stores offers customized covers for HPEDs. A user selects designs from a library and applies these designs to both sides of front and back covers of an HPED. The user removes the covers from the HPED and gives them to the retail store. The retail store has a laser etching machine that applies the designs to the user s covers and gives the covers back to the user. The user then fits the custom designed covers back onto the HPED.

The processor unit includes a processor such as a central processing unit CPU microprocessor application specific integrated circuit ASIC etc. for controlling the overall operation of memory such as random access memory RAM for temporary data storage read only memory ROM for permanent data storage and firmware .
