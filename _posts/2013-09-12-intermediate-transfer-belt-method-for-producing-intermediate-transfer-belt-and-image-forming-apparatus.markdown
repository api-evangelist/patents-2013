The present invention relates to an intermediate transfer belt and a producing method of the intermediate transfer belt and an image forming apparatus.

Conventionally in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus an endless belt seamless belt has been used as a member in a variety of applications. Particularly in full color image forming apparatuses of recent years an intermediate transfer belt system is used in which developed images of four colors yellow magenta cyan and black are superposed on an intermediate transfer belt and then the superposed image is collectively transferred to a recording medium such as paper.

However in such an intermediate transfer belt system four developing devices are used for one photoconductor. Such an intermediate transfer belt system has a disadvantage that printing speed is low. For a system capable of attaining high speed printing a four series tandem system is used in which photoconductors for four colors are arranged in a tandem manner and each color is continuously transferred on paper.

However in this four series tandem system it is quite difficult to achieve sufficient positional accuracy upon superposing respective images because of changes of conditions of paper due to the working environments forming images where the color images are not accurately superposed on top of each other.

Thus recently an intermediate transfer system has been predominately applied in the four series tandem system.

Under such circumstances characteristics required for the intermediate transfer belt have become strict to achieve such as positional accuracy or high speed transfer but it is necessary to satisfy those characteristics.

The intermediate transfer belt has a primary transfer function of receiving a toner from an image bearing member and a secondary transfer function of delivering the toner to paper in both of which transfer rate is needed to be improved. Especially when the transfer rate is low in the secondary transfer residual toner which has not transferred to paper remains on the intermediate transfer belt which tends to cause image failure or filming.

In recent years full color electrophotographic image formation has increasingly been performed on various types of paper such as commonly used smooth paper highly smooth papers with slip properties e.g. coated papers and rough paper e.g. recycled paper embossed paper Japanese paper and kraft paper . Generally the secondary transfer rate in the case of printing to rough paper tends to be lower than that of to plain paper. This is because the intermediate transfer belt cannot completely contact with recessed portions on rough paper so that toner may be insufficiently transferred to paper and remain on the intermediate transfer belt. In order to improve the followability to rough paper various intermediate transfer belts have been proposed which include a base layer and a relatively flexible elastic layer laminated on the base layer.

Generally the elastic layer contains elastic materials such as rubber or elastomer. However there has been an attempt to use softer rubber for the elastic layer in order to improve transferability to rough paper.

When the intermediate transfer belt having the elastic layer which contains the softer rubber is produced and stored a fatty acid such as stearic acid added as lubricant for improving processability at a kneading step of rubber may bloom onto the intermediate transfer belt over time blooming . Especially it has been known that the blooming easily occurs after storing under a high temperature and high humidity environment for a long period followed by under a low temperature environment. When a fatty acid bloomed from the intermediate transfer belt adheres to an image bearing member the image bearing member degenerates to thereby deteriorate image quality which is problematic.

In order to solve the above problem there have been conducted various studies regarding a method for preventing a fatty acid from blooming on the intermediate transfer belt. For example there has been proposed a method in which a surface layer is formed on an elastic layer see Japanese Patent Application Laid Open JP A Nos. 2006 091497 and 2004 198713 .

However in the above proposition in the case where rubber hardness of the elastic layer is low the surface layer is cracked or crinkled when the surface layer having relatively high hardness is formed on the elastic layer which is problematic.

Meanwhile when a surface layer having high flexibility is formed on a soft elastic layer a surface of an intermediate transfer belt is deteriorated in releasability so that toner cannot be efficiently released from the surface and the transfer rate of the toner from the intermediate transfer belt to paper tends to be lowered.

Accordingly there is a need for providing an intermediate transfer belt which can prevent a fatty acid from blooming over time regardless of storage environment of the intermediate transfer belt which allows a stable transfer for a long period and which can achieve high quality images.

The present invention aims to provide an intermediate transfer belt which can prevent a fatty acid from blooming over time regardless of storage environment of the intermediate transfer belt which allows a stable transfer for long period and which can achieve high quality images.

An intermediate transfer belt of the present invention which is a means of solving the above problems is an intermediate transfer belt including a base layer and an elastic layer on the base layer containing spherical particles on a surface thereof and containing an elastic layer ingredient wherein the elastic layer contains a fatty acid in an amount of 0.001 parts by mass to 0.040 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the elastic layer ingredient.

The present invention can solve the above existing problems and achieve the above objects. That is the present invention can provide an intermediate transfer belt which can prevent a fatty acid from blooming over time regardless of storage environment of the intermediate transfer belt which allows a stable transfer for a long period and which can achieve high quality images.

An intermediate transfer belt of the present invention includes a base layer and an elastic layer on the base layer containing spherical particles on a surface thereof preferably consists of the base layer and the elastic layer. More preferably the elastic layer is an outermost layer. That is the intermediate transfer belt particularly preferably does not have a surface layer.

As used herein the term surface layer means an outermost layer covering the entire surface of the elastic layer having a thickness of 1 m or more and containing a composition which mainly contains a resin or an elastomer. Accordingly spherical particles which are present on a surface of the elastic layer and a concavo convex pattern formed by arranging spherical particles are encompassed in the elastic layer that is are not considered as the surface layer.

In the present invention the intermediate transfer belt contains a fatty acid in an amount of 0.001 parts by mass to 0.040 parts by mass preferably 0.005 parts by mass to 0.020 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the elastic layer ingredient. When the amount is more than 0.040 parts by mass a fatty acid may be bloomed over time. When the amount is less than 0.001 parts by mass rubber may become undesirably hard or energizing fatigue may be caused.

As used herein the term elastic layer ingredient means ingredients constituting the elastic layer that is all ingredients contained in the elastic layer such as an elastic material rubber ingredient spherical particles aluminium hydroxide red phosphorus vulcanizing agents vulcanization promoters ion conductive agents or lubricants.

The fatty acid is preferably those being added to the elastic layer as for example lubricants and melting at a rubber kneading temperature. Examples thereof include lauric acid myristic acid palmitic acid and stearic acid.

 1 A prepared intermediate transfer belt is cut into about 1 cm 1 cm and an elastic layer portion is peeled therefrom. The peeled elastic layer portion is weighed and immersed into 6 mL of methanol in a sealed vessel with a cap for 24 hours to extract a fatty acid from the elastic layer of the intermediate transfer belt. 2 To the vessel is added 2 mL of methanol hydrochloride 0.5 mol L followed by sealing the vessel with the cap again and heating at 80 C. for 2 hours in the vessel to thereby methylesterify the fatty acid. Thus an extract of the elastic layer of the intermediate transfer belt can be obtained. 3 The resultant extract is subjected to GC MS measurement.

The GC MS measurement is performed using GC MS2010 product of SHIMADZU CORPORATION in the total ion mode in order to identify the fatty acid contained in the extract to thereby select an ion used. Then the fatty acid is quantified in the SIM selected ion monitor mode.

A standard curve is drawn based on the area of the chromatogram in the SIM mode using a reagent corresponding to the detected fatty acid for example a stearic acid reagent having a purity of 99 or more in the case where stearic acid is detected .

 4 The amount of the fatty acid contained in the extract of the elastic layer of the intermediate transfer belt is determined from the standard curve. Based on the amount the amount of the fatty acid parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the elastic layer ingredient can be calculated.

The amount of the fatty acid contained in the elastic layer of the intermediate transfer belt can be controlled by adjusting a heating temperature and a heating time at a heat treatment step in Method for producing intermediate transfer belt described below.

The base layer preferably contains a resin and an electrical resistance controlling agent more preferably if necessary further contains other ingredients.

The resin is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include fluorine resins such as polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ETFE copolymer polyimide resins and polyamideimide resins. Of these polyimide resins or polyamideimide resins are particularly preferred from the viewpoints of mechanical strength high elasticity and heat resistance. Notably polyimide resins and polyamideimide resins are below described in detail.

The electrical resistance controlling agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include a metal oxide carbon black an ion conductive agent and a conductive polymer. These may be used alone or in combination.

Examples of the metal oxide include zinc oxide tin oxide titanium oxide zirconium oxide aluminum oxide silicon oxide and products obtained by subjecting the above metal oxides to a surface treatment for improving dispersibility thereof.

Examples the carbon black include ketjen black furnace black acetylene black thermal black and gas black.

Examples of the ion conductive agent include tetraalkyl ammonium salts trialkylbenzyl ammonium salts alkylsulfonic acid salts alkylbenzenesulfonic acid salts alkylsulfates glycerin fatty acid esters sorbitan fatty acid esters polyoxyethylenealkylamine esters of polyoxyethylenealiphatic alcohols alkylbetaine and lithium perchlorate.

The electrical resistance controlling agent is preferably added so that the surface resistance thereof is 1 10 sq. to 1 10 sq. and the volume resistance thereof is 1 10 cm to 1 10 cm. However the amount of the electrical resistance controlling agent is too much the base layer become brittle and fragile. Therefore the amount is preferably selected so as not to interfere with mechanical strength. That is in the case of a base layer of the intermediate transfer belt a base layer having a good balance between electrical properties surface resistance and volume resistance and mechanical strength is preferably produced by using a base layer coating liquid containing appropriately adjusted amount of the resin ingredient e.g. polyimide resin precursor or polyamideimide resin precursor and the electrical resistance controlling agent.

The amount of the electrical resistance controlling agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. In the case of carbon black it is preferably 10 by mass to 25 by mass more preferably 15 by mass to 20 by mass relative to the total solid content in the base layer coating liquid. In the case of metal oxides it is preferably 1 by mass to 50 by mass more preferably 10 by mass to 30 by mass relative to the total solid content in the base layer coating liquid. When the amount is below the lower limit electrical resistance may be difficult to be uniform and may be varied greatly relative to any potential. When the amount is above the upper limit the intermediate transfer belt may be deteriorated in mechanical strength.

The base layer coating liquid used for the base layer is prepared by mixing the resin selected from those described above the electrical resistance controlling agent and if necessary additional additives such as dispersing aids reinforcing agents lubricants heat conductive agents or antioxidants. The base layer coating liquid is applied to a support a mold for molding as described below and then subjected to a treatment such as a heat treatment to thereby obtain an endless belt.

The average thickness of the base layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 30 m to 150 m more preferably 40 m to 80 m. When the average thickness is less than 30 m the resultant belt may be fissile. When the average thickness is more than 150 m the resultant belt may be fragile.

The average thickness of the base layer can be measured using a contact type pointer type or eddy current type film thickness meter such as the electric micrometer product of ANRITSU CORPORATION .

The polyimide resin hereinafter may be referred to simply as polyimide and polyamideimide resin hereinafter may be referred to simply as polyamideimide suitably used as a material of the base layer will be now specifically described.

The polyimide is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but aromatic polyimide is preferred. The aromatic polyimides are synthesized via a polyamic acid polyimide precursor which is obtained by reacting a commonly known aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride or a derivative thereof with a commonly known aromatic diamine. The polyimide in particular aromatic polyimide has a stiff main chain and therefore is insoluble in a solvent and is not melted. Thus in the above synthesis method for the polyimide resin at first an aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride is reacted with an aromatic diamine so as to synthesize a polyimide precursor i.e. a polyamic acid or polyamide acid which is soluble in an organic solvent. The thus synthesized polyimide precursor is molded by various methods followed by dehydration cyclization i.e. imidization upon application of heat thereto or using a chemical method to thereby synthesize a polyimide resin. Taking as an example a reaction for obtaining the aromatic polyimide the outline thereof is shown in the following Reaction Scheme 1 .

In Reaction Scheme 1 Ardenotes a tetravalent aromatic residue containing at least one six membered carbon ring and Ardenotes a divalent aromatic residue containing at least one six membered carbon ring. Also molecular ends in the Reaction Scheme are hydrogen atoms.

The aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include ethylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride cyclopentanetetracarboxylic dianhydride pyromellitic dianhydride 3 3 4 4 benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride 2 2 3 3 benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride 3 3 4 4 biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride 2 2 3 3 biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride 2 2 bis 2 3 dicarboxyphenyl propane dianhydride bis 3 4 dicarboxyphenyl ether dianhydride bis 3 4 dicarboxyphenyl sulfone dianhydride 1 1 bis 2 3 dicarboxyphenyl ethane dianhydride bis 2 3 dicarboxyphenyl methane dianhydride bis 3 4 dicarboxyphenyl methane dianhydride 2 2 bis 3 4 dicarboxyphenyl 1 1 1 3 3 3 hexafluoropropane dianhydride 2 3 6 7 naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride 1 4 5 8 naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride 1 2 5 6 naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride 1 2 3 4 benzenetetracarboxylic dianhydride 3 4 9 10 perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride 2 3 6 7 anthracenetetracarboxylic dianhydride and 1 2 7 8 phenanthrenetetracarboxylic dianhydride. These may be used alone or in combination.

The aromatic diamine which reacts with the aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include m phenylenediamine o phenylenediamine p phenylenediamine m aminobenzylamine p aminobenzylamine 4 4 diaminodiphenyl ether 3 3 diaminodiphenyl ether 3 4 diaminodiphenyl ether bis 3 aminophenyl sulfide 3 aminophenyl 4 aminophenyl sulfide bis 4 aminophenyl sulfide bis 3 aminophenyl sulfide 3 aminophenyl 4 aminophenyl sulfoxide bis 3 aminophenyl sulfone 3 aminophenyl 4 aminophenyl sulfone bis 4 aminophenyl sulfone 3 3 diaminobenzophenone 3 4 diaminobenzophenone 4 4 diaminobenzophenone 3 3 diaminodiphenylmethane 3 4 diaminodiphenylmethane 4 4 diaminodiphenylmethane bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl methane bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl methane 1 1 bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl ethane 1 1 bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl ethane 1 2 bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl ethane 1 2 bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl ethane 2 2 bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl propane 2 2 bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl propane 2 2 bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl butane 2 2 bis 3 3 aminophenoxy phenyl 1 1 1 3 3 3 hexafluoropropane 2 2 bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl 1 1 1 3 3 3 hexafluoropropane 1 3 bis 3 aminophenoxy benzene 1 3 bis 4 aminophenoxy benzene 1 4 bis 3 aminophenoxy benzene 1 4 bis 4 aminophenoxy benzene 4 4 bis 3 aminophenoxy biphenyl 4 4 bis 4 aminophenoxy biphenyl bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl ketone bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl ketone bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl sulfide bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl sulfide bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl sulfoxide bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl sulfoxide bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl sulfone bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl sulfone bis 4 3 aminophenoxy phenyl ether bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenyl ether 1 4 bis 4 3 aminophenoxy benzoyl benzene 1 3 bis 4 3 aminophenoxy benzoyl benzene 4 4 bis 3 4 aminophenoxy benzoyl diphenyl ether 4 4 bis 3 3 aminophenoxy benzoyl diphenyl ether 4 4 bis 4 4 amino dimethylbenzyl phenoxy benzophenone 4 4 bis 4 4 amino dimethylbenzyl phenoxy diphenyl sulfone bis 4 4 4 aminophenoxy phenoxyphenyl sulfone 1 4 bis 4 4 aminophenoxy phenoxy dimethylbenzyl benzene and 1 3 bis 4 4 aminophenoxy dimethylbenzyl benzene. These may be used alone or in combination. Of these at least 4 4 diaminodiphenyl ether is preferably used as one ingredient.

A polyimide precursor polyamic acid can be obtained by polymerizing approximately equimolar amounts of the aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride and the diamine in an organic polar solvent. Hereinafter a production method of polyamic acid will be explained in detail.

Notably the organic polar solvent used in the polymerization reaction of polyamic acid is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose as long as it dissolves polyamic acid. Examples thereof include sulfoxide solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide and diethylsulfoxide formamide solvents such as N N dimethylformamide and N N diethylformamide acetamide solvents such as N N dimethylacetamide and N N diethylacetamide pyrrolidone solvents such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidone and N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone phenol solvents such as phenol o m or p cresol xylenol halogenated phenol and catechol ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran dioxane and dioxolane alcohol solvents such as methanol ethanol and butanol cellosolve solvents such as butyl cellosolve or hexamethylphosphoramide and butyrolactone. These may be used alone or in combination. Of these N N dimethylacetamide and N methyl 2 pyrrolidone are particularly preferred.

One employable method for producing the polyimide precursor is as follows. Firstly in an inert gas such as argon gas and nitrogen gas environment one or more diamines are dissolved or dispersed into a slurry in the organic solvent. To the resultant solution or slurry is added at least one aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride or a derivative thereof which may be in the form of solid solution in which it is dissolved in the organic solvent or slurry so that a ring opening polymerization addition reaction involving heat generation is induced and as a result the viscosity of the solution or slurry rapidly increases to thereby produce a high molecular weight polyamic acid solution. The reaction temperature is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. It is preferably 20 C. to 100 C. more preferably 60 C. or lower. The reaction time is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. It is preferably about 30 min to about 12 hours.

The method for producing the polyimide precursor is only one example and the additions may be performed with the order reversed. That is the aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride or a derivative thereof may be firstly dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent and then the diamine may be added thereto. The diamine may be added in the form of solid solution in which it is dissolved in the organic polar solvent or slurry. Accordingly the order of mixing acid dianhydrides and diamines is not limited. Further aromatic tetracarboxylic dianhydrides and aromatic diamines may be added to the organic polar solvent simultaneously to thereby allow to react.

As described above a polyimide precursor solution containing polyamic acid uniformly dissolved in an organic polar solvent can be obtained by polymerizing an aromatic polycarboxylic anhydride or a derivative thereof and an aromatic diamine at about equimolar in the organic polar solvent.

The polyimide precursor solution polyamic acid solution may be those synthesized as described above. However a commercially available product of a so called polyimide varnish in which a polyamic acid composition is dissolved in an organic solvent can be used. Examples thereof include TORENEES product of Toray Industries INC. U VARNISH product of Ube Industries Ltd. RIKA COAT product of New Japan Chemical Co. Ltd. OPTOMER product of JSR Corporation SE812 product of Nissan Chemical Industries Ltd. and CRC8000 product of Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Ltd. .

A filler is optionally mixed with or dispersed in the polyamic acid solution to thereby prepare a coating liquid used for forming the base layer and the resultant coating solution is applied to a support a mold for molding followed by heating to thereby convert the polyamic acid polyimide precursor to a polyimide imidization .

The heating method 1 is a method in which a polyamic acid is heated at 200 C. to 350 C. to thereby convert to a polyimide. This is a simple and practical method for obtaining a polyimide polyimide resin .

The chemical method 2 is a method in which a polyamic acid is allowed to react with a dehydration ring forming reagent e.g. a mixture of a carboxylic anhydride and a tertiary amine and then heating so as to complete imidization. This method is more complex and expensive compared to the heating method 1 . Therefore the heating method 1 has been usually employed.

Notably in order to obtain intrinsic properties of polyimide i.e. durability mechanical strength and heat resistance the polyamic acid is preferably heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the glass transition temperature of a resultant polyimide so as to complete imidization.

The progress of the imidization the degree of the imidization can be determined by a conventionally used measurement method for imidization ratio.

Examples of the measurement method for imidization ratio include a nuclear magnetic resonance NMR method in which the imidization ratio is determined on the basis of an integral ratio of H of the amide group observed at about 9 ppm to about 11 ppm to H of the aromatic ring observed at about 6 ppm to about 9 ppm a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometric FT IR method a method of quantifying water formed as a result of ring formation of imides and a method in which the amount of carboxylic acid is determined by a neutralization titration method.

In the Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometric FT IR method the imidization ratio is for example defined as in the following Equation a . In the Equation a A denotes an amount by mole of the imide group determined in the heating step i.e. the imidization step and B denotes an amount by mole of the imide group when the polyamic acid is completely 100 imidized theoretical value . Imidization ratio 100 a 

An amount by mole of the imide group in this definition can be determined from the absorbance ratios of the characteristic absorption of the imide group measured by the FT IR method. For example imidization ratio may be determined using the following absorbance ratios as representative characteristic absorptions.

 1 a ratio of the absorbance at 725 cmwhich is attributed to an imide caused by the bending vibration of the C O group of an imide ring to the absorbance at 1 015 cmwhich is attributed to a benzene ring 

 2 a ratio of the absorbance at 1 380 cmwhich is attributed to an imide caused by the bending vibration of the C N group of an imide ring to the absorbance at 1 500 cmwhich is attributed to a benzene ring 

 3 a ratio of the absorbance at 1 720 cmwhich is attributed to an imide caused by the bending vibration of the C O group of an imide ring to the absorbance at 1 500 cmwhich is attributed to a benzene ring and

 4 a ratio of the absorbance at 1 720 cmwhich is attributed to an imide to the absorbance at 1 670 cmwhich is attributed to an amide group the interaction of the bending vibration of a N H group and the stretching vibration of a C N group of an amide group .

Alternatively when it is confirmed that the multiple absorption bands attributed to an amide group at 3 000 cmto 3 300 cmhave disappeared the reliability of completion of the imidization is further enhanced.

The polyamideimide is a resin containing in the molecular skeleton thereof both an imide group which is rigid and an amide group which imparts flexibility to the resin. The polyamideimide used in the present invention may be those having a generally known structure.

Examples of common methods for synthesizing the polyamideimide resin include an acid chloride method a a known method in which a halide compound of which the most representative example is chloride compound derived from a trivalent carboxylic acid having an acid anhydride group is reacted in a solvent with a diamine to thereby produce a polyamideimide resin see for example Japanese Patent Application Publication JP B No. 42 15637 and a isocyanate method b a known method in which a trivalent derivative having an acid anhydride group and a carboxylic acid is reacted in a solvent with an aromatic polyisocyanate to thereby produce a polyimideamide resin see for example JP B No. 44 19274 both of which may be used. Each of the above methods now will be explained.

These may be used alone or in combination. Of these N N dimethylacetamide and N methyl 2 pyrrolidone are particularly preferred.

The polyamic acid is converted imidized to a polyimide by applying the resultant polyamide polyamic acid solution to a support a mold for molding followed by heating.

Examples thereof include 4 4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate tolylene diisocyanate xylylene diisocyanate 4 4 diphenylether diisocyanate 4 4 2 2 bis 4 phenoxyphenyl propane diisocyanate biphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate biphenyl 3 3 diisocyanate biphenyl 3 4 diisocyanate 3 3 dimethylbiphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate 2 2 dimethylbiphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate 3 3 diethylbiphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate 2 2 diethylbiphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate 3 3 dimethoxybiphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate 2 2 dimethoxybiphenyl 4 4 diisocyanate naphthalene 1 5 diisocyanate and naphthalene 2 6 diisocyanate.

The polyamideimide precursor is converted to a polyamideimide by applying to a support a solution containing the polyamideimide precursor in which the compound derived from a trivalent carboxylic acid having an acid anhydride group and the aromatic polyisocyanate are dissolved in an organic polar solvent followed by heating. In this method the polyamideimide precursor is directly converted to the polyamideimide without via polyamic acid with carbon dioxide being generated. As one example of the conversion in the case where trimellitic anhydride and an aromatic isocyanate are used is shown in the following Reaction Scheme 6 .

The polyimide and polyamideimide are usually used alone but may be used in combination with those selected considering compatibility therewith. Also a copolymer having a polyimide repeat unit and a polyamideimide repeat unit may be used.

The elastic layer contains spherical particles on a surface thereof and contains an elastic layer ingredient.

The elastic layer refers to a layer which has a microrubber hardness of 90 or less under a environment of 25 C. and 50 RH. The microrubber hardness may be measured by a commercially available microrubber hardness meter such as MD 1 product of KOBUNSHI KEIKI CO. LTD. .

The elastic layer ingredient refers to ingredients constituting the elastic layer that is all ingredients contained in the elastic layer such as an elastic material rubber ingredient spherical particles aluminium hydroxide red phosphorus vulcanizing agents vulcanization promoters ion conductive agents or lubricants.

The elastic material is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include elastomer or rubber.

The elastomer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include thermoplastic elastomers and thermosetting elastomers. These may be used alone or in combination.

The thermoplastic elastomer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include polyester elastomers polyamide elastomers polyether elastomers polyurethane elastomers polyolefin elastomers polystyrene elastomers polyacrylic elastomers polydiene elastomers silicone modified polycarbonate elastomers and fluorine copolymer elastomers.

The thermosetting elastomer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include polyurethane elastomers silicone modified epoxy elastomers and silicone modified acrylic elastomers.

The rubber is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include isoprene rubbers styrene rubbers butadiene rubbers nitrile rubbers hydrogenated nitrile rubbers ethylenepropylene rubbers butyl rubbers silicone rubber chloroprene rubbers acrylic rubbers chlorosulfonated polyethylenes fluorine rubbers urethane rubbers hydrin rubbers acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers and vulcanized rubbers. These may be used alone or in combination. Of these acrylic rubbers and hydrogenated nitrile rubbers are preferred from the viewpoint of being capable of obtaining properties which are required for followability to paper such as hardness elastic modulus or creep property.

The elastic layer contains spherical particles on a surface thereof. The spherical particles are embedded in at least a part of a surface of the elastic layer. The spherical particles may be partially exposed.

The surface of the elastic layer preferably has a concavo convex pattern formed by arranging the spherical particles in a plane direction from the viewpoint of transferability to paper.

The arrangement of the spherical particles is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include an arrangement in which the spherical particles are arranged on the elastic layer to form a single layer in the thickness direction and an arrangement in which two or more of the spherical particles are stacked on top of each other in the thickness direction.

Of these preferred is an arrangement in which the spherical particles are arranged on the elastic layer to form a single layer in the thickness direction. This is because the arrangement can easily be attained by directly applying the spherical particles on the elastic layer and leveling the spherical particles to thereby uniformly arrange the spherical particles. In addition the arrangement can stably form high quality images.

Meanwhile in the arrangement in which two or more of the spherical particles are stacked on top of each other in the thickness direction the spherical particles are ununiformly distributed. As a result due to the electrical resistance of the spherical particles electrical characteristics on a surface of the intermediate transfer belt also become ununiform potentially leading to image failures. Specifically the electrical resistance becomes high in a region where a large amount of the spherical particles Yes and surface potential is generated in this region due to residual charges. This makes the surface potential ununiform on the intermediate transfer belt surface to thereby cause the difference in image density between this region and the neighboring regions resulting in that image failures may be visualized.

The spherical particles are not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include spherical particles mainly containing a rubber or a resin e.g. acrylic resin melamine resin polyamide resin polyester resin silicone resin and fluorine resin hollow or porous spherical particles obtained by subjecting the above spherical particles to a surface treatment with different materials spherical particles obtained by coating with a hard resin the surfaces of the particles made of a rubber material and spherical silicone resin particles or spherical fluorine resin particles produced by controlling their shape upon a polymerization.

Of these preferred are spherical silicone resin particles or spherical fluorine resin particles produced by controlling their shape upon a polymerization because they have lubricity and thus can impart to the resultant intermediate transfer belt high releaseability to toner particles and high abrasion resistance. The spherical particles are preferably spherical to the greatest extent possible.

The spherical particles refer to particles which have an average particle diameter of 100 m or less which have a truly spherical shape which do not dissolve in an organic solvent and in which the temperature at which 3 thereof thermally decompose is 200 C. or higher.

The spherical particles are not particularly limited and may be an appropriately synthesized product or a commercially available product. Examples of the commercially available product include silicone particles product of Momentive Performance Materials Inc. trade names TOSPEARL 120 TOSPEARL 145 or TOSPEARL 2000B and acryl particles product of SEKISUI PLASTICS CO. LTD. trade name TECHNO POLYMER MBX SS .

The volume average particle diameter can be measured by commercially available particle size analyzers such as NANOTRAC UPA 150EX product of NIKKISO CO. LTD. .

Examples of the elastic layer ingredient include in addition to the elastic material and the spherical particles lubricants electrical resistance controlling agents flame retardants for imparting flame retardancy antioxidants reinforcing agents fillers and vulcanization promoters.

The lubricant is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but preferably is a fatty acid. The fatty acid may be those described above.

The electrical resistance controlling agent is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. However because carbon black and metal oxides impair flexibility of the resultant product the amounts of them are preferably lowered. Preferably ion conductive agents or conductive polymers are used.

The average thickness of the elastic layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. It is preferably 50 m to 1 000 m more preferably 100 m to 500 m. When the average thickness of the elastic layer is smaller than 50 m the followability to surface irregularities of a recording medium such as paper and the transfer pressure reducing effect may be lowered. When the average thickness of the elastic layer exceeds 1 000 m the film becomes heavier. As a result the film may easily be warped and unstable in running. Further cracks tend to occur at part of the belt which is curved so as to be wound around the rollers in a stretched manner.

The average thickness is an average value of thicknesses measured at any 10 points. Notably the thickness may be measured by observing a cross sectional surface of an intermediate transfer belt under a scanning electron microscope VE 7800 product of KEYENCE CORPORATION .

The electrical resistance of the elastic layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. For example the electrical resistance of the elastic layer is preferably 1 10 sq. to 1 10 sq. as surface resistance and 1 10 cm to 1 10 cm as volume resistance.

The method for forming the elastic layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include a method in which the elastic layer is formed on the base layer through for example injection molding or extrusion molding and a method in which an elastic layer coating liquid containing the elastic layer ingredient is applied onto the base layer to form the elastic layer. The above methods will be described in detail in Method for producing intermediate transfer belt.

Example of a method for forming a surface of the elastic layer includes a method in which the spherical particles are applied onto the elastic layer of the belt obtained by laminating the elastic layer on the base layer using the method for forming the elastic layer to thereby form a uniform concavo convex pattern on a surface of the elastic layer followed by heating and curing at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time while being rotated. The above method will be described in detail in Method for producing intermediate transfer belt.

The microrubber hardness of the intermediate transfer belt is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose but is preferably 60 or less more preferably 20 to 40 from the viewpoints of followability to paper and deformability of the belt.

The microrubber hardness may be measured by for example a microrubber hardness meter MD 1 product of KOBUNSHI KEIKI CO. LTD. .

The intermediate transfer belt is preferably an endless belt i.e. a seamless belt. The circumference of the intermediate transfer belt in the case where the intermediate transfer belt is an endless belt is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. However it is preferably 1 000 mm or more more preferably 1 100 mm to 3 000 mm.

A method for producing an intermediate transfer belt of the present invention is a method for producing the intermediate transfer belt of the present invention and includes at least an elastic layer forming step and a heat treatment step and preferably a base layer forming step and if necessary further includes other steps.

The base layer forming step is a step of forming a base layer using a base layer coating liquid. It is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Example thereof includes a method exemplified in the description regarding the base layer.

The elastic layer forming step is a step of forming an elastic layer containing spherical particles on a surface thereof by applying onto a base layer an elastic layer coating liquid containing an elastic layer ingredient and then arranging spherical particles thereon. It includes the following elastic layer forming treatment and elastic layer surface forming treatment.

The elastic layer forming treatment is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include a method in which the elastic layer is formed on the base layer through for example injection molding or extrusion molding and a method in which an elastic layer coating liquid containing the elastic layer ingredient is applied onto the base layer to form the elastic layer.

While the endless base layer in which a cylindrical metal mold is inserted is being slowly rotated a coating liquid containing an elastic layer ingredient is uniformly coated or flow cast on the entire outer surface of the cylindrical metal mold with a liquid supplying device such as a nozzle or a dispenser to thereby form a coat film . Then the rotation speed is increased to a predetermined value at which the rotation speed is maintained constant for a desired period. Thereafter the resultant film is sufficiently leveled to form an elastic layer. Notably if necessary heating may be performed during the rotation.

Example of the elastic layer surface forming treatment includes a method in which the spherical particles are applied onto the elastic layer of the intermediate transfer belt obtained by laminating the elastic layer on the base layer using the elastic layer forming treatment to thereby form a uniform concavo convex pattern on a surface of the elastic layer followed by heating and curing at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time while being rotated.

As shown in after a powder supplying device and a press member have been set spherical particles are uniformly applied onto the elastic layer surface from the powder supplying device while being rotated. Then the press member is pressed against the thus applied spherical particles on the elastic layer surface at a constant pressure. Pressing by the press member embeds the spherical particles in the elastic layer of a belt obtained by laminating the elastic layer on the base layer which has been formed on a metal drum while removing the extra spherical particles to thereby form a uniform concavo convex pattern on a surface of the elastic layer. The resultant is heated and cured at a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time while being rotated.

When the spherical particles used for forming the elastic layer having a concavo convex pattern on a surface thereof are monodispersed spherical particles a uniform particle monolayer can be formed through only such a leveling step using the press member.

The heat treatment step is a step of vulcanizing the elastic layer and then heating. Notably the heat treatment may be referred to as a post cure treatment.

A heating condition in the heat treatment step is not particularly limited and may be appropriately adjusted considering the type of an elastic layer ingredient and a weight loss of a fatty acid. The heating is preferably performed under any of the following conditions at 150 C. or more but less than 155 C. for 8 hours or more at 155 C. or more but less than 165 C. for 5 hours or more at 165 C. or more but less than 175 C. for 4 hours or more and at 175 C. to 180 C. for 3 hours or more which may adjust the amount of a fatty acid contained in an intermediate transfer belt so as to fall within a range of 0.001 parts by mass to 0.040 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the elastic layer ingredient.

Notably the heat treatment step is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected but is preferably performed in the air using driers such as hot air circulating driers.

The fatty acid contained in the elastic layer is volatilized and eliminated from the elastic layer by heating but excessive heating causes a decrease of rubber elasticity and a deterioration of energizing fatigue which have a great effect on image quality. Therefore a heating temperature and a heating time should be well considered.

A heating condition in the heat treatment step is not particularly limited and may be appropriately adjusted considering the type of an elastic layer ingredient and a weight loss of a fatty acid. The heating is preferably performed under any of the following conditions at 150 C. or more but less than 155 C. for 8 hours or more at 155 C. or more but less than 165 C. for 5 hours or more at 165 C. or more but less than 175 C. for 4 hours or more and at 175 C. to 180 C. for 3 hours or more which may adjust the amount of a fatty acid contained in an intermediate transfer belt so as to 0.020 parts by mass or less relative to 100 parts by mass of the elastic layer ingredient.

Notably the heat treatment step is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected but is preferably performed in the air using driers such as hot air circulating driers.

In this layer construction shown in a flexible elastic layer is formed on a relatively flexible but rigid base layer and a concavo convex pattern is formed on the elastic layer by partially embedding spherical particles in the elastic layer .

A surface pattern of the elastic layer is a concavo convex pattern in which the spherical particles are arranged on the elastic layer to form a single layer in a plane direction.

The image forming apparatus shown in is one exemplary schematic view of essential parts for describing an image forming apparatus in which a plurality of photoconductor drums are serially arranged along an intermediate transfer belt.

This figure shows one exemplary configuration of a four drum digital color printer having four photoconductor drums Bk Y M and C for forming toner images of four different colors black yellow magenta and cyan .

In main body of a printer is composed of image writing sections image forming sections and paper feeding sections for electrophotographic color image formation. Based on image signals image processing operation is performed in an image processing section and converted to color signals of black Bk magenta M yellow Y and cyan C for image formation and then the color signals are transmitted to the image writing sections .

Each of the developing units Bk M Y and C employs a two component magnet brush developing method. A belt constitution section is located between intermediate rollers Bk M Y and C. The color toner images formed on the photoconductors are sequentially superposingly transferred.

The transfer paper P fed from the paper feeding section is fed via a registration roller and then held by a transfer conveyance belt as a belt constitution section. The toner images transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt are secondarily transferred collectively transferred to the transfer paper P by a secondary transfer bias roller serving as a secondary transfer unit at a point in which the intermediate transfer belt is brought into contact with the transfer conveyance belt . Thus a color image is formed on the transfer paper P. The transfer paper P on which the color image is formed is fed to a fixing unit via the transfer conveyance belt and the color image is fixed on the transfer paper P by the fixing unit and then the transfer paper P is discharged from the main body of the printer.

The lubricant applying unit includes a solid lubricant and a conductive brush configured to rub the intermediate transfer belt so as to apply the solid lubricant to the surface of the intermediate transfer belt. The conductive brush is constantly in contact with the intermediate transfer belt so as to apply the solid lubricant to the intermediate transfer belt . The solid lubricant is effective to improve the cleanability of the intermediate transfer belt thereby preventing occurrence of filming thereon and improving durability of the intermediate transfer belt.

Examples of the lubricant include zinc stearate calcium stearate zinc palmitate zinc laurate stearic acid palmitic acid and lauric acid. Of these particularly preferred is zinc stearate.

Notably the intermediate transfer belt of the present invention can be suitably applied to an image forming apparatus employing an intermediate transfer belt system which includes the above described intermediate transfer belt as well as an image forming apparatus employing a transfer conveyance belt system which includes a transfer conveyance belt instead of the intermediate transfer belt . The image forming apparatus employing the transfer conveyance belt system can employ both of the one photoconductor drum system and the four photoconductor drum system.

Thus an extract of the elastic layer of the intermediate transfer belt was obtained. 3 The resultant extract was objected to GC MS measurement.

The GC MS measurement was performed using GC MS2010 product of SHIMADZU CORPORATION in the total ion mode in order to identify the fatty acid contained in the extract to thereby select an ion used. Then the fatty acid was quantified in the SIM selected ion monitor mode.

A standard curve was drawn based on the area of the chromatogram in the SIM mode using a reagent corresponding to the detected fatty acid a reagent of stearic acid lauric acid myristic acid or palmitic acid having a purity of 99 or more .

 4 The amount of the fatty acid contained in the extract of the elastic layer of the intermediate transfer belt was determined from the standard curve. Based on the amount the amount of the fatty acid parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the elastic layer ingredient was calculated. 

Each of the produced intermediate transfer belts was cut into 10 cm 10 cm stored at 45 C. and 90 RH for 1 day and then immersed into water at 23 C. for 3 days follower by visually observing for the presence or absence of occurrence of a fatty acid blooming on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt and evaluating according to the following criteria. Notably when a fatty acid blooming is occurred white deposit is visually observed.

Each of the produced intermediate transfer belts was mounted on the image forming apparatus shown in and evaluated as follows. Results are shown in Tables 1 1 to 1 4. The toner used for the image evaluation was a toner for IMAGIO MP C5002 product of Ricoh Company Ltd. .

The transfer paper used was paper having irregularities in its surface LEATHAC 66 215 kg paper . A solid blue image Test Chart No. 5 1 from The Imaging Society of Japan was output on the transfer paper using the image forming apparatus.
