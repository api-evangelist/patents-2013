title: System and method for service advertising and discovery
abstract: A centralised identity and capability resolution server (ICRS) keeps track of which user or subscriber is logged in on every device in a communications ecosystem and maintains the state of user, device and service relationships based on multiple external events. Each subscriber is provided with a unique identifier within the ecosystem or unique ecosystem identifier. The ICRS establishes an association between the service identifier, user and particular device that a user is using for that service. The devices within the ecosystem are configured to inform the ICRS of new accounts, or changes affecting existing accounts, such as cancelling of an account or loss of device. In that way, the ICRS has up to date state of the relationships between user or subscriber identifiers, devices, and various service identifiers. This enables ICRS to retrieve any identifier associated to the subscriber when any other identifier belonging to the user is provided.

A centralised identity and capability resolution server keeps track of which user or subscriber is logged in on every device in a communications ecosystem and maintains the state of user device relationship based on multiple external events e.g. login device wipe carrier actions etc. . Each subscriber is provided with a unique identifier within the ecosytem. This identifier will be referred to within this disclosure as a unique ecosystem identifier. A communications ecosystem comprises one or more wireless or wired networks one or more electronic devices operating within one of the networks one or more services provided over at least one of the networks and subscribers. In some embodiments the ecosystem also includes servers which perform functions including but not limited to providing services and managing devices and subscribers and their relationships. The services provided within the ecosystem may comprise communication or social media services. Each communication social media service client is provided with a service identifier for the respective service. The centralised identity and capability resolution server establishes an association between the service identifier user and particular device that a user is using for that service. The devices within the ecosystem are configured to inform the centralised identity and capability resolution server of new accounts or changes affecting existing accounts such as cancelling of an account or conditions which may indicate a loss of device. In that way the centralised identity resolution server has up to date state of the relationships between user or subscriber identifiers devices and various service identifiers. This enables the centralised identity and capability resolution server to retrieve any identifier associated to the subscriber when any other identifier belonging to the user is provided.

Embodiments of the centralised identity and capability resolution server dynamically adjust relationships between user subscriber device and service e.g. Facebook . If a device is lost stolen wiped or changes owner then the centralised identity and capability resolution server may notify the service providers such as BBM Push Server Facebook etc of that fact. In some embodiments the centralised identity resolution server is also a mechanism for social media discovery and integration.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile electronic devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

A centralised identity and capability resolution server ICRS is located within the network . The centralised ICRS will be described in more detail with reference to . In the embodiment shown in the centralised ICRS tracks the device identifiers of the mobile devices the computer and the users of those devices. Additionally it tracks the services and accounts accessed by each of the users of those devices and cross references the device identifiers account identifiers and service identifiers with an ecosystem identifier unique to the user within the ecosystem.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile electronic devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile electronic devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile electronic devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The wireless connector system manages communications including email messages to and from a set of managed mobile electronic devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile electronic devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile electronic devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email messaging server having a global address book and optionally other servers . The other servers may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile electronic devices in the wireless network an authentication server and an application server for implementing server based applications.

The global address book comprises electronic contact records generated and maintained by an IT information technology administrator of the network . Typically the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server and there is no local copy on the mobile electronic device . In addition the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network e.g. enterprise . The contact records in the global address book may be one or more of individual contact records or user records or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual users .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile electronic devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile electronic devices are encrypted. In some embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile electronic device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server other servers or application servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or other servers to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile electronic device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile electronic device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server other servers and application server . Some embodiments of the application servers provide communications services. Some embodiments of the applications servers provide social networking services.

In some embodiments the mobile electronic device also includes a removable memory card or module typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile electronic device via the memory card which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile electronic device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile electronic device also stores other data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile electronic device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile electronic device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile electronic device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The mobile electronic device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile electronic device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices.

A user of the mobile electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile electronic device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the phone application and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The phone application can be split into multiple applications or sub modules for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface API . It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the mobile electronic device while continuing to fall within the term phone application .

Referring to a centralised identity and capability resolution server will be described. The server is for use in a communications ecosystem the communications ecosystem comprising one or more electronic devices such as but not limited to mobile electronic device operating within one or more communication networks. The centralised identity and capability resolution server includes a memory a communication interface and a processor . In some embodiments the centralised identity and capability resolution server comprises one server. In other embodiments the centralised identity and capability resolution server is implemented in a virtualized environment. Thus although depicted as one block in the centralised identity and capability resolution server can be implemented across a number of devices in a cloud environment. The memory has a database of unique ecosystem identifiers for subscribers within a communications ecosystem stored thereon. In some embodiments the database is stored remotely from the server. Each entry in the database is for a unique ecosystem identifier comprising account information associated with the unique ecosystem identifier. In a non limiting embodiment the unique ecosystem identifier is a GUID Global Unique Identifier . In some embodiments the unique ecosystem identifier is assigned once to a user and stays with the user indefinitely regardless of change of network provider or change of device. In some embodiments the database entry for the unique ecosystem identifier includes links or relationships that point to other identifiers associated with the subscriber for that ecosystem identifier. Non limiting examples of the other identifiers include device identifiers and service identifiers.

The communication interface for communicating with devices within the communications ecosystem. For example notifications and queries from devices or service providers within the ecosystem are received at the server through the communication interface . Responses to queries are sent through the communication interface. Non limiting examples of the communication interface include a receiver a transmitter a transceiver and an antenna.

The processor is configured to upon receiving notification through the communication interface of a new subscriber in the ecosystem create a new database entry for a unique ecosystem identifier in the database for the new subscriber. The processor is also configured to upon receiving notification of any account information associated with the new subscriber enter the account information into the database entry. In some embodiments an initial state of a relationship between the unique ecosystem identifier and account information is entered into the database entry.

In some embodiments the processor is further configured to notify a service provider of a change in the database affecting an account with the service provider. Non limiting examples of the account information include a device identifier an account identifier for service such as a social media service an account identifier for a wireless network service change in status of an account change in status of a device change in ownership of a device change in status of a service. Non limiting examples of services include Facebook Scoreloop Twitter LinkedIn BBM Internet service and wireless network service.

In some embodiments the processor is further configured to receive through the communication interface a request from a device within the ecosystem for information associated with another subscriber within the ecosystem. In some embodiments the devices are configured to make the request from within another application running on the device. For example while using Facebook a request to communicate with a Facebook friend using BBM can be made without exiting Facebook or opening BBM. The centralised identity and capability resolution server will process the request by determining the ecosystem identifier for the other subscriber and using the ecosystem identifier to determine if the information requested is available in the database. For example if the information requested is a BBM address the server will determine if there is a BBM account associated with the ecosystem identifier for the other subscriber. In some embodiments the server will send a notice to the other subscriber of the request. In some embodiments the notice will include an invitation to communicate with the subscriber or an invitation to register for a service.

In some embodiments the processor is further configured to provide the device with the information associated with the other subscriber.

In some embodiments the processor is configured to notify certain subscribers of particular changes in the status of a subscriber. For example if a device is disabled e.g. lost or subscription with carrier ceased subscribers identified as friends of the owner of the device could be notified that the owner in not reachable by that device. In another example a server can be notified not to deliver messages to a disabled device.

In some embodiments the centralised identity and capability resolution server provides information based on explicit relationships between subscribers devices or services or based on inferred relationships between subscribers devices or services. In one example a trusted relationship is inferred between multiple devices for a single subscriber. In another example for a peer to peer service if a change in relationship occurs between a service and a device all devices of the subscriber are notified of the change. Alternatively if a friend or trusted relationship is established between subscribers notification of a change such as the addition and activation of a new device by one subscriber is provided to the second subscriber and one or more devices associated with the second subscriber.

In some embodiments the processor is configured to enforce service policies for services offered in the ecosystem. For example there may be policies associated with a vendor account such as only certain credit cards can be used a limit on the amount that can be purchased etc. In another example a user can be logged in or authenticated on a maximum number of devices at one time. In another example access to a service can be blocked depending on time of day location maximum time limits or other criteria.

A particular embodiment of a centralised identity and capability resolution server will now be described with reference to which shows an identity and capability resolution server ICRS in communication with an ICRS database mobile devices and other devices . In this case the database is remote from the server. As mentioned above with reference to the database can in some embodiments be located in a memory on the server.

The ICRS comprise an orchestrator that interacts with various components of the server. The orchestrator is an example embodiment of the processor described with reference to . The orchestrator sends associations get commands and association updates to the database through a cache memory . Nonlimiting examples of the cache memory include a L2 cache or a JPA Java Persistence API . Through a notifications module the orchestrator sends notifications related to the relationships to the mobile device and the other electronic devices . The notifications module in some embodiments is part of a communications interface such as the one described with reference to . The orchestrator also receives get and set commands from the mobile device and the other devices . At the ICRS the get and set commands are received by a REST Representational State Transfer API which comprises a Set API and a Get API . In some embodiments the REST API is part of a communications interface such as the one described with reference to .

In another embodiment as illustrated in the ICRS does not include an orchestrator and association gets and association updates are provided directly from the REST API . The notifications module receives information from the state management module and sends notifications related to the relationships to the mobile device and the other electronic devices .

The servers have been described as operating in an ecosystem. Referring to a communications ecosystem will now be described. The communications ecosystem includes one or more networks one or more electronic devices and a centralised identity and capability resolution server . Each registered electronic device is registered for service over at least one of the one or more networks .

At least one of the electronic devices is configured to notify the centralised identity and capability resolution server of any change in account information for services accessed by the at least one of the electronic devices . At least one of the networks is configured to notify the centralised identity and capability resolution server of any changes in account information within the at least one of the networks.

In some embodiment the centralised identity and capability resolution server is configured to receive account information from at least one social media service for subscribers within the ecosystem.

Referring now to a method of resolving capabilities and identities within a communications ecosystem will be described. The method starts with the action of receiving notification at a centralised identity and capability resolution server of a new subscriber in the ecosystem. At action a new database entry for a unique ecosystem identifier in a database of unique ecosystem identifiers for subscribers of services within a communications ecosystem is created. Each entry in the database for a unique ecosystem identifier comprises account information associated with the unique ecosystem identifier. Then at action the method continues with receiving notification of an account information at the centralised capability and identity resolution server for a service associated with the new subscriber. Then the method continues with updating the database entry associated with the ecosystem identifier based on the received account information action .

In some embodiments the method further comprises notifying a service provider of a change in the database affecting an account with the service provider. As described above if a device is lost or disabled one or more service providers may be notified in order to suspend services to the device.

In some embodiments the method further comprises receiving a request from a device within the ecosystem for information associated with a subscriber associated with another device within the ecosystem. In some embodiments the method further comprises receiving a request from a device within the ecosystem for information associated with a subscriber associated with another service within the ecosystem.

In some embodiments the method further comprises providing the device with the information associated with the subscriber associated with the other device or service.
