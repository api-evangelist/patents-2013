This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 949 589 filed Nov. 18 2010 entitled Hardware Based Credential Distribution the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Credentials allow a service to authenticate a client before providing resources or sharing data with the client. Services usually distribute verifiable credentials to clients to allow the client to access the resources or data over a network. Credentials are not infinite however and should only be distributed to actual users of the service. Arbitrary distribution of credentials can result in exploitation or interruptions of services such as denial of service attacks by malicious entities.

To limit distribution of credentials many services rely on human verification methods. These human verification methods use logins passwords and or challenge response tests to verify the client s identity when a service is accessed. While these human verification methods help to limit credential distribution to clients associated with human users they compromise a user s computing experience.

This document describes various techniques for distributing credentials based on hardware profiles. These techniques may validate a request for a resource by matching a hardware profile of the requesting entity to a previous hardware profile associated with that requesting entity. Once validated the techniques distribute a credential for accessing the resource. By so doing the techniques protect the resource from exploitation or attack without compromising a user s computing experience.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

This document describes various techniques for distributing credentials based on hardware profiles. These techniques can improve a user s computing experience by forgoing a login password and or response challenge though these techniques can be used in conjunction with human verification methods for additional security.

Computing device can be any device capable of communicating over a network e.g. communication network accessing resources of a service and exchanging trusted data. Computing device is illustrated by way of example and not limitation as one of a smartphone a laptop computer set top box desktop computer or tablet computer . Communication network may include any suitable network such as the Internet a local area network a wide area network a wireless network a personal area network a dial up network and or a USB bus to name a few.

Server can be any computing device having resources and or hosting a service for managing the resources such as objects data functionalities and the like. The service of server requires authentication of a client before sharing a resource with the client requesting access to the resource. In some cases authentication may be direct with computing device or brokered through a third party associated with both server and computing device not shown . A resource of server is typically referenced by a Uniform Resource Locator URL or Universal Resource Identifier URI . A URL or URI is used by a client such as computing device for initiating access of the resource. In other cases a resource may be referenced by an abstract domain in extensible markup language XML such as a namespace.

Memory media can include dynamic random access memory DRAM static random access memory SRAM read only memory ROM or any combination thereof. Memory media may be fixed or modular flexibly configured providing various configurations and or capacities of memory for computing device . For instance DRAM may be user accessible allowing a user to increase an amount of DRAM present in computing device . Alternately or additionally memory media may include information relating a manufacturer data rate and or capacity of memory device s of computing device . In some instances DRAM includes a serial presence detect integrated circuit not shown presenting information relating to a data rate and capacity of DRAM .

Storage media can include hard disk drive HDD and or flash . Storage media is internal and or external but local computer readable storage media and is capable of storing data. Hard disk drive or flash can be configured as individual storage volumes or as multiple drives of a redundant array of independent disks RAID volume. Alternately or additionally storage media can include information relating to a manufacturer model number serial number and or a capacity of a particular storage media device. For instance hard disk drive may include a model number serial number and capacity information detectable by a host device or a component of a host device.

Generally any of the techniques and abilities described herein can be implemented using software firmware hardware e.g. fixed logic circuitry manual processing or any suitable combination of these implementations. The example computing device generally represents software firmware hardware or any combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation for instance resource access manager represents computer executable instructions e.g. program code that perform specific tasks when executed on a processor e.g. CPU or CPUs . The program code can be stored in one or more computer readable media devices such as memory media and or storage media . The features and techniques described herein are platform independent meaning that they may be implemented on a variety of commercial computing platforms having a variety of processors.

The following discussion describes techniques for distributing credentials based on hardware profiles. These techniques can be used instead of or in addition to human verification methods. When used in addition to human verification methods these techniques provide additional security for credential distribution. When used instead of human verification methods these techniques forgo often annoying or time consuming user dependent activities.

By way of example assume computing device transmits a resource access request including a unique identifier and a current hardware profile to server over communication network . Server receives the unique identifier and hardware profile determines whether or not the hardware profile matches at least a portion of a stored hardware profile associated with the unique identifier and if it matches sends a credential useful to access a resource to computing device .

Aspects of these processes may be implemented in hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. These processes are shown as sets of blocks that specify operations performed such as through one or more entities or devices and are not necessarily limited to the order shown for performing the operations by the respective blocks. In portions of the following discussion reference may be made to environment of as well as entities of environment illustrated in .

The current hardware profile includes information relating to hardware components or a hardware configuration of a computing device. This profile can be generated by an application programming interface API based on information relating to hardware of a computing device such as serial numbers model numbers and or parameters of hardware components of the computing device.

The unique identifier is any certificate token identification data or combination thereof that uniquely identifies a computing device. In some cases the unique identifier is digitally signed or encrypted with a private key and or shared key to ensure authenticity. This unique identifier may be received during a secure registration process that associates the unique identifier with a hardware profile. For instance the unique identifier may be a software license validation SLV certificate received during secure registration with an SLV server. During this secure registration a hardware profile sent to the SLV server is associated with the SLV certificate.

By way of example consider process in the context of environment . Resource access manager generates a current hardware profile of laptop computer based on information relating to DRAM HDD and Network Interface . This current hardware profile includes information relating to a manufacturer and a capacity or amount of DRAM a serial number and model number of HDD and a MAC address of network interface .

Here assume that resource access manager is attempting to access a software update of server . To do so resource access manager transmits a resource access request including a unique identifier and the current hardware profile to server over communication network .

Block receives a credential useful to access a resource from the remote entity if the current hardware profile matches at least a portion of the previous hardware profile. The credential is useful to access a resource directly or access a service managing resources functionalities and or data. In the context of the present example assume that the manufacturer and capacity or amount of DRAM and the MAC address of network interface of the current hardware profile match corresponding information of a previous hardware profile associated with the certificate. Resource access manager receives from server a credential useful to access the software update resource responsive to a portion of the current hardware profile matches the previous hardware profile.

Optionally at block a resource is accessed using the received credential. The resource may be accessed directly or through a service managing the resource and or data. In some cases the resource is a functionality provided by the service such as messaging synchronizing data or trusted data exchange. Concluding the present example resource access manager accesses the software update resource of server using the received credential and downloads a software update over communication network .

The hardware profile contains information relating to the remote entity s hardware such as a collection of serial numbers model numbers and or parameters of hardware components. For instance the hardware profile can include information about a manufacturer model number serial number and a capacity of a hard disk drive.

Consider process in the context of the above mentioned example. Here server receives a resource access request from resource access manager of laptop computer through data communication network . The resource access request includes a hardware profile of laptop computer and a unique identifier in the form of certificate encrypted with a private key known to server . The hardware profile of laptop computer includes information relating to a manufacturer and a capacity or amount of DRAM a serial number and model number of HDD and a MAC address of network interface .

Block determines that the hardware profile matches at least a portion of a stored hardware profile associated with the unique identifier. The stored hardware profile may be stored during a secure registration or license validation process. For instance a hardware profile received during an SLV process may be stored and associated with an SLV certificate.

In some cases all of the information contained in the hardware profile matches the information contained in the stored hardware profile associated with the unique identifier. In other cases where only a portion of the hardware profile matches the stored hardware profile fuzzy logic may be employed to determine that the hardware profile sufficiently but not entirely matches the stored hardware profile.

A match can be determined using fuzzy logic even though information relating to a HDD of the hardware profile does not match information relating to a HDD of the stored hardware profile. A matching algorithm employing fuzzy logic provides flexible matching allowing a match to be determined for a computing device that has new and or different hardware components due to repairs and or upgrades.

This matching algorithm for example may determine that the hardware profile is sufficiently similar when two of three hardware component parameters match. The matching algorithm may determine a sufficient match based on various criteria such as serial numbers that are unlikely to change while other non matching serial numbers are acceptable for hardware often altered or replaced such as external hard drives or non integrated displays but not motherboards or processors.

Continuing the ongoing example server decrypts the certificate using a private key to identify laptop computer . Server then determines that at least a portion of the hardware profile of laptop computer matches a stored profile that is associated with the certificate included in the resource access request. Here assume that a user of laptop computer has replaced HDD of laptop computer due to a failure of a previous HDD.

In the context of the present example a matching algorithm of server employing fuzzy logic determines that the hardware profile of laptop computer sufficiently matches the stored hardware profile based on the information relating to the manufacturer and the capacity or amount of DRAM and the MAC address of network interface .

Block transmits a credential to the remote entity useful to access a resource. The credential may be useful to access a resource directly or access a service managing the resource and or providing functionality related to the resource. In some cases a credential distribution limit or rule is consulted prior to transmitting the credential limiting distribution of credentials. In some instances the credential distribution limit is associated with the unique identifier to limit credential distribution to an entity or entities claiming to be associated with the unique identifier.

Credential distribution can be limited to a total number of credentials distributed a rate of credential distribution or a frequency of credential distribution or any combination thereof. For instance credential limits associated with a unique identifier may only allow one credential to be distributed every 10 seconds with a total limit of 50 distributed credentials.

Continuing the present example assume that server has a credential distribution limit of 50 total credentials per unique identifier. Also assume that one credential has been previously issued in association to the certificate included in the resource access request received from laptop computer . Here server consults the credential distribution limit and determines that a credential can be issued to laptop computer . Concluding the present example server increments a credential distribution count associated with the unique identifier and transmits a credential useful to access a software update to laptop computer over communication network . This is but one way in which the techniques may limit credential distribution to computing devices of actual users of a service.

Consider process in the context of environment . Here server receives a resource access request from resource access manager of laptop computer over communication network . Assume that the resource access request includes a certificate encrypted with a private key and a hardware profile of laptop computer . Also assume that server is hosting a software update service and that resource access manager of laptop computer is attempting to access the software update service. In the context of the present example server does not have a private key for decrypting the certificate included in the resource access request.

Block forwards the unique identifier and hardware profile to a request validating entity having access to a historical hardware profile associated with the unique identifier. The historical hardware profile includes information previously collected relating to hardware components or a hardware configuration of a computing device. In some cases the historical hardware profile is received from a computing device during a secure registration process. In such a case the unique identifier may have been issued to the computing device and associated with the received hardware profile. For instance the unique identifier and hardware profile may be forwarded to an SLV server having a stored historical profile associated with an SLV ticket encrypted with a private key.

The request validating entity may also have access to a private and or shared key useful to decrypt an encrypted unique identifier. In some cases the request validating entity decrypts a certificate token or digital signature to expose information uniquely identifying a computing device such as an SLV server having a private key decrypting and verifying an SLV ticket included in the request.

In the context of the present example server forwards the certificate encrypted with the private key and the hardware profile of laptop to a remote request validation server not shown . Here assume that the request validation server has a private key capable of decrypting the certificate and a historical hardware profile associated with the certificate.

Block receives an indication of a validity of the request if the request validating entity determines that the hardware profile of the remote entity matches at least a portion of the historical hardware profile. This indication of validity may include identification information relating to the remote entity such as information identifying the remote entity as an owner of a software product or as a subscriber to a service. For instance an indication of the validity of the request can be received from an SLV server when at least a portion of the hardware profile of the remote entity matches a historical hardware profile associated with an SLV ticket.

Continuing the present example server receives an indication of the validity of the request when the request validation server determines that the hardware profile of laptop computer matches at least a portion of the historical hardware profile associated with the certificate. The indication of the validity of the request also includes identification information that identifies laptop computer as a subscriber of the software update service of server .

Block grants access of the resource to the remote entity based on the indication of the validity of the request. In some cases a credential useful to access the resource is transmitted to the remote entity. The credential is useful to access a resource directly or access a service managing the resource and or providing functionality related to the resource. Furthermore access to the resource may be limited or denied based on identification information relating to the remote entity. For example access may be limited to updates of a particular software product based on information that identifies the remote entity as an owner of that software product.

Concluding the present example server grants access of the software update service to laptop computer based on the validity of the request. The access granted is limited by server based on the identification information that identifies laptop computer as a subscriber to that service.

This document describes various techniques for distributing credentials based on hardware profiles. By so doing these techniques improve security and or a computing experience of a user accessing a resource via a service. Credentials useful for accessing a resource can be provided to a user without querying the user for a login password and or response challenge. Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and or methodological acts it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather the specific features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claimed invention.
