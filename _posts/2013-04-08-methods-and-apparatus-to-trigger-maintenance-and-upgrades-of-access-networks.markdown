This patent is a continuation and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 13 589 878 filed Aug. 20 2012 which is a continuation and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 12 334 194 filed Dec. 12 2008 both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

This disclosure relates generally to access networks and more particularly to methods and apparatus to trigger maintenance and upgrades of access networks.

Access networks and or systems using digital subscriber line DSL technologies are commonly utilized to provide communication services to customer premises. DSL technologies enable service providers to utilize telephone lines to connect customers to for example a high data rate broadband Internet network a broadband service and or broadband content. An example telephone line uses twisted pair copper wire to provide Plain Old Telephone System POTS services. A communication company and or service provider may utilize a plurality of DSL modems implemented by a DSLAM and or a video ready access device VRAD at a central office CO a remote terminal RT or a serving area interface SAI to provide DSL communication services to a plurality of customer premises DSL modems located at respective customer premises. In general a DSLAM VRAD receives broadband service content for a subscriber from for example a backbone server. A CO DSL modem at the DSLAM VRAD forms from the content a downstream DSL signal to be transmitted to a customer premises DSL modem via a telephone line that electrically couples the CO DSL modem at the SAI RT or CO to the customer premises DSL modem. Likewise the CO DSL modem receives an upstream DSL signal from the customer premises DSL modem via the corresponding subscriber s telephone line and the DSLAM VRAD provides the data received via the upstream DSL signal to the backbone server.

Example methods and apparatus to trigger maintenance and upgrades of access networks are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes obtaining a first value representing a number of unassigned ports associated with a first digital subscriber line DSL access multiplexer DSLAM obtaining a second value representing a projected number of ports associated with the first DSLAM needed to satisfy at least one of anticipated projected or pending service requests and determining whether to automatically submit a preventative maintenance trouble ticket for the first DSLAM based on the first and second values.

A disclosed example apparatus includes a trouble ticket system a loop facility assignment and control system LFACS a capacity planning server and an availability analyzer. The LFACS is to provide a first value representing a number of unassigned ports associated with a first DSLAM. The capacity planning server is to provide a second value representing a projected number of ports associated with the first DSLAM needed to satisfy at least one of anticipated projected or pending service requests. The availability analyzer is to compare a first ratio of the first and second values to a first threshold to determine whether to automatically submit a maintenance trouble ticket for the first DSLAM to the trouble ticket system the submitted trouble ticket identifying that one or more bad ports associated with the first DSLAM are to be investigated.

In the interest of brevity and clarity throughout the following disclosure references will be made to an example access network of . However the methods and apparatus described herein to trigger maintenance and upgrades of access networks are applicable to other types of access networks and or communication systems constructed using other network technologies topologies and or protocols. Other example systems include but are not limited to those associated with public switched telephone network PSTN systems public land mobile network PLMN systems e.g. cellular wireless distribution systems wired or cable distribution systems coaxial cable distribution systems Ultra High Frequency UHF Very High Frequency VHF radio frequency systems satellite or other extra terrestrial systems cellular distribution systems power line broadcast systems fiber optic networks passive optical network PON systems and or any combination and or hybrid of these devices systems and or networks.

While in the illustrated example of the DSLAMs VRADs are implemented at the CO any of the DSLAMs VRADs may be additionally or alternatively implemented at an RT at an SAI and or at any other location between the CO and the customer premises . In such instances a fiber optic cable not shown may be used for example to communicatively couple the remotely located DSLAM VRAD to the CO .

In the illustrated example of the DSLAM provides DSL services to the CPE DSL modems via respective subscriber lines and . Subscriber lines are sometimes also referred to in the industry as wire pairs subscriber loops and or loops. While throughout this disclosure reference is made to the example loops of a loop e.g. any of the example loops used to provide a DSL service to a customer premises location e.g. any of the locations may include and or be constructed from one or more segments of twisted pair telephone wire e.g. any combination of a feeder one F1 cable a feeder two F2 cable a feeder three F3 cable a feeder four F4 cable a distribution cable a drop cable and or customer premises wiring terminals and or distributions points e.g. an RT an SAI a serving terminal a vault a pedestal and or any other type s of wiring distribution points . Such segments of twisted pair telephone wire may be spliced and or connected end to end and or may be connected at only one end thereby creating one or more bridged taps. Regardless of the number type s gauge s and or topology of twisted pair telephone wires used to construct the example loops they will be referred to herein in the singular form but it will be understood that the term loop may refer to one or more twisted pair telephone wire segments and may include one or more bridged taps.

To assign DSLAM VRAD ports to the example loops the example access network of includes any type of mechanized loop assignment center MLAC any type of LFACS and a port loop assignment database . DSLAM VRAD port to loop assignments may be stored in the example port loop assignment database of using any number and or type s of data structures. The example port loop assignment database may be stored in any number and or type s of volatile and or non volatile memory ies and or memory device s not shown .

In response to for example an order for new DSL service for a particular customer premises received from for example any type of customer service server the example MLAC of assigns and or selects a particular port of a DSLAM VRAD to be used to provide the DSL service to that customer premises . The example customer service server of may interact with the example MLAC using any number and or type s of method s application programming interface s API s and or logic. When the presently considered customer premises is already associated with a particular loop e.g. any of the example loops to receive for example plain old telephone service POTS the example MLAC associates the already associated loop with the selected DSLAM VRAD port. When the presently considered customer premises is not already associated with a loop the MLAC selects a loop that is available between the DSLAM VRAD and the customer premises and associates the selected loop with the selected DSLAM VRAD port.

The example MLAC of may also be accessed using an interactive voice response IVR and or automated attendant system not shown . For example a technician at the example customer premises to install and or troubleshoot the example CPE DSL modem can telephone an IVR system implemented at the example MLAC to request that the customer premises be assigned a different DSLAM VRAD port. Such port swap requests may occur to determine whether a problem associated with the CPE DSL modem at the customer premises is caused by a bad DSLAM VRAD port. When such a DSLAM VRAD port assignment change occurs the example MLAC and or the example LFACS flag the DSLAM VRAD port as potentially bad thereby making the flagged DSLAM VRAD port unavailable for use by and or assignment to other customer premises . In some circumstances such a DSLAM VRAD port swap may not resolve the issue s with the CPE DSL modem . Unless the example technician subsequently accesses the MLAC to indicate that the original DSLAM VRAD port was not in fact bad the original DSLAM VRAD port will remain flagged as potentially faulty by the example MLAC and the example LFACS . As such some DSLAM VRAD ports may remain unavailable for assignment and or for use in diagnosing a service problem even though they may in fact be operating correctly. The example technician may likewise request that a loop associated with the customer premises be changed and or swapped. Swapped loops are likewise flagged as potentially bad and may become unavailable for use to provide services to another customer premises unless the technician subsequently indicates that the swapped loop was in fact not faulty. In some instances the diagnostic swaps of ports and or loops may be more prevalent during field trials and or the deployment of new and or emerging services.

The example technician of may additionally or alternatively interact with the example MLAC via any type of wired and or wireless communication technology. For example the technician may use a portable computer not shown to access the example MLAC to request DSLAM VRAD port and or loop swaps.

The example MLAC of interacts with the example LFACS to identify which DSLAM VRAD ports and or loops are available for assignment to a particular customer premises . In response to such requests the example LFACS of queries the example port loop assignment database . When a DSLAM VRAD port and or loop assignment and or swap is identified by the MLAC the example LFACS of updates the port loop assignment database and configures the corresponding DSLAM VRAD via any type of access management system .

To proactively monitor DSLAM VRAD port utilization the example access network of includes an availability analyzer . Based on DSLAM VRAD port utilization information and or loop utilization information stored in the example port loop assignment database the example availability analyzer of determines whether maintenance should be performed for a particular DSLAM VRAD . Periodically and or aperiodically the example availability analyzer queries the example LFACS to obtain the number A of currently assigned ports and the number B of ports that are flagged and or identified as bad and or potentially bad for a presently considered DSLAM VRAD . The availability analyzer also queries and or obtains a desired number N of ports that are needed for pending and or projected service needs for the presently considered DSLAM VRAD from any type of capacity planning server system and or organization . Based on the numbers A and N the example availability analyzer of determines whether maintenance is needed for the presently considered DSLAM VRAD to restore flagged ports and or loops to a correctly operation state. For some loops and or ports a service technician may only need to test and verify that the port and or loop was in fact fully operation and simply change its status in the port loop assignment database via the LFACS . In other circumstances ports and or loops may require repair and or replacement in order to return them to an available state. The example availability analyzer of also uses the numbers A B and N to determine whether the port capacity of a DSLAM VRAD and or CO RT SAI needs to be upgraded. An example manner of implementing the example availability analyzer of is described below in connection with . An example process that may be carried out to implement the example availability analyzer is described below in connection with .

By proactively monitoring port exhaustion for the example DSLAMs VRADs of the example availability analyzer provides a number of benefits to an operator of the example access network . For example by proactively identifying DSLAMs VRADs that are in need of maintenance and or upgrades the example availability analyzer can help ensure that enough ports are available to sell promote and or otherwise provide new services to additional customers and or to facilitate the timely and efficient resolution of reported and or identified problems. For example if there are no remaining available DSLAM VRAD ports the example technician would be unable to request a port swap as part of a troubleshooting and or diagnostic process. Such circumstances may result in wasted technician time lost revenue a diminished perceived image and or reputation and or decreased customer satisfaction.

When the example availability analyzer of identifies a particular DSLAM VRAD as requiring maintenance to restore the DSLAM VRAD to a state having a sufficient number A of available ports and or loops to support pending and or projected service needs the example availability analyzer automatically generates and or submits a maintenance ticket to any type of trouble ticket system . Such an automatically generated and or submitted maintenance ticket represents preventative prospective forecasted and or projected maintenance needs that should be performed in order to for example reduce the likelihood that a requested service cannot be installed and or provisioned when requested by a subscriber and or to reduce the likelihood that a reported service problem cannot be resolved in a timely manner. In response to the submitted maintenance ticket an appropriate service and or maintenance technician can be dispatched to return as many flagged ports and or loops associated with the DSLAM VRAD to an operational state. If the number A of available ports is determined to be critically low relative to the number N of needed ports the example availability analyzer sets adjusts and or modifies a severity flag and or priority value associated with the maintenance ticket to identify that maintenance for the DSLAM VRAD is needed and or required on an urgent basis. The number A may be determined to be critically low when for example the ratio A N is less than a predefined threshold.

Based on a plurality of numbers B B . . . of bad and or potentially bad ports associated with respective DSLAMs VRADs the example availability analyzer creates an ordered list of the DSLAMs VRADs . The list of DSLAMs VRADs are ordered based upon their respective number B of bad and or potentially bad ports. In some examples only DSLAMs VRADs that have been identified as having an insufficient number A of available ports and or loops are included in the ordered list. The list of ordered DSLAMs VRADs may be presented and or accessed by a maintenance organization via for example a web based graphical user interface GUI and or a web based dashboard.

Further the entries fields and or data illustrated in may be combined divided re arranged eliminated and or implemented in any way. Further still a maintenance report may include entries fields and or data in addition to or instead of those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated entries fields and or data.

Returning to as described below in connection with the example availability analyzer of computes a capacity gap G for each analyzed DSLAM VRAD . Based on a plurality of capacity gaps G G . . . associated with respective DSLAMs VRADs the example availability analyzer creates another ordered list of the DSLAMs VRADs . The additional list of DSLAMs VRADs is ordered based upon their respective capacity gap G. In some examples only DSLAMs VRADs that have been identified as needing a capacity upgrade are included in this second ordered list. The second list of ordered DSLAMs VRADs may be presented and or accessed by a user not shown of the example capacity planning server via for example a web based GUI and or a web based dashboard.

To store a computed capacity gap G each of the example entries of includes a gap field . Each of the example gap fields of contains a value that represents the gap between the pending and or projected needs of the DSLAM VRAD represented by the corresponding identifier field and the potential number of ports that could be available at the DSLAM VRAD assuming maintenance of the DSLAM VRAD is performed. The example entries of are sorted based on the example values stored in the gap fields such that the DSLAM VRAD having the smallest capacity gap G that is in most need of a capacity upgrade appears at the top of the capacity planning report .

Further the example MLAC the example LFACS the example customer service server the example AMS the example availability server the example capacity planning server and or the example trouble ticket system of may be implemented by hardware software firmware and or any combination of hardware software and or firmware. Thus for example any of the example MLAC the example LFACS the example customer service server the example AMS the example availability server the example capacity planning server and or the example trouble ticket system may be implemented by one or more device s circuit s programmable processor s application specific integrated circuit s ASIC s programmable logic device s PLD s and or field programmable logic device s FPLD s etc. Further still an access network may include interfaces data structures elements processes and or devices instead of or in addition to those illustrated in and or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated interfaces data structures elements processes and or devices.

To analyze the capacity of the example DSLAMs VRADs the example availability analyzer of includes a data analysis module . The example data analysis module of queries via the example interface module the example LFACS to obtain the number A of currently assigned ports and the number B of ports that are flagged and or identified as bad and or potentially bad for a presently considered DSLAM VRAD .

Based on the obtained numbers A and N the example data analysis module of determines whether maintenance is needed for the presently considered DSLAM VRAD to restore flagged ports and or loops to a correctly operation state. The example data analysis module also uses the numbers A B and N to determine whether the port capacity of a DSLAM VRAD and or CO RT SAI needs to be upgraded. An example process that may be carried out to implement the data analysis module is described below in connection with .

To initiate DSLAM VRAD port utilization analysis by the example data analysis module the example availability analyzer of includes any type of scheduler . Based on any number and or type s of criteria the example scheduler of periodically or aperiodically directs the data analysis module to analyze one or more of the example DSLAMs VRADs . For example the example scheduler could initiate port and or loop analysis on a daily a weekly and or a monthly basis. Additionally and or alternatively operation of the example data analysis module may be trigger by for example a person associated with the example maintenance organization and or the capacity planning server .

To interact with the example trouble ticket system of the example availability analyzer of includes a trouble ticket submitter . The example trouble ticket submitter of generates and submits maintenance tickets against DSLAMs VRADs that were identified by a data analysis module as needing to have maintenance performed.
