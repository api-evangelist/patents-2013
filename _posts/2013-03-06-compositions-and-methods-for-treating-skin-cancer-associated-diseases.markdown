This invention was made with government support under grant number R01 AR051380 and R01 CA165836 awarded by National Institute of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates to compositions and methods for treating skin cancer associated diseases. Specifically the invention relates to topically administering tyrosine kinase inhibitors and related compounds to treat pre cancerous skin lesions skin tumors and their associated diseases or disorders.

Actinic keratosis AK is the most common precancerous lesion manifesting as thickened scaly or crusty patches of skin in humans and its treatment represents a common reason for patients to see a dermatologist. Recent studies estimate that there are approximately 58 million AKs in the US population leading to 5.2 million office visits per year with an approximate cost of 0.9 1.2 billion dollars. The risk for developing an AK is directly related to the degree of photodamage which is a function of age sun exposure and Fitzpatrick skin type being more common in fair skinned people . Studies show that multiple AKs significantly decrease the quality of life in patients leading some investigators to use the term actinic neoplasia syndrome for such patients. Some of these pre cancers progress to squamous cell carcinoma cSCC which is discussed below.

Current AK treatments involve topical and destructive modalities. AKs can be treated by freezing the skin with liquid nitrogen N . Although technically simple this therapy has adverse effects which include dyspigmentation pain stinging and a low efficacy rate liquid Nis associated with only an 83 clearance rate and lacks specificity for lesional cells requiring the freezing of at least 1 mm of surrounding non lesional tissue. Other commonly used destructive therapies include curettage and surgical excision. Since patients often have many AKs requiring treatment this limits the use of destructive modalities because of the cosmetic deficits associated with dyspigmentation and scarring.

The primary topical agents to treat AKs are 5 fluorouracil 5 FU imiquimod ALDARA and diclofenac e.g. SOLARAZE 5 FU is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits RNA and DNA synthesis and targets dividing cells which are more prevalent in AKs than adjacent epidermis. 5 FU is used as 0.5 2.5 or 5.0 formulations which correspond to compound concentrations of 36 360 mM . 5 FU has significant side effects including prominent inflammation ulceration and even scarring given these side effects topical 5 FU is associated with a lower quality of life for patients. Imiquimod a Toll receptor 7 agonist produces prominent inflammation to eliminate AKs. The prominent inflammation stimulated by imiquimod is irritating and mimics psoriasis and this reaction has been associated with autoimmune reactions such as alopecia areata and vitiligo. Another common topical agent to treat AKs is diclofenac a topical non steroidal anti inflammatory compound with an unclear mechanism of action on actinic keratoses. Recent studies using diclofenac and imiquimod showed therapeutic weaknesses associated with poor clearance rates and significant irritation. Overall the most commonly used topical agents to treat AKs have significant negative features including irritation decreased quality of life and limited efficacy.

cSCC is the second most common form of cancer with an annual incidence of 620 000 cases annually. According to some studies cSCCs cause approximately 8 000 cases of nodal metastasis leading to 3 000 deaths in the US alone each year. In 2004 the estimated cost of treating cSCCs in the US alone was approximately 500 million dollars. The risk factors for cSCCs are similar to those for AKs and include age male sex and cumulative UV exposure from sunlight or tanning salons. Since Americans are living longer spending more time outdoors and not adequately using sunscreens it is likely that the numbers of cSCCs in the United States will increase as will the cost to treat them.

In another embodiment as described in U.S. Patent Publication 2008 0193504 small peptides which compete with larger phosphotyrosine peptides for binding to the Src kinase protein may be used to inhibit Src family kinases in particular small phosphotyrosine containing peptide ligands 5 to 6 amino acids which are able to compete with larger phosphotyrosine containing peptides and protein ligands for binding to SH2 domains thereby inhibiting the Src family kinases. In another embodiment small peptides which correspond to catalytic or enzymatic domains of Src kinase and would compete with Src kinase may be used to inhibit the activation of downstream components of the Src kinase signaling cascade. In another embodiment SFK inhibitors include the use of larger polypeptides that inhibit Src kinase activity including but not limited to Csk carboxyl terminal Src kinase which is a specific physiologic inhibitor of Src kinase. Further examples of larger polypeptides that inhibit Src kinase activity include for example Src dominant negative mutants i.e. Srck Barone et al. 1995 Nature 378 509 512 and Fyn dominant negative mutants Twamley Stein et al. 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 7696 7700 . In some embodiments antibodies or other larger molecules that inhibit Src kinase activity may be used.

As used herein the term selective with respect to inhibition means preferential inhibition of a first activity relative to a second activity e.g. preferential inhibition of one signaling pathway to another signaling pathway preferential inhibition relative to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors or preferential inhibition of a mutant to a wild type or vice versa . In some embodiments the inhibitor is greater than five times more selective greater than ten times more selective greater than fifty times more selective greater than 100 times more selective or greater than 1000 times more selective for the desired molecular target or pathway versus an undesired molecular target or pathway. In some embodiments the inhibitor inhibits the first activity of the molecular target or pathway by at least 2 fold at least 5 fold at least 10 fold at least 20 fold at least 50 fold at least 100 fold relative to the second activity of the molecular target or pathway under the same conditions. The activity of a molecular target or pathway may be measured by any reproducible means. The activity of a molecular target or pathway may be measured in vitro or in vivo.

As used herein modulating refers to stimulating or inhibiting an activity of a molecular target or pathway. In one aspect a composition modulates the activity of a molecular target or pathway if it stimulates or inhibits the activity of the molecular target or pathway by at least 10 by at least about 10 by at least about 20 by at least about 25 by at least about 30 by at least about 40 by at least about 50 by at least about 60 by at least about 70 by at least about 75 by at least about 80 by at least about 90 by at least about 95 by at least about 98 or by about 99 or more relative to the activity of the molecular target or pathway under the same conditions but lacking only the presence of the composition. In one aspect the composition modulates the activity of a molecular target or pathway if it stimulates or inhibits the activity of the molecular target or pathway by at least 2 fold at least 5 fold at least 10 fold at least 20 fold at least 50 fold at least 100 fold relative to the activity of the molecular target or pathway under the same conditions but lacking only the presence of the composition. The activity of a molecular target or pathway may be measured by any reproducible means. The activity of a molecular target or pathway may be measured in vitro or in vivo. For example the activity of a molecular target or pathway may be measured in vitro or in vivo by an enzymatic activity assay. For example samples or assays comprising one or more components of a protein kinase signaling pathway such as one or more components of a PI3K PDK1 AKT signaling pathway e.g. mTOR can be treated with the composition and compared to control samples without the composition. Control samples untreated with the composition can be assigned a relative activity value of 100 . A change in enzymatic activity caused by the composition can be measured in the assays. For example the change in enzymatic activity can be characterized by the change in the extent of phosphorylation of certain substrates.

It will be appreciated that many of the inhibitors described herein are strong inhibitors of their targets. For example an inhibitor has a binding inhibitory activity ICvalue for its desired molecular target of 1000 M or less 1000 nM or less 100 nM or less 10 nM or less or especially 1 nM or less. In another example the inhibitor has a binding inhibitory activity ICvalue for its desired molecular target of between 1000 M and 1 nM between 1000 M and 10 nM between 1000 M and 100 nM between 1000 M and 1000 nM between 1000 nM and 1 nM between 1000 nM and 10 nM between 1000 nM and 100 nM between 100 nM and 10 nM between 100 nM and 1 nM or between 10 nM and 1 nM.

In some embodiments the inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit their molecular targets or pathways by at least about 10 by at least about 20 by at least about 25 by at least about 30 by at least about 40 by at least about 50 by at least about 60 by at least about 70 by at least about 75 by at least about 80 by at least about 90 by at least about 95 by at least about 98 or by about 99 or more.

As used herein phosphorylation refers to the addition of phosphate groups to a substrate including proteins and organic molecules and plays an important role in regulating the biological activities of proteins. In one aspect the phosphorylation assayed and measured involves the addition of phosphate groups to tyrosine residues. The substrate can be a peptide or protein.

The Janus kinases JAK are a family of intracellular non receptor tyrosine kinases that include JAK1 JAK2 JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 TYK2 . The JAKs play a role in cytokine signaling. The downstream substrates of the JAK family of kinases include the signal tranducer activator of transcription STAT proteins. JAK STAT signaling has been implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies asthma autoimmune diseases such as transplant allograft rejection rheumatoid arthritis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas.

Src family tyrosine kinases SFKs were the first oncogenes identified and they play central roles in promoting neoplasia in most tissues. SFKs are downstream effectors of EGFR and activate the Ras Mek Erk pathway in human keratinocytes. In contrast with Src Fyn is prominently acylated on its N terminus and localizes to lipid rafts which are important membrane subdomains for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Fyn plays a major role in keratinocyte biology as lipid rafts are critical for EGFR signaling. Increased EGFR activity has been seen in a variety of human epidermal cancers including actinic keratoses squamous cell carcinoma and Bowen s disease.

Serial sections from 17 human AKs were analyzed for activated SFKs and Srcasm levels Immunohistochemistry demonstrated elevated SFK activity and decreased Srcasm levels in the AKs . Adjacent unremarkable epidermis Unr demonstrated increased SFK activity in the basal cell layer with low Srcasm levels and decreased SFK activity with higher Srcasm levels in the suprabasilar epidermis . The high prevalence of increased SFK activation in these lesions suggests that elevated SFK activity represents a key pathophysiologic feature of human AKs and sSCCs.

To model these observations K14 Fyn Y528F transgenic mice were generated. These mice spontaneously develop precancerous lesions resembling human AKs and cSCCs in 5 8 weeks. Furthermore these lesions resemble the human disease at the histologic and molecular levels. Increased Fyn activity lowers p53 levels in the precancerous lesions and cSCCs likely through a Mek Erk c Jun dependent mechanism See . Recent work has shown that SFKs regulate UVB induced protein kinase D PKD activity in a time and dose dependent manner in primary murine keratinocytes. The mechanism for activating PKD requires SFK activity. Activation of PKD in UVB treated cells inhibits UVB dependent apoptosis and increases the survival of keratinocytes with DNA damage thereby promoting neoplasia. Fyn phosphorylates PKC and PKC is an important regulator of UVB induced apoptosis.

Srcasm Src activating and signaling molecule has been shown to negatively regulate SFKs by targeting them for degradation in a lysosomal dependent manner. Srcasm levels are decreased in human AKs and cSCCs and Srcasm downregulation in these lesions inversely correlates with activation of SFKs in human lesions . As discussed below increasing Srcasm levels induces regression of established cSCCs in K14 Fyn Y528F mice suggesting that Srcasm levels in skin are critical for regulating cutaneous neoplasia.

Oncogenic Ras is a major driver of cSCCs. Recent in vitro data from HaCaT cells demonstrates that Fyn is a key effector of oncogenic H Ras G12V. In these studies oncogenic H Ras induces Fyn mRNA 100 fold but not Src or Yes. Fyn was required for cell invasion and motility and Fyn also was necessary for H Ras induced activation of focal adhesion kinase FAK . H Ras induces Fyn mRNA levels through an Akt dependent mechanism. Since Fyn activates the PI 3K Akt pathway it may amplify its own expression through a positive feedback mechanism.

To determine if Fyn and Srcasm regulate UVB induced responses in skin 5 6 week old K14 Fyn Y528F K14 Srcasm and K14 Fyn Y528F K14 Srcasm transgenic mice and controls were subjected to one dose of 1200 mJ cmof UVB. Mice were depilated two days prior to irradiation and were biopsied at distinct sites on the back at day 0 pre irradiation 2 and 10 non tumorigenic skin was biopsied in K14 Fyn Y528F mice. K14 Fyn Y528F mice demonstrated marked skin thickening by day 5 this was not seen in other cohorts data not shown . Histologic skin sections demonstrated marked epidermal hyperplasia in K14 Fyn Y528F mice control K14 Srcasm and K14 Fyn Y528F K14 Srcasm mice all demonstrated mild epidermal hyperplasia relative to the day 0 biopsies . The UVB induced hyperplasia in K14 Fyn Y528F mice was associated with increased keratinocyte proliferation and a persistent DNA damage response revealed by subnuclear staining for phospho H2A.X Ser 139 . Phospho H2A.X nuclear staining was not seen in other day 10 or any day 0 biopsies. These data show that increased Fyn activity promotes UVB induced epidermal hyperplasia and an activated DNA damaged repair response. Elevated Srcasm levels in the K14 Fyn Y528F K14 Srcasm transgenic mice corrected the UVB induced hyperplasia and H2A.X DNA damage response. Keratinocyte proliferation associated with DNA damage promotes cutaneous neoplasia and suggests that K14 Fyn Y528F mice will have an increased susceptibility to UVB induced carcinogenesis. This hypothesis was tested by chronically irradiating K14 Fyn Y528F mice and controls. K14 Fyn Y528F mice developed multiple new cSCCs after 7 weeks of UVB radiation while controls did not . K14 Fyn Y528F mice do not develop new cSCCs after 11 weeks of age.

As discussed in the previous example K14 Fyn Y528F mice represent a robust model of cutaneous carcinogenesis which yields lesions that mimic human precancerous lesions this model presents a unique in vivo screening tool to test the topical efficacy of small molecule kinase inhibitors in preventing the formation of precancerous lesions and cutaneous SCCs.

The phenotype of K14 Fyn Y528F transgenic mice yields precancerous lesions and cutaneous SCCs that resemble their human counterparts at the clinical histologic and molecular levels. Characterization of the K14 Fyn Y528F model demonstrates that the formation of precancerous and cSCC lesions is directly dependent on an elevated level of activated SFKs in keratinocytes.

Given the robust phenotype of the K14 Fyn Y528F mice this transgenic line represents an excellent physiologically relevant in vivo model for testing the efficacy of topical agents in preventing precancerous and cancerous lesions.

Topical application of the small molecule EGFR inhibitor AG1478 Caibiochem MW 315.8 has been shown to inhibit UV induced tumor formation in transgenic models overexpressing v Ras. SFK inihibitors such as PP2 aka AG1879 Caibiochem MW 301.8 are slightly smaller molecules and have similar physicochemical properties as AG1478. Therefore AG1879 may exhibit similar cutaneous absorption characteristics as AG1478 and its efficacy can be tested in inhibiting the formation of precancerous lesions and cSCCs through topical application. In addition topical application of PP2 could be tested to determine if the compound can cause the regression of existing precancerous lesions and cSCCs. Additional supportive scientific data for testing PP2 comes from studies using radio labeled tryphostin RG 14620 a non specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor MW 275.1 this radio labeled tyrosine kinase inhibitor applied in a white petrolatum ointment to rat skin demonstrated epidermal penetration. PP2 has a molecular weight MW of 301.8 and it meets the 500 dalton rule for efficient penetration of the stratum corneum. For these reasons it is important to test PP2 as a topical agent for treating the precancerous lesions and cSCCs in K14 Fyn Y528F mice.

Since human skin has a thicker epidermis and stratum corneum than murine skin one may consider whether PP2 will penetrate murine skin but not human skin. However there are studies demonstrating that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein which bears structural semblance to PP2 can penetrate both murine skin and human skin reconstructs to inhibit UVB induced signaling and DNA damage. Therefore if we can show that PP2 inhibits the formation of precancerous lesions and cSCCs in K14 Fyn Y528F mice it is likely that this compound or its congeners can be formulated to penetrate human skin efficiently.

Topical 5 FU is the first line topical agent for treating AKs in humans and can be tested as the therapeutic positive control and to validate K14 Fyn Y528F mice as a model of cutaneous neoplasia.

AG1879 has the chemical name of 4 Amino 5 4 chlorophenyl 7 t butyl pyrazolopyrimidine and it is a small molecule inhibitor of SFKs with a molecular weight of 301.8. AG1879 is similar structurally to AG1478 an EGFR inhibitor shown to penetrate murine skin when topically applied in DMSO. AG1879 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases p59T IC 5 nM and Src IC 100 nM . Since AG1879 is slightly smaller than AG1478 it is likely to penetrate the murine stratum corneum as efficiently perhaps even more efficiently than AG1478. One can apply 10 25 L of a 10 m solution to a target area using the treatment regimens outlined below. The dose will be 1 2.5 10moles of compounds which if completely absorbed into the circulation would result in a maximum systemic concentration of approximately 10 nM average weight of adult mouse 22 g JAX labs . If phenotypic changes are seen in non treated areas due to systemic levels of percutaneously absorbed compound then the topical doses will be reduced in a systemic manner.

PP3 Calbiochem is a Negative Control Compound for PP2 and has the Chemical Name 4 Amino 7 Phenylpyrazolpyrimidine.

PP3 will be applied in an analogous manner as PP2 in DMSO. PP3 has an IC 2.7 uM for EGFR which should not be an issue in treating K14 Fyn Y528F mice because Fyn is downstream of EGFR.

the squamous cell carcinoma in situ SCIS like lesions are manifested by hyperkeratotic plaques that appear at approximately 5 7 days post natally and are present through 4 weeks of age. The topical agents can be applied singly to individual mice in marked treatment areas. The agent can be applied daily beginning at day 5 7 and we may initially treat for 14 days. Not all hyperkeratotic plaques will be treated to determine if systemic levels of percutaneously absorbed PP2 affect the phenotype. Initially ten mice will be treated with each compound ten untreated mice will serve as treatment controls. Biopsies of treated and untreated areas can be taken at day 21.

K14 Fyn Y528F mice develop precancerous lesions mimicking AKs and cutaneous SCCs between 5 8 weeks of age. Application of the topical agents before 5 weeks may prevent the formation of these lesions and demonstrate a chemopreventive potential for the topical agents in this study mice may receive topical agents to designated treatment areas beginning at 21 days and ending at day 42. Each treatment group may contain ten mice and the non treated control group may also comprise ten mice.

K14 Fyn Y528F mice develop multiple precancerous lesions and cSCCs between 5 8 weeks of age. The topical agents can be applied after the development of these lesions to determine if these compounds can function as chemoablative agents. After the development of precancerous lesions and cSCC the topical agents can be applied to the lesions for 14 21 days. The treated and untreated lesions can be analyzed at the end of the treatment course.

The phenotypes of each K14 Fyn Y528F treatment group and the control group can be analyzed by counting the number of precancerous lesions and cSCCs in treated areas and non treated areas of the treatment groups with those of control mice. Photographic documentation can be performed to monitor the phenotype. Phenotypic alterations can be analyzed by taking biopsies and subjecting the tissue to the following analytical techniques 

Skin biopsies can be taken from each treatment group in the treated and untreated areas. Parallel biopsies can be taken from the control group. One can characterize the histology of precursor lesions and cSCCs from the treatment and control cohorts. The number of precursor lesions can be determined.

Lysates from treated and control areas can be subjected to western blot analysis to detect activated SFKs Fyn Notch 1 NICD Srcasm p53 p21 and 3 actin. This can determine the mechanistic effects of topical PP2 application on skin lesions.

The average number of precancerous lesions and cSCCs can be determined for each treatment group and the control group. The statistical significance can be evaluated using an independent groups T test for the means.

Since the K14 Fyn Y528F phenotype depends on increased Fyn activity the topical application of PP2 can inhibit intracellular Fyn kinase activity and decrease the formation of precancerous lesions and cSCCs. Therefore PP2 can have chemoablative effects on precursor lesions since these lesions are unlikely to acquire other genomic mutations that might promote non Fyn dependent autonomous growth.

To determine the effects of topical application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP2 was applied topically to a cohort of five K14 Fyn Y528F mice with a total of 11 cSCCs. PP2 is a well characterized inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases with a molecular weight of 301.8 daltons therefore this compound is smaller than 500 daltons which is the molecular weight cut off for penetrating the skin efficiently. Tumors received approximately 25 L of 1 mM a 0.03 solution PP2 daily for 30 days Monday thru Friday and were evaluated by photography before initiating treatment and every Friday for 6 weeks. As a control a cohort of 4 mice with 9 cSCCs was treated analogously with PP3 an inactive PP2 analog. The cSCCs represent keratotic tumors larger than 3 3 mm as measured by calipers . All PP2 treated tumors N 11 demonstrated significant tumor regression as defined by a 75 or greater decrease in tumor area. None N 9 of the PP3 treated tumors demonstrated 75 regression during the treatment period. These results are statistically significant with p

To better understand the effect of topical PP2 treatment a histologic analysis of tissue demonstrating tumor clearance was performed. An ear covered with a cSCC as manifested by nodular masses hyperkeratosis and crusting was treated 30 times with 1 mM PP2 in DMSO . Histologic features of PP2 induced clearance of cSCC in K14 Fyn Y528F mice. One millimolar PP2 in DMSO was topically applied once a day Monday Friday for 30 times to a cSCC covering the dorsum of the ear. Prominent clearance of the cSCC was noted six weeks after beginning treatment.

Prominent clearance of the tumor was noted with smoothening of the skin surface and re growth of hair. The histologic sections of this area show a small focus of residual cSCC adjacent to a zone of epidermal hyperplasia and mild mixed dermal inflammation. Notably absent are prominent inflammation ulceration or skin peeling as might be seen with 5 FU treatment.

As shown in PP2 induces clearance of precancerous lesion in three weeks. One millimolar PP2 in DMSO was topically applied once a day Monday Friday for 20 times to a small precancerous lesion on the ear and to a cSCC on the neck. Clearance of both lesions was noted by three weeks after initiating treatment. shows that PP2 induces tumor regression in five weeks.
