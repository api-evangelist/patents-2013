The present disclosure relates to input modules for electronic devices and more particularly to methods sensors and devices which recognize a contactless gesture.

Electronic devices are often equipped with one or more input devices for receiving instructions commands and other input from users of such electronic devices. For example electronic devices often have one or more depressible buttons or keys which may be activated by a user to input instructions commands and other input to the electronic device. Such input devices may include a track pad trackball or touch pad which may be used for providing navigational input to the electronic device. Recently touchscreen display screens have become commonplace. Touchscreen displays are displays which have a touch sensitive overlay for receiving input.

While input devices for electronic devices are available in many different shapes and sizes such input devices often require a user to engage a specific portion of an electronic device such as a button through direct contact with that portion e.g. by pressing a button . Such contact may soil the electronic device. For example touchscreen displays sometimes become obscured from fingerprints which are left on the display following user contact. In addition to attracting dirt and debris repeated contact on mechanically activated input devices may result in failure of such input devices over time e.g. repeated pressing of a button may result in failure of that button .

Contactless input mechanisms have been proposed but techniques for interpreting contactless gestures are typically resource or hardware intensive requiring a large amount of processing capabilities or extensive hardware components.

Other example embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed descriptions in conjunction with the drawings.

Reference will now be made to which illustrate an example electronic device which includes a gesture sensor . A top view of the electronic device is illustrated in . illustrates a cross sectional view of the electronic device taken along line of .

The gesture sensor is configured to allow a user of the electronic device to input one or more instructions commands or other input to the electronic device . More particularly the gesture sensor may be configured to receive contactless input from a user of the electronic device . Contactless input which may also be referred to as touch less input is input which does not require a user to physically touch the electronic device . For example the contactless input may be provided by a user to the electronic device through movement of a hand or other object in a specific region near the electronic device .

More particularly the contactless input may be provided by a user by moving a hand or other object within a sensing area associated with the gesture sensor . The sensing area may be described as a region of space near the electronic device in which the electronic device is able to monitor movements of objects. More particularly the sensing area may be described in one example as a region of space in which the gesture sensor is able to detect object movement such as the movement of a hand.

The gesture sensor in at least some embodiments allows the electronic device to identify an air gesture performed within the sensing area of the gesture sensor . An air gesture is contactless input having one or more predetermined characteristics. For example a swipe gesture may be characterized by movement of an object such as a hand in a direction that is substantially parallel to the electronic device. The electronic device is in at least some embodiments configured to identify a direction of a swipe gesture. For example the electronic device may determine whether the swipe gesture is in a first direction e.g. left to right or a second direction e.g. right to left . Techniques for identifying the type of air gesture that is performed will be discussed in greater detail below.

In the embodiment of the electronic device is a smartphone. A smartphone is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capability than a basic non smart cellular phone. For example a smartphone may have the ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.

In other embodiments the electronic device may be a tablet computer. A tablet computer which may also be referred to as a tablet is an electronic device which is generally larger than a mobile phone such as a smartphone or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized. That is mobile phones or personal digital assistants are generally small enough to be carried by a person easily often in a shirt or pant pocket while tablet computers are larger and may not fit within pant pockets. For example many tablet computers have a height which is seven inches 7 or more. In some example embodiments the tablet computer may be a slate computer. A slate computer is a tablet computer which does not include a dedicated keyboard. A slate computer may allow for text input through the use of a virtual keyboard or an external keyboard which connects to the slate computer via a wired or wireless connection.

The electronic device may in other embodiments be of another type. For example in some embodiments the electronic device may be a remote control such as a television remote control a navigation system such as a Global Positioning System a wearable computer such as a watch a personal digital assistant PDA a desktop netbook notebook or laptop style computer system or a television.

Furthermore in at least some embodiments the electronic device may be a gesture companion device. A gesture companion device is an electronic device which acts as a peripheral for another electronic device. More particularly the gesture companion device may be an input device which may be used for receiving contactless input. Where the electronic device is a gesture companion device the contactless input may be used for example by another electronic device which may be referred to as a primary electronic device . The primary electronic device may for example be a smartphone tablet computer television navigation system PDA desktop netbook notebook or laptop style computer system or an electronic device of a different type. The gesture companion device may be used for receiving contactless input but the contactless input may control the primary electronic device. That is the primary electronic device may perform a function based on contactless input received at the gesture companion device.

In the embodiment of the electronic device includes a display . The display is disposed to be viewable from a front side of the electronic device . The front side of the electronic device may include other features that are not illustrated in such as for example one or more input interfaces such as a button keyboard etc. one or more cameras etc.

In the embodiment illustrated the electronic device is oriented in a portrait orientation in which it height is longer than its width. It will however be appreciated that the techniques described herein may also be used when the electronic device is oriented in a different orientation. For example an air gesture may also be identified when the electronic device is oriented in a landscape orientation in which its width is longer than its height.

Components of the electronic device are housed within a housing . As illustrated the housing frames the display . That is the housing has an opening through which the display is exposed so that it is viewable by a user. The housing is in at least some embodiments constructed primarily of an opaque material which serves to prevent internal components of the electronic device from being viewed by a user and which also assists in directing external light i.e. light that is outside the housing towards light sensitive internal components such as for example the gesture sensor and in at least some embodiments a camera.

To allow external light to travel from outside the electronic device to the light sensitive gesture sensor housed within the electronic device and or to allow external light to travel from inside the electronic device to outside the electronic device the housing includes one or more windows aligned with the gesture sensor . The window may be a transparent portion of the housing . In the example illustrated two windows are illustrated. A first window is aligned with a sensing element of the gesture sensor and a second window is aligned with a light source of the sensing element .

Referring now to a cross section of the electronic device is illustrated which further illustrates components of the gesture sensor . As shown the housing houses at least some components of the gesture sensor . For example the housing houses a light source and a sensing element associated with the gesture sensor .

The light source and the sensing element cooperate to provide a time of flight sensor . That is the gesture sensor includes a time of flight sensor which includes both the sensing element and the light source .

The time of flight sensor can be configured to emit and receive light. The light is emitted by the light source and is received after being reflected by a nearby object such as a hand at the sensing element . The time between the emission of light and the reception of the reflected light can be accurately measured by the time of flight sensor . For example a processor which is coupled to the time of flight sensor or another associated microprocessor determines the amount of time that lapsed between the emission and reception of the laser light. This amount of time along with the speed of the emitted light is then used by the processor to determine the approximate distance of the object off of which the light reflected. In other words the processor calculates the estimated proximity of the object to the time of flight sensor.

Accordingly the gesture sensor which includes the time of flight sensor operates by monitoring reflected light. That is a light source is periodically triggered e.g. by a processor or another timing component . That is a burst of light is emitted by the light source. The gesture sensor also monitors for the amount of light that is received back at the sensing element of the time of flight sensor . The sensing element is light sensitive. That is the sensing element may generate one or more electric signals responsive to received light. The electric signal indicates the amount of light received at the sensing element . In at least some embodiments the electric signal represents a return signal rate of received light. The return signal rate is a measure of the speed at which light emitted by the light source is received after being reflected at the sensing element . For example it may indicate the number of times the signal sensor detects light per unit time e.g. the number of times a photon is detected and triggers the sensing element per second . A higher return signal rate in a serial measurement generally indicates a closer object. In at least some embodiments the return signal rate may be output from the gesture sensor in MHz.

In at least some embodiments the time of flight sensor is a single photon avalanche diode sensor SPAD . This form of sensor is triggered when a photon hits it. That is when a photon contacts the sensing element of the time of flight sensor the sensor outputs a pulse.

To permit the time of flight sensor to both emit light externally and to receive light which was reflected by an external object the time of flight sensor is aligned with the one or more windows . For example a first window may be aligned with the sensing element and the second window may be aligned with the light source .

The sensing element includes a light sensitive side which may be referred to as a sensing side and a non sensing side which is opposite the sensing side . The non sensing side may in at least some embodiments include one or more contacts or connectors which allow the sensing element to be connected to another component of the gesture sensor and or electronic device such as for example a printed circuit board PCB . The sensing side is sensitive to light e.g. an electrical signal is generated based on light received at the sensing side and is therefore proximate a window . That is the sensing side is nearer the first window than is the non sensing side .

As noted previously the light source is configured to emit a burst of light. In some embodiments the light source may be a light emitting diode LED or a laser. In at least some embodiments the light source may emit infrared IR light. In such embodiments the light source may be referred to as an infrared spectrum light source. As noted above the light source may be controlled by a controller associated with the electronic device and or the gesture sensor such as for example a processor microprocessor or a timing component e.g. a clock . In such embodiments the light source may emit the burst of light only when it is triggered by the controller. The emission of light by the light source may be periodic.

The gesture sensor also includes a barrier disposed within the housing between the light source and the sensing element . The barrier extends from the bottom of the housing to the top of the housing in the example illustrated. The barrier is opaque and prevents or inhibits light from travelling internally from the light source to the sensing element . That is the barrier ensures that the light received at the sensing element has traveled through a path that includes a portion which is external to the housing and that the light has not simply traveled internally from the light source to the sensing element .

The time of flight sensor in at least some embodiments includes at least two signal outputs. More particularly in at least some embodiments the time of flight sensor outputs an electrical signal which indicates proximity of an object such as a hand to the sensing element . For example a distance between the object and the sensing element may be represented in an electrical signal output by the time of flight sensor. The time of flight sensor may also output an electrical signal which represents a signal strength and or late of return of the received light at the sensing element . One or more of these outputs may be provided to a processor for further analysis. More particularly as discussed below a processor may be configured to recognize an air gesture based on one or both of these electrical signals.

In the embodiment of the electronic device includes a single time of flight sensor . From the description which follows it will be appreciated that the electronic device may be able to detect gestures using this single time of flight sensor . That is in at least some embodiments a second time of flight sensor is not required to allow for the gesture recognition. As will be discussed below gesture recognition may be accomplished by creating differing optical characteristics on different sides of the sensing element . For example a first side of the sensing element may have a greater viewing angle than a second side of the sensing element. The first side of the sensing element is in some embodiments a side of the sensing element which is nearest a first device side of the electronic device . Similarly the second side of the sensing element is in some embodiments a side of the sensing element which is nearest a second device side of the electronic device . In the example illustrated the first side and the second side are opposing sides of the sensing element and the first side is left of the second side and may therefore be referred to as a left side and the second side may be referred to as a right side. In other embodiments this notation may be reversed the first side may be a right side and the second side may be a left side. In yet other embodiments the first side may be a top side and the second side a bottom side or conversely the first side may be a bottom side and the second side a top side.

The viewing angle for a first side of the sensing element may be referred to as a first viewing angle and may be defined as the angle between a center line which is generally perpendicular to the sensing element and a first side extreme line . The first side extreme line represents a path near the first side of the sensing element that is furthest from the center line but which still permits light to be received at the sensing element . That is light travelling along the first side extreme line towards the sensing element would be received at the sensing element but light travelling along a path that is angled beyond the first side extreme line would not be received at the sensing element .

Similarly the viewing angle for a second side of the sensing element may be referred to as a second viewing angle and may be defined as the angle between a center line which is generally perpendicular to the sensing element and a second side extreme line . The second side extreme line represents a path near the second side of the sensing element that is furthest from the center axis but which still permits light to be received at the sensing element . That is light travelling along the second side extreme line towards the sensing element would be received at the sensing element but light travelling along a path that is angled beyond the second side extreme line would not be received at the sensing element .

The center line may be viewed in greater detail in and which will be discussed below. The center line generally segments the sensing element into two equal halves. The center line may be referred to herein as a first center line to distinguish between another center line which may be referred to as a second center line which is discussed below with reference to . The second center line is perpendicular to the first center line.

As noted above in at least some embodiments a greater viewing angle may be provided to the sensing element on one of the sides as compared with the other of the sides . For example the first viewing angle may be larger than the second viewing angle . These differing viewing angles may in at least some embodiments be used for gesture detection. More particularly these differing viewing angles may allow the gesture sensor and or the electronic device to distinguish between a swipe in a first direction and a swipe in a second direction .

In the example illustrated both the swipe in the first direction and the swipe in the second direction are performed after an object performing the gesture e.g. a hand is in a position where it is away from the electronic device and where it does not reflect light generated by the light source back to the sensing element . For example the object may initially be in a position not shown where it is to one side of the electronic device . Then the object travels in a motion which is generally parallel to the front side of the electronic device to a position where it reflects light that is emitted by the light source back to the sensing element e.g. the position shown in . Then the object continues beyond the position where it reflects the light emitted by the light source back to the sensing element and ends in a position where it once again does not reflect light emitted by the light source back to the sensing element . The swipe in the first direction is generally characterized by movement of the object e.g. the hand from the first side of the sensing element and the first device side of the electronic device in at least some embodiments to the second side of the sensing element and the second device side of the electronic device in some embodiments . In contrast the swipe in the second direction is generally characterized by movement from the second side of the sensing element and the second device side of the electronic device in at least some embodiments to the first side of the sensing element and the first device side of the electronic device in some embodiments .

In at least some embodiments the gesture sensor and or the electronic device may include one or more light inhibitors . The light inhibitor functions to inhibit block modify and or obstruct light which would otherwise travel from outside the electronic device i.e. from a position external to the housing through the first window of the housing to the sensing element at the sensing side . More particularly in at least some embodiments the light inhibitor creates an asymmetric field of view for the sensing element . That is the light inhibitor causes the first side of the sensing element and the second side of the sensing element to both have different optical characteristics. For example in at least some embodiments the light inhibitor causes the first side and the second side to both be associated with different viewing angles. For example the light inhibitor may cause the first side to be associated with a first viewing angle which is larger than a second viewing angle associated with a second side. That is the light inhibitor s may be oriented to provide a greater viewing angle for the sensing element at the first side as compared with the second side .

Since the light inhibitor s are positioned to interfere with light which would otherwise enter the sensing element via the sensing side the light inhibitor s are positioned relatively nearer the sensing side of the sensing element than the non sensing side . That is the light inhibitor s are closer to the sensing side than to the non sensing side .

Furthermore to allow the first side and the second side of the sensing element to be associated with different optical characteristics the light inhibitor s are asymmetric with respect to the sensing element . More particularly the light inhibitor s may be asymmetric about a first center line of the sensing element . The first center line is a line which is located midway between the first side and the second side of the sensing element . Thus the light inhibitor s create different optical characteristics on the first side as compared with the second side . That is the swipe in the first direction may have different optical characteristics than a swipe in the second direction due to the asymmetric nature the light inhibitor s .

A processor coupled to the time of flight sensor may be configured to identify gestures based on the differing optical characteristics associated with various sides of the sensing element that are caused at least in part by the light inhibitors . For example the processor may be configured to determine that a swipe gesture in the first direction has been performed when an electrical signal generated by the sensing element represents one or more predetermined characteristics associated with the swipe in the first direction . As noted above the swipe gesture in the first direction is characterized by movement of a subject from the first side of the sensing element towards the second side of the sensing element . The one or more predetermined characteristics that may be used to detect a swipe in the first direction may be characteristics that are associated with a portion of the light inhibitor s located relatively closer to the first side of the sensing element than the second side of the sensing element. That is the swipe gesture in the first direction may be detected based on optical characteristics caused by a portion of a light inhibitor that is near the first side of the sensing element e.g. the portion causing the optical characteristics which cause a swipe in the first direction to be detected is adjacent to the first side and or is nearer the first side than the second side .

Similarly the processor may be configured to determine that a swipe gesture in a second direction has been performed when the electrical signal generated by the sensing element represents one or more predetermined characteristics associated with the swipe gesture in the second direction . As noted above the swipe gesture in the second direction is characterized by movement of a subject from the second side of the sensing element towards the first side of the sensing element. The one or more predetermined characteristics associated with the swipe in the second direction include characteristics associated with a portion of the light inhibitors located relatively closer to the second side of the sensing element than the first side of the sensing element. That is the swipe gesture in the second direction may be detected based on optical characteristics caused by a portion of a light inhibitor that near the second side of the sensing element e.g. the portion causing the optical characteristics which cause a swipe in the second direction to be detected is adjacent to the second side and or is nearer the second side than the second first .

Thus in at least some embodiments the processor is configured to distinguish between a swipe in the first direction and a swipe in the second direction using information about the orientation of the one or more light inhibitors .

As will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to in some embodiments the processor may compare features of a leading edge of a gesture curve and a trailing edge of a gesture curve in order to determine whether a swipe gesture in the first direction and or a swipe gesture in a second direction has been performed. The gesture curve is a curve which is generated based on an electrical signal obtained from the sensing element . More particularly the gesture curve is generated based on a return signal rate observed at the sensing element. The leading edge is the portion of the curve that is attributable to the movement of the detected object from a position where it does not reflect light generated by the light source back to the sensing element to a position where it is adjacent to the sensing element and reflects light back to the sensing element. The leading edge has a positive slope. The trailing edge is the portion of the curve that is attributable to the movement of the object from a position where it is adjacent to the sensing element and where it reflects light back to the sensing element to a position where it is does not reflect light generated by the light source back to the sensing element. The trailing edge has a negative slope.

In at least some embodiments the direction of a swipe gesture may be determined based on the leading edge and trailing edge of a gesture curve obtained from the electrical signal. For example the slopes of the leading edge and the trailing edge may be compared. In some embodiments this comparison may be based on the absolute value of each of these slopes. Since the sides of the sensing elements may be associated with different viewing angles the direction of a swipe may be determined based on this comparison. For example the processor may make an assumption that an object performing a gesture travels at approximately the same speed as it passes between the first side and second side of the sensing element. With this assumption in mind the return signal rate obtained from the sensing element should have a lower rate of change for the side associated with the greater viewing angle. Thus if the leading edge has a lower rate of change than the trailing edge then the processor may determine that the swipe was from the side of the sensing element with the larger viewing angle e.g. the first side to the side of the sensing element with the smaller viewing angle e.g. the second side .

It will be appreciated that the gesture curve analysis discussed above may be performed without producing or plotting the gesture curve itself. That is the information about the leading edge and trailing edge that is used to determine the direction of the swipe may be obtained from raw data without plotting the data as a gesture curve.

In some embodiments the ratio of the slope of the leading edge curve to the slope of the trailing edge curve or vice versa could be determined and used to identify a gesture. By way of example the ratio for a swipe in the first direction may in some embodiments be generally the inverse of the ratio for a swipe in an opposite direction i.e. the second direction . Thus the ratio would permit the processor to determine whether a swipe in a first direction or a swipe in a second direction which is opposite the first direction has been performed.

In at least some embodiments the processor may be configured to also recognize a swipe in another direction apart from the first and second direction. For example a swipe in a third direction which is perpendicular to the first and second directions may be detected. Similarly a swipe in a fourth direction which is perpendicular to the first and second directions and which is opposite the swipe in the third direction may be detected in some embodiments. To permit the swipe in the third and fourth directions to be detected in some embodiments the light inhibitor s may be arranged to be asymmetric across a second center line that is midway between third and fourth sides of the sensing element . The light inhibitor s may be arranged such that each swipe is associated with different optical characteristics. For example the ratio of the slope of the leading edge and the slope of the trailing edge of the gesture curve for a swipe in the third direction may be different than the ratio of the slope of the leading edge and the slope of the trailing edge of the gesture curve for a swipe in the other of the directions. Similarly the ratio of the slope of the leading edge and the slope of the trailing edge of the gesture curve for a swipe in the fourth direction may be different than the ratio of the slope of the leading edge and the slope of the trailing edge of the gesture curve for a swipe in the other of the directions.

An example light inhibitor arrangement which may be used to detect swipe in four directions is illustrated in and will be discussed in greater detail below in the detailed discussion of .

The light inhibitor s may take different forms in different embodiments. Generally the light inhibitor s are constructed of a material or design which inhibits light. In some embodiments the light inhibitor s may block interfere with attenuate or otherwise affect light so that at least some light that is emitted by the light source and reflected by a nearby object such as a hand which would otherwise travel unobstructed to the sensing element is affected e.g. is blocked from reaching the sensing element interfered with before reaching the sensing element attenuated before reaching the sensing element etc. .

Since light that is emitted by the light source and reflected by an external object may in at least some embodiments travel through a number of different components before reaching the sensing element the light inhibitor s may be located at different layers of the electronic device . For example in at least some embodiments light that is being reflected by an external object towards the sensing element may travel through one or more windows associated with the electronic device s housing . Thus in at least some embodiments the light inhibitor s may be provided on or by the window . One such embodiment will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .

Similarly in some embodiments light that is being reflected by an external object towards the sensing element may travel through a light guide which is layered between the sensing element and the housing . Thus in some embodiments one or more of the light inhibitor s may be provided on or by the light guide. One such embodiment will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .

Since the light being reflected by the external object towards the sensing element must reach the sensing element in order to be sensed in some embodiments the light inhibitor s may be applied to the sensing element itself. For example the light inhibitor may be an opaque mask or layer applied to the sensing side of the sensing element . That is the light inhibitor may be disposed on a sensor window associated with the sensing element. The sensor window may be the sensing side of the sensing element and is generally transparent to allow light to be received with the sensitive portions of the sensing element.

Referring now to an example of a light inhibitor which is applied to the sensing element is illustrated. illustrates a top view of the sensing element and is generally taken from the perspective of 3 3 of .

As noted above the light inhibitor may be applied to a sensor window associated with the sensing element . The sensor window is generally at the sensing side of the sensing element . The light inhibitor is opaque and may for example take the form of an opaque mask which may be applied to the sensing element with an adhesive.

The light inhibitor of defines an opening through which light may be transmitted to the sensing element . In the example illustrated the light inhibitor defines an opening which is generally circular i.e. which has a circular portion and which has a protrusion at one side which further extends the opening beyond the circle to increase the viewing angle at that side. As noted above the light inhibitor is asymmetric about a first center line of the sensing element . As also noted above the center line is located midway between a first side and a second side of the sensing element .

In the example illustrated the protrusion extends from the circular portion in the direction of the first side of the sensing element thereby increasing the viewing angle for the sensing element at the first side . The protrusion takes the form of a triangle having its apex within the circular portion . Thus the protrusion is in the example illustrated a portion of a triangle.

It will be understood that the specific shape and arrangement of the light inhibitor may differ in some embodiments from that shown in . For example referring now to a further example of a light inhibitor which is applied to a sensor window is illustrated. The light inhibitor of is similar to that of . However as illustrated in the protrusion of the light inhibitor of differs from the protrusion of the light inhibitor of . In the protrusion is generally rectangular in shape.

By way of further example referring now to a further example of a light inhibitor which is applied to a sensor window is illustrated. The light inhibitor of is similar to that of . However as illustrated in the protrusion of the light inhibitor of differs from the protrusion of the light inhibitor of . In the protrusion is triangular in shape but the apex of the triangle is not located within the circular portion. That is the triangular protrusion points away from the circular portion .

It will be appreciated that the light inhibitor that is applied to the sensor window may take other forms apart from those illustrated in .

Referring now to a further example of an electronic device having a light inhibitor is illustrated. The electronic device of has features in common with the electronic device of and the discussion of these features will not be repeated. These features are identified with reference numerals that correspond to those in . Accordingly the features discussed above with reference to may also be included in the electronic device of .

In the electronic device of the light inhibitor is provided in a light guide . The light guide is layered between the sensing element and the housing . More particularly the light guide is adjacent to the sensing side of the sensing element and is also adjacent to the window of the housing of the electronic device . The light guide functions to direct light which travels from outside the electronic device and through the window of the housing to the sensing side of the sensing element. A top view of the light guide is illustrated in .

The light guide may for example be constructed of a clear material such as a clear plastic. In some such embodiments the light guide may be molded into a desired shape. In the embodiment of the light inhibitor is formed in the light guide . More particularly in the example shown the light inhibitor is a prism pattern that is formed in a portion of the light guide . More particularly the light inhibitor is a prism pattern which is formed in a portion of the light guide . As discussed above with reference to the light inhibitor is asymmetric about a center line of the sensing element . In at least some embodiments this asymmetry may be created by including a prism pattern on one side of the center line but not on the other side of the center line. For example the prism pattern may be formed in a portion of the light guide that is relatively closer to the first side of the sensing element than the second side of the sensing element. That is the prism pattern may be associated with the first side of the sensing element and the second side of the sensing element may not be associated with a corresponding prism pattern. As noted above in the discussion of the light inhibitor i.e. the prism pattern in this example embodiment is located in a position in which it will interfere with light which would otherwise pass without interference from the first window of the housing to the sensing element . Thus the light inhibitor i.e. the prism pattern is in this example position between the first window and the sensing element . In the example illustrated in the prism pattern extends the width of the light guide .

The portion of the light guide which includes the prism pattern directs light differently than other portions of the light guide . For example the prism pattern may focus light in a way that is different than non prism portions of the light guide. By affecting light in this way the gesture curve for a swipe which begins at a side of the sensing element that is near the prism will differ from a gesture curve for a swipe which begins at a side of the sensing element that is away from the prism. That is the prism has an optical characteristic which is identifiable on a gesture curve allowing the processor to determine whether a gesture began or ended at the side of the sensing element associated with the prism.

It will be appreciated that the asymmetry in the light guide may in other embodiments not shown be created by having prism patterns in the light guide on both sides of the center line. In such embodiments the prism patterns may differ from one another i.e. the prism pattern on one side of the center line may differ from the prism pattern on the other side of the center line and or the prism patterns may be at different distances from the center line.

Referring now to an example of a top view of a further embodiment of an electronic device will now be described. The electronic device may have features described above with reference to and a cross section of the electronic device of may be the same or a modified version of what is shown in . In the embodiment of however the light inhibitor whose function is described with reference to is provided on the housing . That is the light inhibitor is provided on the housing which houses components of the electronic device such as the time of flight sensor of . More particularly the light inhibitor s may be defined on a window of the housing which allows light from outside the housing to be transferred to the sensing element which is located within the housing . That is the light inhibitor s may be provided on a first window of the housing which is adjacent to the sensing element .

As illustrated in in this embodiment the light inhibitor s may take the form of an opaque pattern. In the embodiment illustrated this opaque pattern takes the form of an opaque line however the opaque pattern may be different in other embodiments. The opaque pattern may be provided for example as a mask or paint which may be applied to the window

As noted in the discussion above the light inhibitor is asymmetric about the center line of the sensing element. The center line bisects the sensing surface of the sensing element into two equal parts. This asymmetry may be created for example by including an opaque pattern on the window at one side of the center line but not at the other side of the center line or by having different opaque patterns on both sides of the center line . For example one side may have a thin line and the other a thick line or multiple lines. Similarly in some embodiments the asymmetry may be created by having a common pattern on both sides of the center line but by spacing these patterns at differing distances from the center line.

As noted above in the discussion of in some embodiments the light inhibitor s may be arranged to permit the electronic device to recognize swipes in more than two directions. For example in some embodiments the light inhibitors may be configured to allow swipes in four directions to be recognized. Referring now to an example of one such embodiment is illustrated.

The embodiment of could be used to allow the processor to also recognize swipes in first second third and fourth directions. The swipe in the first direction may be as described above with reference to .

In the example illustrated the swipe in the first direction the swipe in the second direction the swipe in the third direction and the swipe in the fourth direction are performed after an object performing the gesture e.g. a hand is in a position where it is away from the electronic device and where it does not reflect light generated by the light source back to the sensing element . For example the object may initially be in a position where it is to one side of the electronic device . Then the object travels in a motion which is generally parallel to the front side of the electronic device to a position where it reflects light that is emitted by the light source back to the sensing element . Then the object continues beyond the position where it reflects the light emitted by the light source back to the sensing element and ends in a position where it once again does not reflect light emitted by the light source back to the sensing element .

The swipe in the first direction is generally characterized by movement from the first side of the sensing element and the first device side of the electronic device in at least some embodiments to the second side of the sensing element and the second device side of the electronic device in some embodiments . In contrast the swipe in the second direction is generally characterized by movement from the second side of the sensing element and the second device side of the electronic device in at least some embodiments to the first side of the sensing element and the first device side of the electronic device in some embodiments . The swipe in the third direction and the swipe in the fourth direction are perpendicular to the swipe in the first direction and the swipe in the second direction. The swipe in a fourth direction is in a direction which is opposite the swipe in the third direction. The swipe in the third direction is characterized by a movement that is generally parallel to the device beginning at a point which is nearer a device third side for the electronic device and ending at a point which is relatively farther from the device third side and is relatively nearer a device fourth side .

Similarly a swipe in the fourth direction is characterized by a movement that is generally parallel to the device beginning at a point which is nearer a device fourth side for the electronic device and ending at a point which is relatively farther from the device fourth side and is relatively nearer a device third side .

To permit the swipe in the third and fourth directions to be detected the light inhibitor s may be arranged to be asymmetric across both a first center line and a second center line that is midway between a third side and fourth side of the sensing element . The light inhibitor s may be arranged such that each swipe is associated with different optical characteristics. That is the light inhibitor s provide different light inhibiting properties on each side of the sensing element . The first center line and second center line effectively divide the sensing element into quarters.

In the embodiment of the light inhibitor s include portions associated with first second and third sides of the sensing element . That is a portion of the light inhibitor s may be near a first side of the sensing element another portion may be near a second side of the sensing element and another portion may be near a third side of the sensing element. Optionally in some embodiment a further portion of the light inhibitors may be near a fourth side of the sensing element. The portions associated with each of the sides include differing features to provide optical characteristics unique to the respective sides. By way of example in the embodiment illustrated the light inhibitor s are applied to the window of the housing in the manner described above with reference to . In this embodiment the light inhibitor s associated with each side is different. That is a first pattern is applied to the portion of the window that is nearest the first device side a second pattern is applied to the portion of the window that is nearest the second device side and a third pattern is applied to the portion of the window that is nearest the device third side . Optionally a fourth pattern may be applied to the portion of the window that is nearest the device fourth side . This fourth pattern is optional since the lack of a pattern may be used to create the optical characteristic that is unique to the fourth side. Each of the patterns are different allowing the processor to determine whether a swipe in a first second third or fourth direction has been performed based on the optical characteristic s represented in the electrical signal which is output by the sensing element. That is when a swipe is performed and the leading edge of the gesture curve for the swipe indicates an optical characteristic associated with a particular one of the sides then the processor may determine that a swipe gesture which begins at that side has been performed.

Referring now to example output from a sensing element will now be discussed. provides an example output for a swipe in a first direction and provides an example output for a swipe in the second direction . These outputs may generally be referred to as gesture curves and for the clarity the gesture curve of will be referred to as a first gesture curve and the gesture curve of will be referred to as a second gesture curve .

The gesture curves illustrated provide on their y axes a return signal rate. The return signal rate is output by the sensing element and is a measure of the speed at which light emitted by the light source is received after being reflected at the sensing element . The x axes of these curves are used to illustrate the position of an object such as a hand .

Each curve includes a leading edge and a trailing edge . The leading edge is the portion of the curve that is attributable to the movement of the detected object from a position where it does not reflect light generated by the light source back to the sensing element to a position where it is adjacent to the sensing element and reflects light back to the sensing element. The leading edge has a positive slope. The trailing edge is the portion of the curve that is attributable to the movement of the object from a position where it is adjacent to the sensing element and where it reflects light back to the sensing element to a position where it is does not reflect light generated by the light source back to the sensing element. The trailing edge has a negative slope.

Notably the first gesture curve and the second gesture curve differ. For example the first gesture curve has a leading edge which is steeper than its trailing edge. In contrast the second gesture curve has a trailing edge which is steeper than its leading edge. This difference may for example be caused by a difference in the viewing angle for the sensing element at different sides of the electronic device. That is an asymmetric viewing angle may create this difference in the gesture curves.

By analyzing one or both of the leading edge or the trailing edge of a gesture curve the processor may identify a direction associated with a swipe gesture. For example the slopes of the leading edge and the trailing edge may be compared.

Referring now to an example method for identifying a swipe gesture is illustrated in flowchart form. The method includes features which may be provided by an electronic device such as the electronic device of any one of and . More particularly one or more application or module or processor readable instructions associated with the electronic device such as a contactless gesture interpretation module may contain processor readable instructions for causing a processor associated with the electronic device to perform one or more steps of the method of . That is in at least some example embodiments the electronic device may be configured to perform the method of .

In at least some embodiments one or more of the functions or features of the method of may be performed in whole or in part by another system software application module component or device apart from those specifically listed above.

In some embodiments the method or parts thereof may be performed on a main processor of the electronic device . In other embodiments the method may be performed on a microprocessor or processor that is not the main processor of the electronic device. For example in some embodiments the gesture sensor may be equipped with a microprocessor which may perform the method .

At one or more electrical signals are obtained from a time of flight sensor. As noted in the discussion of above in some embodiments these electrical signals may include a signal rate of return. In some embodiments one or more of these electrical signals indicate proximity of an object such as a hand to the sensing element of the electronic device .

At the processor determines whether a swipe gesture in a first direction has been performed. As noted above this determination may be based on the leading edge and trailing edge of a gesture curve defined in one or more of the electrical signals. More particularly the processor may determine whether the electrical signal generated by the sensing element represents one or more predetermined characteristics associated with a swipe gesture in the first direction. If so then the processor may determine that a swipe gesture in the first direction has in fact been performed. That is at the processor may interpret the gesture as a swipe in the first direction.

If the swipe is not a swipe in the first direction the processor may determine whether it is a swipe in the second direction. At the processor determines whether a swipe gesture in the second direction has been performed. This determination may also be based on the leading edge and trailing edge of a gesture curve defined in one or more of the electrical signals. More particularly the processor may determine whether the electrical signal generated by the sensing element represents one or more predetermined characteristics associated with a swipe gesture in the second direction. If so then the processor may determine that a swipe gesture in the first direction has in fact been performed. That is at the processor may interpret the gesture as a swipe in the first direction.

Optionally in some embodiments before determining that a swipe in the first direction or a swipe in the second direction has been performed the processor may confirm that the gesture curve was not caused by perpendicular movement. That is the processor may confirm that the electrical signal containing the gesture curve was not produced from movement of a hand perpendicularly towards or away from the electronic device . Accordingly in at least some embodiments at and before interpreting the gesture as a swipe in the first direction or a swipe in the second direction the processor may determine based on time of flight data from the time of flight sensor that the electrical signal containing the gesture curve represents parallel movement of a subject with respect to the sensing element as opposed to perpendicular movement . Thus the electronic device may check the stability of the time of flight data to confirm that an object was moved generally parallel to the electronic device.
