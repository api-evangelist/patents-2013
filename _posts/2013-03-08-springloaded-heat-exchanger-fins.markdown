A thermoelectric module is a device which converts a heat differential directly into electrical energy through the Seebeck effect or when operated in reverse converts electrical energy into a heat differential through the Peltier effect. A thermoelectric module generally uses semiconductor p n junctions sandwiched between a pair of flat parallel substrates constructed of a material having relatively low electrical conductivity and high thermal conductivity such as aluminum oxide. Each thermoelectric module includes a hot side the side that absorbs heat and a cold side the side that expels heat. The thermoelectric module is typically mounted between two parallel plates one plate on the hot side of the thermoelectric module and one plate on the cold side of the thermal electric module. The cold side plate generally includes cooling fins and the hot side generally includes heating fins. The heating fins transfer heat from a heat source toward the thermoelectric module and the cooling fins transfer the heat away from the thermoelectric module after the heat has crossed the thermoelectric module. As the cooling fins on the cold side plate and the heating fins on the hot side plate transfer heat across the thermoelectric module the thermoelectric module generates an electric voltage. It is important that the cold side plate and the hot side plate maintain a close thermal contact with the thermal electric module to maximize the heat transfer rate across the thermoelectric module. Maximizing the heat transfer rate across the thermoelectric module maximizes the efficiency and electric output of the thermoelectric module.

A common prior art method for mounting the thermoelectric module between the cold side plate and the hot side plate is to use bolts to connect the plates together with the thermoelectric module compressed in between. Mounting the thermoelectric module between the plates with bolts in this manner results in bending moments on the plates causing the plates to bow apart at the center. The bowing of the plates reduces the thermal contact area between the plates and the thermal electric module thereby decreasing its efficiency. The thickness of the plates could be increased to stiffen the plates against bowing. However increasing the thickness of the plates would increase the thermal resistance of the plates thereby decreasing the heat transfer rate across the thermoelectric module.

In addition to decreasing the efficiency of the thermoelectric module simply compressing the thermoelectric module between the plates with bolts applies non uniform compressional forces to the thermoelectric module. These non uniform compressional forces may cause high pressure regions to develop on the thermoelectric module causing the thermoelectric module to fracture during the assembly process or during operation.

According to the present invention a heat exchanger includes a first plate and a second plate connected to the first plate to define a duct between the first plate and the second plate. At least one elastic cooling fin is disposed inside the duct between the first plate and the second plate. At least one elastic cooling fin exerts a load on the first plate.

In another embodiment of the present invention a heat exchanger fin assembly includes a first plate and a curved fin with a first end and a second end. The first end of the curved fin is disposed on the first plate and a second plate is disposed against the second end of the curved fin. The curved fin exerts a load against the first plate and the second plate.

In another embodiment of the present invention a thermal electric power generator for converting thermal energy into electricity includes a first plate a second plate and a third plate. A thermoelectric module is disposed between the first plate and the third plate. A heating duct is proximate the third plate and a heating fin extends from the third plate into the heating duct. A cooling duct disposed between the first plate and the second plate and a cooling fin elastically compressed between the first plate and the second plate such that the cooling fin pushes the first plate against the thermoelectric module.

The present invention provides a heat exchanger coupled to a thermoelectric module. The heat exchanger includes a first plate a second plate and elastic cooling fins disposed between the first plate and the second plate. The elastic cooling fins are compressed between the first plate and the second plate such that the elastic cooling fins push the first plate against the thermoelectric module to keep the first plate in thermal contact with the thermoelectric module. Cooling air flows between the first plate and the second plate and across the cooling fins.

Screws connect second plate to first plate to define cooling duct . Screws also connect third plate to first plate opposite second plate . Spacers are disposed between first plate and third plate to define gap between first plate and third plate . Screws also connect first plate second plate and third plate to casing such that casing is disposed against third plate opposite first plate . Casing defines heating duct . Cooling fins are disposed inside cooling duct and extend between first plate and second plate . Thermoelectric module is disposed inside gap between and against first plate and third plate . Heating fins are connected to third plate and extend from third plate past casing into heating duct . Electrical conduit is connected to first plate and provides an entry into gap for lead wire and return wire . Lead wire and return wire are electrically connect to thermoelectric module and may connect thermoelectric module as a power source to an electrical circuit. Additionally more than one thermoelectric module may be disposed inside gap and lead wire and return wire may connect thermoelectric modules in parallel or in a series. Cavity port is also connected to first plate and is in fluid communication with gap . Cavity port may include a stem valve and may be used to fill gap with an inert gas such as argon or to evacuate gap . Filling gap with an inert gas protects thermoelectric module and the interfaces between thermoelectric module first plate and third plate against oxidation as heat transfers across thermoelectric module . Preventing oxidation of components in thermal systems is beneficial as oxidation generally increases the thermal resistance of components thereby lowering their thermal conductivity.

Hot gas flows inside heating duct and across heating fins . Hot gas may be generated from a gas fuel or liquid fuel burner disposed inside casing . Heating fins transfer the heat to third plate and third plate transfers the heat to thermoelectric module . The heat travels across thermoelectric module to first plate . As the heat travels across thermoelectric module thermoelectric module produces a voltage difference which generates a current in lead wire and return wire . The heat transfers from first plate to cooling fins . Cooling fins transfer the heat to cool air as cool air flows through cooling duct . A fan may be used to push or pull cool air through cooling duct and across cooling fins . Cooling duct may draw cool air from ambient atmosphere and vent cool air to atmosphere once cool air has traveled across cooling fins and heated. The electric output of thermoelectric module is a function of the heat transfer rate across thermoelectric module . The greater the heat transfer rate across thermoelectric module the greater the electrical output of thermoelectric module . Factors that effect the heat transfer rate across thermoelectric module include the temperature differential between hot gas cool air the thermal resistance of heating fins third plate first plate and cooling fins and the size of the contact area between thermoelectric module and first plate and the contact area between thermoelectric module and third plate .

In prior art assemblies maintaining full thermal contact between thermoelectric modules and adjacent components has been an ongoing problem as thermal expansion and mounting hardware will cause the adjacent components to flex and bend and thereby forming spaces between the adjacent components and the thermoelectric modules. These spaces reduce the contact area between the adjacent components and the thermoelectric modules causing a reduction in the heat transfer rate across the thermal electric modules. As discussed below in the description of cooling fins prevent spaces from forming between thermoelectric module first plate and third plate by ensuring that first plate and third plate remain in full thermal contact with thermoelectric module .

In components of like numbering with the components of are assembled as discussed above with reference to . First side panel and second side panel extend from top panel of second plate and are positioned on top panel opposite one another. Flanges are formed on first side panel and second side panel opposite top panel . Flanges contain holes for receiving screws to connect flanges to first side of first plate . First side panel second side panel and top panel of second plate along with first side of first plate enclose and define cooling duct . Second side of first plate spacers and first side of third plate define and enclose gap . Thermoelectric module is disposed inside gap between second side of first plate and first side of third plate . Cold side of thermoelectric module abuts second side of first plate . Cold side is the side of thermoelectric module that expels heat. Hot side of thermoelectric module abuts first side of third plate . Hot side is the side of thermoelectric module that absorbs heat. In the embodiment of cold side of thermoelectric module may be adhered to second side of first plate by a high temperature adhesive or epoxy such as Pyro Putty to reduce movement of thermoelectric module inside gap . While hot side of thermoelectric module abuts first side of third plate hot side may be mechanically or chemically disconnected from first side to allow shifting between thermoelectric module and third plate as third plate undergoes thermal expansion during operation. Heating fins are connected to second side of third plate and extend from second side past casing into heating duct .

Cooling fins are curved or bowed with a C shaped cross sectional profile that extends between first end and second end . The curved C shaped cross sectional profile allows cooling fins to be elastically compressed and function as springs. Cooling fins are compressed between top panel of second plate and first side of first plate . First end of each cooling fin may be brazed to first side of first plate . While second end of each cooling fin abuts top panel of second plate second end of each cooling fin may be mechanically or chemically disconnected from top panel . Disconnecting cooling fins from top panel allows shifting between cooling fins and second plate as first plate and cooling fins undergo thermal expansion during operation. If cooling fins and top panel were not permitted to shift stress concentrations would build up inside cooling fins and second plate leading to wear and reduce life of cooling fins . Because cooling fins are elastically compressed between first plate and top panel of second plate each cooling fin exerts a reaction load or force against first plate and second plate . First plate is compliant such that first plate may be flexed and pushed by cooling fins . Second plate may be stiff and noncompliant such that second plate backs up and supports cooling fins . During operation as the heat transfers across third plate thermoelectric module and first plate as discussed above in the description of first plate and third plate may undergo thermal expansion. As first plate and third plate thermally expand and contract cooling fins continually push first plate against cold side of thermoelectric module and also continually push hot side of thermoelectric module against third plate . By continually pushing first plate against thermoelectric module cooling fins ensure that first plate is in constant thermal contact with thermoelectric module . Similarly by continually pushing thermoelectric module against third plate cooling fins ensure that third plate is in constant thermal contact with thermoelectric module .

Cooling fins are also evenly distributed across first side of first plate . By evenly distributing cooling fins on first plate cooling fins apply evenly distributed loads across first plate thermoelectric module and third plate . Because cooling fins apply evenly distributed loads cooling fins evenly press first plate against thermoelectric module . With cooling fins evenly pressing first plate against thermoelectric module spaces are unable to develop between first plate and thermoelectric module during assembly or operation of thermal electric power generator . Similarly cooling fins evenly press thermal electric module against third plate preventing spaces from developing between thermoelectric module and third plate . Third plate may also be compliant such that third plate evenly flexes into full contact with thermoelectric module as thermoelectric module presses against third plate . Because cooling fins prevent spaces from developing between thermoelectric module and first plate and thermoelectric module and third plate cooling fins maximize the thermal contact that thermoelectric module shares with first plate and third plate . Maximizing the thermal contact that thermoelectric module shares with first plate and third plate increases the heat transfer rate across thermoelectric module and increases the electrical output of thermoelectric module as discussed above in the description of . By evenly distributing their loads across thermoelectric module cooling fins also prevent stress concentrations from arising in thermoelectric module .

In view of the foregoing description it will be recognized that the present disclosure provides numerous advantages and benefits. For example the present disclosure provides thermal electric power generator with cooling fins and thermoelectric module . Cooling fins evenly press thermoelectric module against its neighboring components to maximize its thermal contact area with those components thereby maximizing the thermal efficiency and electrical output of thermoelectric module . In addition cooling fins press evenly on thermal electric module preventing stress concentrations from arising in thermoelectric module that may damage or shorten the life of thermoelectric module .

Additionally while cooling fins have been describe in the specification in context of thermal electric power generator with thermoelectric module cooling fins may be applied in any electrical chemical or mechanical system that requires heat exchanger fins. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
