title: Display methods for high dynamic range images and user interfaces for the same
abstract: Display methods and interfaces for high dynamic range images. High dynamic range images and corresponding histograms are displayed on a display device. The histogram panel displays low dynamic range and high dynamic range data of the images simultaneously. The low dynamic range and high dynamic range data is brightness level of the image pixels.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 979 503 filed Nov. 5 2007 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 355 030 on Jan. 15 2013 which itself claims priority benefits to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 030 083 filed Jan. 7 2005. Each of the aforementioned related patent applications is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention relates to image display and in particular to display methods for high dynamic range image.

The dynamic range of a scene is expressed by the contrast ratio between its brightest and darkest parts. A low dynamic range image LDR image can be displayed on a standard display device because of its smaller dynamic range. Due to the range limitations of LDR images LDR images cannot represent abundant brightness of real scenes properly. Thus high dynamic range HDR images are necessary. A high dynamic range image HDR image is typically generated by combining multiple LDR images of the same scene taken with different exposures. High dynamic range images are broadly employed in image processing systems. Rather than being displayed on a standard display device directly high dynamic range images require a translation from high dynamic range to low dynamic range for display.

Conventionally an image panel and histogram panel are arranged on a display device such as a screen to display images and corresponding histograms. The conventional histogram panel can only display the brightness of low dynamic range data of the image pixels. is a diagram of an embodiment of a conventional histogram panel. The conventional histogram panel can only display the brightness of low dynamic range data of the image pixels. Thus if an image processing system processes high dynamic range images some image parts cannot be displayed by the conventional histogram panel because of the out of range brightness.

For example if an image processing system comprises an image panel and a conventional histogram panel as shown in an HDR image may be displayed in the image panel and the brightness data of the image pixels is displayed in the corresponding conventional histogram panel . When the displayed image is modified the histogram panel will be difficult to reflect the actual transformed result due to limited input range of histogram panel.

In an exemplary embodiment of display methods for high dynamic range images high dynamic range images and corresponding histograms are displayed on a display device. The histogram panel displays transformed low dynamic range and high dynamic range data of the images simultaneously. The low dynamic range and high dynamic range data are the brightness level of the image pixels.

Display methods for high dynamic range images are provided. An image and a histogram panel are displayed on a screen. The image is a high dynamic range image and the histogram panel displays low dynamic range and high dynamic range data of the image expressed as brightness level of the image pixels. The histogram panel displays a two dimensional histogram comprising a first axis such as X axis to display brightness and a second axis such as Y axis to display pixel counts. The histogram panel changes corresponding histogram of the image when the brightness thereof is adjusted.

When the brightness of the high dynamic range image displayed on the image panel is adjusted the histogram displayed on the histogram panel changes accordingly. The displayed high dynamic range data can be provided for other operations. For example the user interface can be integrated with an image processing system for producing and processing high dynamic range images.

Thus display methods and interfaces of high dynamic range images may potentially resolve the inconvenience of conventional high dynamic range image display methods. The disclosed methods are particularly useful for processing system for high dynamic range images.
