This invention relates to the field of software and more specifically to techniques for implementing intranets and extranets.

The Internet and World Wide Web WWW or the Web have enjoyed widespread success. The Web is a collection of text documents and other resources linked by hyperlinks and universal resource locators URLs usually accessed by web browsers from web servers. The Web is used daily by people to read news listen to music send e mail transact business share information interact with one another and much more.

An intranet is a computer network that uses Internet Protocol IP technology to securely share any part of an organization s information or network operating system within that organization. It is the connection of computer networks in a local area. An intranet can be understood as a private analog of the Internet or as a private extension of the Internet confined to an organization.

Intranets can also be contrasted with extranets. While intranets are generally restricted to employees of the organization extranets may also be accessed by customers suppliers or other approved parties. Extranets extend a private network onto the Internet with special provisions for authentication authorization and accounting.

There is continuing demand for improvements to the Web so that it is faster easier to use encourage participation more accessible to greater numbers of users provide more features and generally address the needs of consumers and customers.

As can be appreciated there is a need for improved techniques of managing web sites including intranets and extranets.

An administrator can use a portal platform to manage social equity for social collaboration features of the web sites. A goal is to encourage users to contribute to an on line community s social activities such as its blogs message boards and wiki pages. The portal platform supports social equity features where users can earn points for their participation. The administrator can specify a counter period where the points accumulated during the last period are reset. This feature can be used to encourage continual participation by the users.

In an implementation the system includes retrieving a listing of social activity where the listing includes a actions each action corresponding to an asset a type of social equity and a number of points extracting assets on a portal web page where each of the assets correspond to a portlet executing on the portal web page based on the listing of social activity associating with each asset a type of social equity and a number of points tracking the assets on the portal web page detecting a first action by a first user with a first asset on the portal web page and incrementing in a social equity points database for the first user a first number of points with a first type.

The method can include after exceeding a threshold resetting in the social equity points database the points associated with the first user. The method can include before the resetting in the social equity points database processing from the listing of social activity threshold values for each type of social equity. The threshold can be a length of time or a number of points. The method can include where resetting is to a zero point value or a non zero point value.

In various implementations the system includes where the first number of points are visible to the first user. The first number of points can be hidden from the first user. The portal web page can be an enterprise portal. The method can include processing the social equity points database to generate a leaderboard. The system can track various types of actions such as adding a blog entry associated with a blog portlet adding a wild entry associated with a wiki portlet or adding a message board entry associated with a message board portlet. The system can include where the listing of social activity is inaccessible to the first user.

In an implementation the system includes collecting actions from users of a portal web platform for each action of the actions determining a corresponding point value and point type from a listing of social activity storing at a social equity points database for each user of the users a point value for each point type and adjusting values stored in the social equity points database according to the determined corresponding point value and point type.

In implementations the system includes generating a summary of values in the social equity points database. The method can include where the summary is accessible by the users.

In an implementation the system includes collecting actions from users of a portal web platform for each action of the actions determining a corresponding point value and point type from a listing of social activity storing at a social equity points database the determined point value by point type adjusting values stored in the social equity points database according to the determined corresponding point value and point type and resetting the values stored in the social equity points database.

The web browser is used to download web pages or other content in various formats including HTML XML text PDF and postscript and may be used to upload information to other parts of the system. The web browser may use uniform resource identifiers URLs to identify resources on the web and hypertext transfer protocol HTTP in transferring files on the web.

A portal platform is generally a software platform for building web sites and web applications. Some specific example of portal platform software includes the Liferay Portal Liferay Social Office Liferay Sync and Liferay Projects by Liferay Inc. See www.liferay.com for more information. All public published content by Liferay to the filing date of this patent application is incorporated by reference along with all other cited references in this application. This published content includes web site pages user guides and manuals white papers and other on line and paper publications and documentation.

The system can include for example Liferay Portal releases 6.1 6.0 4.2 and 5.1 Liferay Social Office release 1.5. Documentation for these releases is available at the Liferay web site and are incorporated by reference.

The system includes a portal server. For example the system s portal server is designed to be a single environment where all of the applications a user needs can run and these are integrated together in a consistent and systematic way. If an application lives or executes or resides outside the portal the portal should be able to consume some resource of the application such as an RSS feed or a subset of functionality in a dashboard application so that the end user can see everything he or she interacts with at a glance e.g. on the portal page without navigating to other pages .

To achieve this application functionality within the system resides in fragments of the page called portlets. Portlets are web applications that run in a portion of a web page. The system includes a portlet container that aggregates portlets on particular pages and displays them to users. In this way one or many applications can reside on a page and users can at the administrator s discretion arrange them however they like. For example the user can modify the position of a portlet with respect to another portal or from one position on the portal page to another position.

Portlet applications like servlet applications are defined by a Java standard which various portal server vendors have implemented. The Java standard defines the portlet specification. A JSR 168 or JSR 286 standard portlet should be deployable on any portlet container which supports those standards. Portlets are placed on the page in a certain order by the end user and are served up dynamically by the portal server.

Portal applications generally come in two flavors 1 multiple portlets which only provide small amounts of functionality individually but are aggregated by the portal server into a larger application or 2 whole applications which reside in only one application window. The choice is up to the application designers. This means that developers have to worry about what happens inside the portlet itself. The portal server handles building out the page as it is presented to users.

Portlets are not difficult to build and Java standard portlets can be written by any Java developer with experience in writing web applications. The system can include a plugins software development kit that assists designing new portlet projects as well as a development environment based on Eclipse.

The system can include social collaboration features users need to do virtual teamwork. Users can coordinate calendars and schedules write shared blog entries work together on documents discuss issues in forums document everything in a wiki and more. The underlying theme is that all discussion and collaboration is kept with the asset. This means that the asset whether that be a document a thread a blog entry or a wiki article is the star around which all of the discussion and collaboration orbits.

Trying to collaborate on assets through e mail or server shares works up to a certain point but then it fails because it is a backwards way of doing the work. The asset in that scenario becomes secondary and the wrapper e mail or the share becomes the primary target of the work. So instead of concentrating on the asset which the team is trying to produce the focus turns to the wrapper.

In the case of a shared folder a user might manually rename documents according to a numbering scheme so other users can tell which is the latest that is until a user forgets to do so or until a user accidentally overwrites the latest document. In the case of e mail users try to navigate huge threads while passing an asset back and forth until a user forgets to reply all or until a user starts a new thread and maybe forgets to put the whole list on the thread .

Working in the mediums of shared folders or e mail puts the focus on working with the wrapper not the asset. And so what happens is the asset gets lost because they are forced to focus on the wrapper instead of the asset. With the system users will be free to concentrate on their assets the system gets out of the way of users so that it s a simple matter for users to work together.

Portals can include a range of functionality and a single portal can include one or more of the functions described following 

Web Platform. A portal is generally a software platform for building web sites and web applications. Using such a platform a portal administrator can manage one or more web sites of an organization. In addition to managing external web sites the portal platform can manage intranets and extranets.

A portal platform can have multiple features that make them appropriate for a wide array of web applications. Some common uses for a portal include a web sites that present different pages depending on a user s login e.g. whether the user is logged in b web sites that present different depending on the user s role e.g. role as a customer employee or partner c web sites that integrate multiple existing web application e.g. ERP portal has product alerts inventory and sales applications and e web sites that allow groups of individuals to collaborate through applications on content or with documents.

A portal platform has tools making it easier for users to build web pages and web sites by assembling portlets or gadgets onto a portal page. Portal web sites combine a theme e.g. header footer and common look and feel a set of pages navigation e.g. menu bar and a set of portlets and gadgets. Administrators can build pages without coding by reusing existing portlets and gadgets.

Portals make it easy to build web sites that show different content depending on whether or not the person is logged in. For example a bank website may feature a set of pages describing its services special offers and contact information that are accessible to all however after a customer login additional content may be available such as account information bill payment loans and so forth.

Portals additionally simplify the development of web sites that display different data depending on a user s role. For instance a bank website may feature anonymous and authenticated logged in pages but can additionally have different pages available for various customer types. A standard account can have basic services and pages while business customers can have additional pages defined.

In addition portals allow end users to define pages and add content to their pages using predefined portlets or gadgets. They can also define who can access their pages. Team members can then collaborate together within their community site.

Once it is developed a web site may be made available in multiple languages and from multiple platforms e.g. smartphones tablets other computing devices . The portal platform provides a method to simplify the development and management of pages for each type of end user.

Web Content Management System. A portal can include a full workflow enabled web content management system. Many portal web sites include a great deal of content that requires regular updates. These updates are often accomplished by nontechnical content contributors and need to be approved by content approvers in a workflow approval process.

Portals with web content management can additionally have a workflow approval process to allow some people to edit content which is approved by others before being published. For example a web site having an advertisement on the side of the page could add content via a user interface UI editor. If changes to the advertisement are desired a portal content contributor can log in make the edit and save the changes. If the individual is not approved to publish content changes without review the system will route the update to a content approver.

Portals can also serve as a repository for documents. Similar to content documents can be added to the repository and made available through the web interface or web site. For example individuals can publish documents into a central repository and have them be made available to portal users in a central library upon their login.

Integration Platform. Portals can integrate various existing applications into a single unified user experience. Portals enabled enterprises to pull together information and applications into one web site where users based on role would have quick access to all content specific to their role.

Enterprises often have a very large number of web sites and web applications that individual users regularly access. One method to improve the user experience and improve overall user productivity is to aggregate these various existing websites and applications into a single portal.

Integrations may also include external systems. Enterprise resource planning ERP systems can be integrated into a portal dashboard showing status and alerts. Rather than link to each system a portal would include one or more portlets showing data from the back end system.

Additionally portals can integrate various web sites into a single unified website. For example an enterprise may have an anonymous website customer website partner website and an employee website.

Collaborative Platform. Portals also allow the development of collaborative websites for teams and an entire enterprise.

Team Collaboration. The portal ability to allow individuals to create their own communities empowers teams to create a web area and assign a set of collaborative tools e.g. blog wiki calendar tasks alerts doc sharing to the group. An individual can create or join one or more communities and organize all collaboration within that community.

Organizational Collaboration. Portals are also capable of supporting an entire enterprise for collaboration. As various collaboration tools are implemented they can be made available to teams through the portal s modular design capability e.g. add an additional portlet to the system and make available to community owners . As teams collaborate they input a wide range of resources that can be leveraged by other teams throughout the enterprise.

Social Collaboration. Although teams can be formed by formal organizational roles they can also be formed by informal roles. Portals enable these teams to join together. For example a team of experts in various areas of a company can friend each other and track various projects they are working on individually. Furthermore they can come together and form their own ad hoc community for a specific project. Social features such as social equity rating friending presence internal messaging and friend activity walls allow these informal teams to easily collaborate.

Social Platform. A portal platform provides tools for building web applications web sites and portals but it can additionally be used for a new category of web applications called social applications. A social application is a web application that additionally leverages social identity data and features or services.

Nearly any web application can also be built as a social application increasing the productivity of users. Some features to implement social applications include leveraging social identity by adding it to formal identity leveraging social data by expanding data scope leveraging existing social features and services in social applications a container e.g. OpenSocial and centralized social identity repository.

Enterprises often implement an enterprise wide systems architecture that simplifies access management. Applications are defined to access user identity from a central repository while Identity Management software is used to update this information. This type of architecture simplifies the management of a large and changing number of users that are accessing an equally large and changing number of applications. It also allows auditing and compliance as all accounts are centrally managed and all access can be centrally audited.

Standard web applications can be developed to leverage a formal identity with several methods e.g. simple access control node specific access control role based content delivery or even workflow access . However users can be identified by more than their formal defined from the top down identity they can also be identified by their social identity. Social identity is an individual s self identified friends and groups or communities.

For example a calendar application would allow Bob to create events that he can see however Bob cannot see Steve s events and vice versa. If Bob is accessing a social application for example as shown in he can see data that is specific to himself as well as information that is specific to all members in project Y. For instance a team calendar would allow all members to create events and enable individuals to see events created by all members. Expanding data scope allows a self defined group of individuals to work on an application either as a team or as individuals.

Social applications can be developed using existing social features or services available in a social application platform. For example a social application could include an existing shared document library RSS subscription service or wiki. A platform can provide many applications and features with collaborative capabilities and can be combined into the use case for the application in development. These services can be grouped into categories.

A collaboration services category includes wiki blog forums doc sharing repository messaging calendaring tasks unified communications and others. A user services category includes RSS subscriptions and alerts tracebacks user ratings equity presence and workflow. A portal services category includes aggregation modular app support RBAC RBCD user personalization type 1 layout type 2 attributes delegation and web content management.

More than simply adding links each can become a service within a social application. A portal s ability to build an application from a set of modules where features are grouped into one or more web pages helps to make the application customizable while simplifying the growth of the application s feature set over time.

Social applications can each implement their own social repository or leverage a centralized repository for social identity. The platform can implement OpenSocial which specifies both a method to run gadgets and widgets as well as a common method to store and access social identity. This allows enterprises to use the platform as an authoritative source for social identity information. A single platform installation in an enterprise allows users to create a profile page develop a friend network create and manage new communities or join other communities. This repository of social data can then be used by other applications installed into the same platform portal.

OpenSocial is a public specification that defines a component hosting environment container and a set of common application programming interfaces APIs for web based applications. More information for OpenSocial can be found at www.opensocial.org and all public published content made available at this web site before the filing date of this patent application is incorporated by reference.

Additionally because the system can leverage the OpenSocial standard and because the system externalizes the definition of the friend network a single platform implementation can be leveraged as the master repository for social networking data. Applications that also support other container standards e.g. OpenSocial can point at this platform implementation and leverage its master social identity repository. Enterprises that implement this method will be able to develop a single identity management repository for social data enabling a single source for collaborative definitions and auditing .

With a portal platform a web administrator can add social equity features to the web sites including for example intranets and extranets being managed. Social equity relates to techniques of rewarding users for their contributions in an on line community. It is generally desirable for an organization to have its users actively participate in a community and giving users credit for their contributions. For example these rewards may include assigning points for actions or particular activities performed by the users.

Using the portal platform the administrator can select or indicate which activities to reward how many points to assign to a particular activity and specify and managed other parameters associated with social equity for users and web sites. Some activities that can be rewarded include logging in time spent on the site contributing to a forum asking or posting a question answering a question maintaining and updating a blog and others. For a company by encouraging active participating in the community employees can get to know each other share ideas be more communicative with each other even if at different locations or time zones and work better together as a team.

In an implementation the system can also define different types of points which match the type of activity a user has done. For example the system can have three types of points contribution participation and popularity. These different types of points capture different aspects of a user s activity. For example participation points can be given to users who create assets in the portal e.g. creates a wiki adds a comment or actions . Contribution points can be given to users who perform actions on a created asset. For example users commenting on a blog updating a blog or other activities can gain additional contribution points. Popularity points can be granted by how often other users access your asset. For example if user A creates a blog that is regularly viewed by many users each view can help gain user A additional popularity points.

A single activity can grant the user points in one or more categories and different values for each category. For example when a user updates a blog the user can get 1 participation point 0 contribution points and 0 popularity points.

The parameters for social activity managed by an administrator can be through a settings screen selection menu parameters file or other interface. For example the administrator can edit or specific parameters in a social activity parameters file.

For example the social.activity.counter.period.length parameter indicates a period or length of time during which social activity is tracked and then reset. This period can be set to any number e.g. 15 days 30 days month 60 days 90 days or 1 year the administrator desires. A number can indicate a number of days while a keyword month is used to specify a month period.

A goal of an organization is to encourage users to continually or regularly contribute even if they might have contributed greatly in the past. The organization does not want users who have accumulated a large number of social equity points to no longer participate e.g. coast after building up a big lead . Using this social equity counter period this allows the administrator to reset the social equity points to 0 or other baseline value periodically to continue to encourage people to participate. The person who contributed the most during each period may be recognized and then a new period beings where each user has a chance to become the new leader.

This also reduces the chance that a user attempts to artificially gain points in the system at the end of a points period. For example since the system can limit the amount of points a user gains for a particular time period e.g. a day two days an hour a week or other time period a user that is trying to inflate their points in the system at the end of a certain period e.g. to meet a certain amount of points before an internal review or other event is prevented from doing so.

For each asset there are a number of participate points contribution points and popularity points that can be assigned. For example for adding a blog a user is given X1 participation points and Y1 contribution point. The parameters X1 and Y1 are specified by the administrator by using drop down boxes of the graphical user interface. In this example 5 is selected for the participation points and 0 for the contribution points.

In an implementation the system does not allow users to see how many points each activity or asset completion results in. This encourages users to engage in the entire system instead of engaging only in specific assets to gain more points For example this can be accomplished by a blind points system where the exact number of points and the other additional criteria for each point as described elsewhere is prevented access by the users.

The administrator can also specify a limit for a particular activity so that after so many points have been accumulated for one activity the user no longer receives credit for that activity. This serves to encourage users to participate in more than just one activity. The limit can be made to apply for a certain time period such as time a day or other period of time. The administrator enters information on the social activity screen and selects the save button to save any changes.

In an implementation the system can detect user operations with the portal through an asset or other object using one or more various methods. This can occur at various stages of the portal operation process. One method is where when a user interacts with a portlet the portlet transmits the user s interaction back to the portal where the system determines what points are associated. Another method is where when a user interacts with a portlet the portlet transmits the user s interaction to a separate destination so that the system can assign points associated with the action.

In an implementation the system rewards different achievements badges pins rewards symbols medallions markers or other classifications depending on their points in the system. For example a user that contributes but has been deemed by the community to have low value contributions a Rebel badge. Different badges can be created and the criteria for each badge changed depending on what an administrator of a portal believes would encourage more valuable feedback to the portal. These badges can be displayed on the profiles of users who have obtained them.
