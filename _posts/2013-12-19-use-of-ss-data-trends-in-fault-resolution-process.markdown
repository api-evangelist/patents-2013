The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to contract number FA8650 09 D 2923 0012 between the United States Air Force and United Technologies Corporation.

The present disclosure relates generally to gas turbine engines and more particularly to systems and methods for resolving fault in a gas turbine engine.

A goal of gas turbine engine fault diagnostics is to accurately detect isolate and resolve critical faults in a gas turbine engine. When a fault occurs in a gas turbine engine it is difficult to identify the fault because the effects of the fault on the engine may not be readily apparent or unique in terms of their source. Typically fault resolution has been performed by engine maintenance personnel or maintainers who utilize static punch list checklists documented in maintenance books.

Based on the instructions and troubleshooting trees in the maintenance books the maintainers then examine each part of the engine to try to determine which part is the root cause of the problem. This may sometimes be a lengthy trouble shooting process. Furthermore more steps may be executed and more parts may be replaced than needed in order to fix the problem.

Accordingly there exists a need to provide a system and method that will ensure the most streamlined fault resolution instructions which can reduce the time it takes for troubleshooting the number of unnecessary replaced parts as well as the number of unscheduled engine removals.

According to one embodiment of the present disclosure an automated method for resolving a fault in an engine is disclosed. The method may comprise providing a reasoner module for recommending a set of maintenance actions to resolve the fault in the engine inputting steady state performance data from the engine into the reasoner module and using the reasoner module to recommend a set of maintenance actions based at least in part on the steady state performance data.

In a refinement the method may further comprise using the reasoner module to compare the steady state performance data to desired engine performance patterns and using the reasoner module to provide a set of maintenance actions based at least in part on the comparison of steady state performance data to the desired engine performance patterns.

In a related refinement the method may further comprise displaying the comparison of steady state performance data to the desired engine performance patterns as a percentage of similarity between the steady state performance data and the desired engine performance patterns.

In another refinement the method may further comprise inputting engine fault codes into the reasoner module and using the reasoner module to provide a set of maintenance actions based at least in part on the engine fault codes.

In a related refinement the method may further comprise inputting transient data from the engine into the reasoner module and using the reasoner module to provide a set of maintenance actions based at least in part on the transient data.

In another related refinement the method may further comprise inputting maintainer observations into the reasoner module and using the reasoner module to provide a set of maintenance actions based at least in part on the maintainer observations.

In another related refinement the method may further comprise providing a connectivity matrix linking the steady state performance data engine fault codes transient data and maintainer observations to maintenance actions.

In another related refinement the method may further comprise using the reasoner module to rank the set of maintenance actions in order of importance.

In another refinement the method may further comprise using the reasoner module to identify trends based on the steady state performance data.

In a related refinement the method may further comprise using the reasoner module to match the steady state performance data trends to desired engine performance patterns.

The non transitory computer readable storage medium may comprise instructions for receiving a plurality of input data including steady state performance data and providing a set of maintenance actions based on the plurality of input data.

In a refinement the non transitory computer readable storage medium may further comprise instructions for relating the steady state performance data to desired engine performance patterns and recognizing steady state performance data trends based on the relation of the steady state performance data to desired engine performance patterns.

In a related refinement the non transitory computer readable storage medium may further comprise instructions for creating a connectivity matrix configured to connect the steady state performance trends to maintenance actions.

In another related refinement the non transitory computer readable storage medium may further comprise instructions for updating the connectivity matrix using the plurality of input data and the provided set of maintenance actions.

In another refinement the non transitory computer readable storage medium may further comprise instructions for ranking the set of maintenance actions.

In another refinement the plurality of input data may further include engine transient data fault codes and maintainer observations.

According to yet another embodiment of the present disclosure a fault resolution system for a gas turbine engine is disclosed. The fault resolution system may comprise at least one computer processor operatively configured to receive steady state performance data from the gas turbine engine and recommend a set of maintenance actions to resolve fault in the gas turbine engine based at least in part on the steady state performance data.

In a refinement the at least one computer processor may be operatively configured to receive engine transient data and engine fault codes from the gas turbine engine and observations from a maintainer and recommend the set of maintenance actions based at least in part on the engine transient data engine fault codes and maintainer observations.

In another refinement the at least one computer processor may be operatively configured to produce a connectivity matrix linking the steady state performance data engine transient data engine fault codes and maintainer observations to maintenance actions.

In yet another refinement the at least one computer processor may be operatively configured to rank the set of maintenance actions in an order best suited to resolve the fault in the engine.

These and other aspects and features of the disclosure will become more readily apparent upon reading the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Although various features are disclosed in relation to specific exemplary embodiments of the invention it is understood that the various features may be combined with each other or used alone with any of the various exemplary embodiments of the invention without departing from the scope of the invention.

While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions certain illustrative embodiments thereof will be shown and described below in detail. It should be understood however that there is no intention to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications alternative constructions and equivalents along within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to the drawings and with specific reference to in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure an exemplary gas turbine engine is shown. The gas turbine engine may generally comprise a compressor section where air is pressurized a combustor downstream of the compressor section which mixes and ignites the compressed air with fuel and thereby generates hot combustion gases a turbine section downstream of the combustor for extracting power from the hot combustion gases and an annular flow path extending axially through each. Gas turbine engine may be used on an aircraft for generating thrust or power or in land based generators for generating power as well.

Turning now to with continuing reference to an exemplary fault resolution system according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. Fault resolution system may be used to resolve faults in the gas turbine engine of . Examples of faults or symptoms may be unusually high or low temperatures unusually high or low pressures leaks etc. Fault resolution system may comprise a reasoner module for recommending a set of maintenance actions based on different types of data acquired from the engine and input into the reasoner module . Reasoner module may comprise any non transitory computer readable storage medium such as for example a computer processor. Input data such as engine fault codes engine transient data and steady state performance data may be stored in an engine control unit of the gas turbine engine and subsequently downloaded to the fault resolution system . In addition to input data received from the engine fault resolution system may also receive input data from other sources such as maintainer observations or information that a maintainer or operator of the engine may observe.

Engine fault codes may be set during in flight engine operation when a fault occurs. After downloading the fault codes to the fault resolution system fault codes may be sent to parser module which changes the fault codes into allowable input data for the reasoner module . Engine transient data may be transient data collected by sensors control logic or other parts in the engine before and after the fault occurs and fault code is set. After downloading the fault codes to the fault resolution system transient data may be sent to parser module and to an engine algorithm module in order to change the transient data into allowable input data for the reasoner module .

Steady state performance data may be collected by the engine control unit. For example when the engine satisfies stable operation criteria during take off a steady state performance data point is captured. The steady state performance data point may contain data about different parameters such as data from sensors and flight condition information. Exemplary sensor data may include data detected from pressure transducers such as at the engine inlet compressor exit and turbine exhaust rotor speeds on high and low speed rotors thermocouples in the turbine main engine fuel flow fan and compressor variable vane position and or light off detector signals. Exemplary flight condition information may include power level angle altitude and Mach number. Steady state performance data may comprise a set of data points captured at the same exact time with the same exact throttle position during take off over a series of flights. After downloading the steady state performance data to the fault resolution system steady state performance data may be sent to a parser module output file module and a data processing module which may also be in communication with a data de coder module in order to change the steady state performance data into allowable input data for the reasoner module .

Reasoner module may compare the steady state performance data to desired engine performance patterns. For example reasoner module may take the set of data points captured over the series of flights and identify steady state performance trends based on a plot of the data points over time. Reasoner module may then compare the steady state performance trends to desired engine performance patterns to identify emerging engine issues. As shown in reasoner module may display the comparison of steady state performance data to desired engine performance patterns as a percentage of similarity between the two. Based on the percentage the maintainer can identify whether certain parameters of the steady state performance data are trending toward the desired engine performance pattern. For example a higher percentage for one parameter may indicate to the maintainer that the parameter is on its way to trend outside an acceptable error band.

Reasoner module takes the different input data engine fault codes engine transient data steady state performance data and maintainer observations and recommends a set of maintenance actions to resolve the fault in the engine . Reasoner module may include as shown in a database and artificial intelligence module to provide a ranked task list ranking the set of maintenance actions in an order of importance best suited to resolve the fault. More specifically as shown in a connectivity matrix links the engine fault codes engine transient data steady state performance data and maintainer observations to maintenance actions. The connectivity matrix which is associated with the database contains relational data between maintenance actions best suited to fix the fault and the input data associated with the health of the engine . The connectivity matrix may display a 1 to indicate a relationship between the input data and the maintenance action and a 0 to indicate no relationship between the input data and the maintenance actions. If for example a significant amount of input data were related to a certain maintenance action then that maintenance action would have a higher ranking in the outputted task list .

Updates to the fault resolution system may be made either by the system itself or by maintenance personnel. The artificial intelligence module may automatically update the reasoner module and connectivity matrix using the input data and ranked task list . In addition as shown in an administration tool may allow maintainers to manage and update the connectivity matrix by adding or deleting fault code references related to the steady state performance data. The administration tool may also allow maintainers to enter their observations of the engine as a source of input data to the fault resolutions system .

Turning now to with continued reference to a flow diagram outlining an automated method for resolving fault in the gas turbine engine is shown according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. At a first step the reasoner module is provided for recommending a set of maintenance actions to resolve fault in the engine. At a second step the engine fault codes fault codes engine transient data steady state performance data and maintainer observations are input into the reasoner module . At a next step the reasoner module is used to provide the connectivity matrix is linking the input data the engine fault codes fault codes engine transient data steady state performance data and maintainer observations with maintenance actions. At a final step the reasoner module outputs a ranked list of maintenance actions based on the input data and results of the connectivity matrix .

From the foregoing it can be seen that the teachings of this disclosure can find industrial application in any number of different situations including but not limited to gas turbine engines. Such engines may be used for example on aircraft for generating thrust or in land marine or aircraft applications for generating power.

The disclosure described provides an automated system and method for resolving fault in a gas turbine engine. The disclosed fault resolution system and method utilizes steady state performance data which has not been applied in the prior art. The use of steady state performance data further isolates the root cause of the engine fault thereby resulting in a more sophisticated troubleshooting tool to resolve engine fault. Furthermore the disclosed system and method provides a connectivity matrix which automatically links the different classes of evidence or input data to a set of maintenance actions thereby resulting in more streamlined instructions to a maintainer. By providing more sophisticated and streamlined fault resolution instructions to a maintainer the amount of maintenance steps performed to resolve a fault the time it takes for troubleshooting the number of unnecessary replaced parts and the occurrence of unscheduled engine removals are all significantly reduced.

While the foregoing detailed description has been given and provided with respect to certain specific embodiments it is to be understood that the scope of the disclosure should not be limited to such embodiments but that the same are provided simply for enablement and best mode purposes. The breadth and spirit of the present disclosure is broader than the embodiments specifically disclosed and encompassed within the claims appended hereto.
