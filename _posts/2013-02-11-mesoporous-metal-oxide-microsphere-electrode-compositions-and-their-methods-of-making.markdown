Advanced energy storage systems such as lithium ion batteries are important approaches to mitigate energy shortage and global climate warming issues that the world is currently facing. High power and high energy density are essential to batteries for applications in electric vehicles stationary energy storage systems for solar and wind energy as well as smart grids. Because conventional lithium ion batteries are inadequate to meet these needs advanced materials with high capacity and fast charge discharge capability are desirable for next generation lithium ion batteries. Titanium dioxide TiO and various polymorphs anatase rutile and TiO B bronze have been widely investigated as lithium ion battery anode materials due to their advantages in terms of cost safety and rate capability. In particular the polymorph of TiO B has shown a favorable channel structure for lithium mobility which results in fast charge discharge capability of a lithium cell. It has been identified that the lithium intercalation in TiO B features a pseudocapacitive process rather than the solid state diffusion process observed for anatase and rutile. Theoretical studies have uncovered that this pseudocapacitive behavior originates from the unique sites and energetics of lithium absorption and diffusion in TiO B structure. As a result TiO B nanoparticles nanotubes nanowires and nanoribbons have been reported as anode materials with good rate performance for lithium ion batteries. These nanomaterials displayed attractive battery performance however they also have some disadvantages e.g. poor electronic conduction network due to aggregation of nanopowders loss of particle connection during cycling and low packing density.

Mesoporous materials LiFePOand TiO with micrometer sized particles were found to be able to overcome these shortcomings yet still maintain the advantages of nanomaterials. The properties of mesoporous materials ensure high contact area between electrolyte and electrode short diffusion distances for Li transport and good accommodation of strain during cycling. The general concern for mesoporous materials is the long transport distance of electrons in micrometer sized particles. Conductive carbon and RuOcoatings have thus been employed to improve the high rate performance of lithium storage in mesoporous TiOmaterials.

However even without conductive coatings mesoporous anatase materials have shown high capacity and good rate performance. It is believed that the sintered nanograins in mesoporous materials could form a facile electronic transport path because of the accumulation of electrons at the grain grain interface. On the other hand micrometer sized materials with a spherical morphology are actually the optimal material morphology in conventional electrode fabrication art because microspheres have high packing density and good particle mobility to form a compact electrode layer. These features are beneficial to attain high volumetric energy and power density as well as uniform electrode layers. Therefore it is highly desirable to develop a mesoporous electrode material such as a mesoporous TiOelectrode that could combine the advantages of the TiO B polymorph mesoporous structure and spherical morphology that has a high capacity and fast charge discharge capabilities. Additionally it is desirable to develop a simplified and economic approach to form the mesoporous electrode material.

Specifically one particular method of formation of a mesoporous TiO B microsphere structure is described in the example section below.

In certain embodiments the mesoporous microsphere composition is prepared by using one of aerosol pyrolysis spray drying freeze drying or plasma processing. In one embodiment an aerosol pyrolysis technique such as shown in is used to produce a titania silica powder for the mesoporous microsphere composition. In such a process the titania template may be combined with a soluble inorganic precursor in water and or organic solvents to form a solution. Examples of soluble inorganic precursors include nitrates acetates sulfates acetylacetonates and trifluoroacetates. The solution may enter the aerosol pyrolysis system at the aerosol generator and may be carried by a carrier gas into a furnace to undergo pyrolysis to form titania or titania silica composite spheres. In certain embodiments the titania solution comprises titanium IV bis ammonium lactate dihydroxide solution with colloidal silica 30 wt LUDOX HS 30 .

In some embodiments the carrier gas may be an inert gas. The carrier gas may comprise nitrogen.

In some embodiments the furnace temperature for the pyrolysis reaction may be between 100 700 C. Downstream of the furnace the aerosol pyrolysis system may have a filter or separation unit to separate the desired titania composite powder from any light ends or fines. The carrier gas may be also be removed through an exhaust stream and controlled by an aspiration pump and valve downstream of the filter unit which may help increase the flow rate and reduce the residence time inside the furnace.

After formation of a metal silica e.g. titania silica powder the silica template may be removed by refluxing with a basic solution e.g. sodium hydroxide in order to etch the silica and sodium ions into the metal oxide structure. The method may further comprise washing the etched powder with an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid to remove the silicate residue from the pores and exchange the sodium ions with protons. The method may further comprise heat treating the hydrated metal oxide at an elevated temperature e.g. 400 500 C. in flowing argon gas to form the mesoporous metal oxide microsphere structure.

In another embodiment where no silica precursor is combined with the metal precursor there is no refluxing washing or heat treatment step required. Such procedures may offer a simplified and economic approach to forming the mesoporous microsphere composition without added complexity.

In some embodiments batteries for grid storage applications may be formed. In other embodiments batteries for vehicle applications may be formed. In yet other embodiments batteries for military applications may be formed. In yet other embodiments batteries for portable electronic devices may be formed. In some embodiments batteries for medical device applications may be formed. In certain embodiments batteries for standard cell size battery applications may be formed.

In this example mesoporous TiO B microspheres were formed and tested in a lithium ion battery for their performance characteristics.

A titania silica composite precursor was prepared by a template assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method. Colloidal silica 30 g 30 wt. LUDOX HS 30 Aldrich was added into titanium IV bis ammonium lactato dihydroxide solution 200 mL 0.25 M Aldrich under stirring. The mixed solution was nebulized into small droplets by an ultrasonic atomizer 2.4 MHz Sonaer Ultrasonics . Flowing nitrogen gas carried the droplets through a tube furnace at 600 C. The titania silica composite powders were then collected in a water bubbling system. The powders were then refluxed in sodium hydroxide solution 100 ml 8 M Aldrich at 100 C. for 3 days in order to etch silica and insert sodium ions into titania. The sample was washed by hydrochloride acid 1 M to remove silicate residue from the pores and exchange sodium ions with protons. The hydrated sample HTiO.HO was then heat treated at a temperature between 400 C. and 500 C. in a flowing argon gas for an hour to form HTiOand TiO B respectively.

X ray diffraction XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D5005 diffractometer using Cu K radiation. Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern was performed using the General Structure Analysis System GSAS software. Thermogravimetry Differential Scanning calorimetry TG DSC was conducted in a temperature range of 25 1000 C. and in an argon flow atmosphere with a Netzsch STA 409 PC thermal analyzer. The particle size distribution was measured using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer. Nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained using a TriStar surface area porosity analyzer at 77 K. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer Emmett Teller BET method. The pore size distribution was calculated by the Barret Joyner Halenda BJH method. The microstructural characterizations of mesoporous TiO B were performed using a Hitachi HF 3300 S TEM instrument that was operated at 300 kV.

The electrodes were fabricated by a conventional coating method. A slurry consisting of the as synthesized active material 70 wt. Super S carbon black 15 wt. and polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF 15 wt. in N methyl 2 pyrrolidone NMP was uniformly spread onto a Cu foil. The active material loading was 1 2 mg cm. The electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 C. overnight before transferring into an Argon filled glove box VAC OMNI LAB . Coin cells CR2032 were fabricated using lithium metal as the counter electrode Celgard 2325 as the separator and LiPF6 1 M in ethylene carbonate dimethyl carbonate diethyl carbonate EC DMC DEC 1 1 1 vol. as the electrolyte. The cells were tested using an Arbin BT2000 charger and a Princeton Applied Research VersaSTAT 4 potentiostat. In order to detect the structure stability of TiO B material after cycling the cycled cell was disassembled to get the electrode. After washed in DMC for three times and dried in vacuum for overnight the electrode was sent for XRD test.

The evolution of the crystal structure during the synthesis can be observed by thermogravimetry differential scanning calorimetry TG DSC curves and the XRD patterns of the intermediates. The DSC curve shown in implies four phase transition regions at various temperature ranges of 150 380 C. 380 500 C. 500 740 C. and 740 1000 C. corresponding to the polymorph evolution of hydrated titanate HTiO.HO trititanate HTiO TiO B and anatase to rutile respectively. The XRD patterns show that anatase is the original phase in the titania silica composite material of Example 1 hydrated titanate ICDD 00 047 0124 and trititanate ICDD 00 047 0561 are formed subsequently after refluxing and during ion exchange treatment and calcination at 400 C. as indicated from the appearance of the 002 peak. The small amount of anatase in the final material could originate from the un reacted initial anatase precursor or the partial transformation of TiO B to anatase that occurs during heat treatment which is similar to that noted in previous reports. In order to quantify the amount of anatase in the TiO B material Rietveld refinement was conducted under a two phase analysis mode. The result indicates a material composition having 87 of TiO B and 13 of anatase i.e. the majority phase in the materials is TiO B. In addition the broadened peaks in the pattern indicated the presence of nanocrystalline grains in the material. Based on Scherrer equation the average grain size of TiO B is estimated to be 6 nm using the FWHM of the 002 peak.

Nitrogen isothermal adsorption desorption measurements were performed to determine the Brunauer Emmett Teller BET surface area and the porosity of the prepared materials. shows the isotherm curve of the prepared TiO B spheres which is a typical Type IV isotherm representing a mesoporous structure with a BET specific surface area of 126 m g. The pore size distribution comprised a unimodal peak around 12 nm which is the same as the colloid size of the silica template. Compared with mesoporous TiO B material intermediate phases show higher surface area but smaller pores. The BET surface areas of hydrated titanate and trititanate are 324 m g and 243 m g respectively.

After removal of water the structure transforms to TiO B and the pore size resumes the original template size. This phenomenon indirectly validates that this mesoporous structure could have excellent capability to accommodate strain and structure changes during battery cycling. The morphology and microstructure of the as prepared materials were analyzed by electron microscopy characterization methods.

A scanning electron microscopy SEM image showed that the precursor titania silica composite particles possessed spherical morphology and uniform particle size distribution. The result of laser diffraction analysis confirmed that the particle size of this material was distributed with a unimodal peak centered at 1 m. Following silica etching and polymorphic phase transformation to the TiO B structure the material retained its overall spherical morphology when compared to the starting precursor material however the structure became mesoporous having 10 15 nm pores substantially uniformly dispersed on the particle surface as shown in . A TEM image indicated that the mesopores were substantially uniformly distributed across the bulk particles rather than only on the surface as shown in . A high resolution TEM HRTEM image also revealed that the structure of the mesoporous microspheres were comprised of many nanocrystallites with grain sizes ranging between 5 10 nm. Additionally a corresponding fast Fourier transform FFT revealed the presented lattice planes of 001 200 110 002 and 310 that exactly correspond to the monoclinic C2 m crystal structure of TiO B. These results validate that the as prepared material is a combination of TiO B polymorph mesoporous structure and spherical morphology.

The electrochemical performance of this material was evaluated in lithium half cells. shows the cyclic voltammetry CV curves of TiO B electrode at different scan rates of 0.10 0.25 0.50 0.75 and 1.00 mV s. There are three pairs of peaks in each CV. The observation of a pair of peaks located between 1.6 V and 2.2 V denoted as A peak is the typical behavior expected for solid state diffusion of lithium intercalation in anatase. The two pairs of peaks located around 1.5 V and 1.6 V denoted as S peak are the characteristic pseudocapacitive behavior of lithium storage in TiO B. Because the peak currents of the S peaks scale with the first power of scan rate and those of the A peaks scale with square root of the scan rate the peak current increment of peak S is much higher than that of peak A with the increase of scan rate. This implied that the fast pseudocapacitive lithium transport dominates the lithium storage process at high currents. This phenomenon directly appears in the charge discharge curves with different rates.

In the low rate C 10 1 C is equal to 335 mA g charge discharge curve two distinct plateaus appear at 1.75 and 1.90 V respectively corresponding to the lithium insertion and de insertion in the anatase phase. But the major capacities occur in the sloped regions of 1.75 1.0 V and 1.0 1.9 V. By analyzing the differential capacity increment curve of the charge branch the pseudocapacitive contribution of TiO B to the total lithium storage is 92 and the contribution of lithium intercalation in anatase is only 8 . This value of anatase content is lower than the result of XRD Rietveld refinement possibly because of incomplete lithiation of anatase at this charge current. With the increase of charge discharge rates the plateaus gradually diminish. For a high rate 10 C charge discharge curve the plateau has almost disappeared. This means at high current rate charge discharge mesoporous TiO B material has the capability to maintain capacity by the fast pseudocapacitive process of lithium storage.

The higher capacity of mesoporous spheres in comparison to nanoparticles at low current rate implies that the former has an advantage of building up a better ionic and electronic conduction net in the electrode layer. At high current rates the difference of reversible capacity between the two materials is even more remarkable. Mesoporous TiO B microspheres show superior rate performance with 165 mAh g at 10 C 130 mAh g at 30 C and 115 mAh g at 60 C while TiOnanopowders only maintain 70 mAh g at 10 C 36 mAh g at 30 C and 23 mAh g at 60 C. Apparently at high rate charge discharge the capacity of nanopowder material only comes from double layer capacitance. However mesoporous TiO B microspherical material can maintain large capacity even at high rates because of its characteristic pseudocapacitive behavior.

In order to test the cyclability at high rates a lithium cell made using mesoporous TiO B spheres were run at 10 C 3350 mA g for 5000 cycles after aging at C 10 for 5 cycles. shows the capacity starts at 166 mAh g and still maintains at 149 mAh g after 5000 cycles with a capacity loss of only 10 . XRD results show that the material structure remains in the TiO B phase even after 5000 cycles. The superior cycling performance can be attributed to the structure stability of TiO B polymorph and the good accommodation to volume strain changes of mesoporous structure during lithium insertion extraction.

A titania precursor without silica was also prepared by a template assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method. Titanium IV bis ammonium lactato dihydroxide solution 200 mL 0.25 M Aldrich is added to a vessel under stirring. The solution is nebulized into small droplets by an ultrasonic atomizer 2.4 MHz Sonaer Ultrasonics . Flowing nitrogen gas carries the droplets through a tube furnace at 500 C. at 1 atm at a flow rate of 3 4 L min. The titania powders were collected for analysis.

Similar to Example 1 the resulting powders were analyzed by SEM. shows the result of the silica free template formation using the aerosol process.
