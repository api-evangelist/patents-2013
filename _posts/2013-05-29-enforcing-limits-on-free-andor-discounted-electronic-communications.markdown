title: Enforcing limits on free and/or discounted electronic communications
abstract: Limits are placed on the number of free and/or discounted communications (such as voice calls and text messages) available to a user, based on the number of communications received by the user. A user is given an allotment of credits, each worth one or more free and/or discounted communications. A credit balance is established and is continually adjusted as follows: it is increased whenever qualifying communications of a given type are received, and is decreased whenever free and/or discounted communications of the given type are initiated by the user. Once the credit balance has been depleted, the user may be blocked from initiating additional free or discounted communications, until the credit balance is increased. In at least one embodiment, different types of credits can be earned and/or used for different types of communications. In at least one embodiment, exchanges between the different types of credits may be permitted.

The present application claims priority as a continuation of U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 13 461 546 for Enforcing Limits on Free and or Discounted Electronic Communications filed May 1 2012 which claimed priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 486 321 for Enforcing Limits on Free Electronic Communications filed May 15 2011. The disclosures of both cases are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to electronic communications and more particularly to a system and method for enforcing limits on free and or discounted electronic communications.

For many forms of electronic communication particularly those involving wireless communication devices both the sender and the recipient of a communication are billed. For other forms only the sender may be billed. Such payment arrangements vary from country to country carrier to carrier as well as from plan to plan for a particular carrier. For example in the United States it is common for both a caller and a recipient of a wireless telephone call to be billed for the call either by paying per minute or by using some portion of an allotment of minutes available to the subscriber . Similarly in the United States text messages are typically billed to both the sender and recipient.

By contrast in many other countries only the sender or caller pays for such communication and the recipient is not billed for receiving the communication. The costs associated with receiving the communication are borne by the recipient s carrier. Carriers may negotiate with one another so that receiving costs are charged back to sending carriers. If one carrier tends to send more communications and another tends to receive more the former may compensate the latter for the difference. In most cases the number of communications received by a carrier will approximately equal the number of communications sent or initiated by that carrier so that the compensation amounts are relatively small or none. In general the arrangements between carriers rely on some approximation of symmetry between incoming and outgoing communications.

Traditionally users can purchase text plans that allow for a certain number of text messages and or voice minutes per month or per year or that allow for unlimited texting and or voice calls. However plans that offer large numbers of messages and or minutes are often quite expensive and many users would benefit from an alternative arrangement wherein text messages and or voice calls could be made for free or for reduced rates.

Some software applications apps allow users to make calls and or send text messages for free. Generally such applications are supported by mobile advertising so that the cost of a message or voice call is offset by paid advertising presented to the sender. An example of such an application is Textfree with Voice available from Pinger Inc. of San Jose Calif.

The ability to initiate communications for free can lead to asymmetry in the number of communications sent and received. A user who has the ability to initiate a communication for free using an ad supported application avoids paying the cost of initiating the communication but the receiving carrier still has to bear the cost of receiving the communication. The receiving carrier may not wish to bear such a cost if it knows that it is likely to receive more communications than it sends.

Such a situation may occur for example if one carrier provides ad supported communications and another does not the carrier that does not provide the ad supported communications may find that it receives more communications than it sends because of the incentives created by carriers that provide ad supported communications. Such asymmetry can cause the negotiated arrangement among carriers to fail since some carriers bear more costs than others. This can lead to some carriers refusing to accept communications from some other carriers because the carriers have no assurance that they will be adequately compensated for the cost of receiving communications.

According to various embodiments of the present invention mechanisms are provided for enforcing a degree of symmetry in sending and receiving of communications including for example voice calls and text messages sent via a mobile communications device so as to place limits on the number of free and or discounted communications available to a user. A user is given an allotment of credits each worth one or more free and or discounted communications for example each credit may be worth one or more text messages or one or more minutes of voice calls. For example a user can be given an initial allotment of 10 credits each worth one text message. Once the credit balance has been established it is continually adjusted based on how many communications of a particular type a user has initiated and how many the user has received. The credit balance is increased whenever qualifying communications are received on the assumption that the carrier will be able to recoup the receiving costs from the sending carrier. The credit balance is decreased whenever free and or discounted communications are initiated by the user. Once the credit balance has been depleted the user may be blocked from initiating additional communications for free and or at discounted rates until the credit balance is increased by receiving communications or by some other means.

In at least one embodiment different types of credits can be earned and or used for different types of communications. Exchanges between the different types of credits may be permitted in at least one embodiment at predefined exchange rates.

In at least one embodiment the system and method of the present invention are implemented on mobile communication devices with support and resources provided by one or more servers which may be located remotely with respect to the communication devices. The system and method of the present invention can be implemented using software running on such mobile communications devices or on servers that handle communications initiated by such devices or on any combination thereof.

In at least one embodiment the system and method of the present invention include a platform for initiating and or receiving electronic communications and for handling billing for such communications. Such a platform may be implemented as an application programming interface API that allows third parties to configure and use the system.

For ease of nomenclature the initiator of an electronic communication is referred to herein as a sender although such a term may apply to a caller initiator or any other individual who initiates an electronic communication. The receiver is referred to as a recipient although this may apply to a callee or any other individual who receives an electronic communication. The techniques of the present invention can be applied to any form of electronic communication whether wireless or wired including but not limited to telephone calls wireless calls text messages instant messages email messages tweets proprietary messages voicemail messages chat messages and the like. Such communications may be synchronous or asynchronous and may be sent and received using any type of communication device including but not limited to telephones wireless telephones smartphones personal computers laptops personal digital assistants tablet computers or the like. Such communications can take place over any form of electronic network whether wired or wireless including but not limited to the Internet wireless telephone networks wired telephone networks pager networks WiFi and the like.

Generally as described in more detail herein the system and method of the present invention provide mechanisms for enforcing a degree of symmetry in sending and receiving of electronic communications such as those sent via a mobile communications device so as to place limits on the number of free and or discounted communications available to a user. According to various embodiments the present invention can be implemented in connection with any suitable device or combination of devices configured to initiate and or receive electronic communications including for example and without limitation smartphones cell phones personal digital assistants landline telephones pay phones VoIP phones computers tablet computers laptop computers desktop computers handheld computers kiosks game systems televisions pagers videophones chat applications instant messaging applications and the like.

The techniques of the present invention can be implemented in connection with any suitable types of electronic communications such as for example and without limitation short message service SMS or text messages multi media message service MMS messages voice calls voicemail messages email messages instant messages chat video chat posts to social networking websites and or blogs and the like. Communications may be implemented via any suitable communications network and according to any known communications protocol. Examples include the Internet cellular telephone networks EDGE 3G 4G long term evolution LTE Session Initiation Protocol SIP Short Message Peer to Peer protocol SMPP SS7 WiFi Bluetooth Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol SHTTP Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP and or the like and or any combination thereof. Communications may be secured if appropriate using any known security techniques such as for example a Virtual Private Network VPN .

For illustrative purposes the invention is described herein in connection with text messages sent from one mobile device to another however one skilled in the art will recognize that the techniques of the present invention is not limited to such devices and communication channels. Rather the techniques of the present invention can be implemented in other contexts such as voice calls made over mobile telecommunications devices or any type of electronic communications made over any suitable device or service. In addition the particular appearance and layout of the various user interface screens for implementing the techniques of the present invention can vary from those presented in the examples herein. Accordingly the following description is intended to illustrate various embodiments of the invention by way of example rather than to limit the scope of the claimed invention.

In at least one embodiment data store stores information describing communications history that may be used in some embodiments for enforcing limits on free and or discounted communications. In at least one embodiment data store includes data representation of a credit balance for keeping track of the number of credits available to device and or to user for outgoing free and or discounted communications according to the techniques described herein. In at least one embodiment communications history and or credit balance is stored in a database or in some other suitable storage mechanism in data store . Alternatively or in addition to being stored in data store such data can be stored in a central location such as on a server. Data store may also contain any other information relevant to the operation of device according to known techniques.

Credit balance represents a current quantity of credits available to user for initiating outgoing communications. In at least one embodiment credits are non monetary in nature and have no value outside of the system for enforcing limits on free and or discounted calls. In other embodiments credits are representative of a monetary value. In yet other embodiments credits are non monetary but can be converted to and or from monetary instruments.

In at least one embodiment different types of credits can be available for different communication types for example one type of credits may be available for text messaging or SMS and a different type of credits may be available for voice communications. Each credit type can have its own balance and each balance can be handled separately for purposes of the techniques of the present invention. In at least one embodiment credits can be exchanged for other types of credits according to some predetermined rate. For example if a user does not have sufficient text messaging credits he or she can use voice call credits at some predetermined rate of exchange. In addition in at least one embodiment a user can expend credits of any type or combination of types to initiate a communication whether or not some or all of the expended credits correspond to the same type as the initiated communication predetermined exchange rates determine how many of each type of credit need be expended. As another example in at least one embodiment users can freely exchange credits of one type for credits of another type based on some predetermined rate of exchange. In at least one other embodiment credits cannot be exchanged for other types of credits.

One skilled in the art will recognize that the particular arrangement of hardware elements shown in is merely exemplary and that the invention can be implemented using different hardware elements configured in any of a number of different ways. Thus the particular architecture shown in is merely illustrative and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. In alternative embodiments the system of the present invention can be implemented in other ways.

Referring now to there is shown a system architecture for implementing the present invention according to at least one embodiment of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the depicted architecture is merely exemplary and that the system of the present invention can be implemented using other architectures.

As depicted in the system of the present invention operates in connection with communications among users such as user A and user B via communication devices A B. Generally as described in more detail herein the system and method of the present invention provide a mechanism for enforcing limits on free and or discounted electronic communications initiated by a user A and or B.

As described above communication devices A B may be of any suitable type. Devices A E communicate with one another via communications network which may include for example the Internet cellular telephone networks EDGE 3G 4G long term evolution LTE Session Initiation Protocol SIP Short Message Peer to Peer protocol SMPP SS7 WiFi Bluetooth Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol SHTTP Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP and or the like and or any combination thereof. As described in more detail below central server is also communicatively connected with devices A B via network or via another communications network. Network may be wireless or wired or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes central server is depicted and described herein as a single machine however it may instead be implemented as a cluster of machines located in a single location or in multiple locations

In at least one embodiment an application programming interface API runs at central server and performs various steps involved in the operation of the present invention. In at least one embodiment API is implemented as software for controlling the operation of one or more processors running at central server . For example API may cause central server to interact with software running at devices A B so as to enforce limits on free and or discounted electronic communications according to the techniques described herein. In connection with such operations central server may retrieve access and or adjust credit balances for users and or for devices according to the techniques described herein. Such credit balances can be stored at data store associated with central server and or at any other suitable location. As described above credit balances can be stored at individual devices in addition to or instead of being stored at data store .

Additional devices can also be connected to network and may operate in conjunction with the present invention. For example the techniques of the present invention can be implemented in connection with any number of users and or devices .

According to various embodiments of the present invention mechanisms are provided for enforcing a degree of symmetry in sending and receiving of communications including for example voice calls and text messages sent via a mobile communications device so as to place limits on the number of free and or discounted communications available to a particular user and or on a particular device . A credit balance is maintained to keep track of how many free and or discounted outgoing communications are available at any given time once credit balance is depleted user and or device are blocked from initiating free and or discounted outgoing communications until additional credits are acquired. In various embodiments credits are acquired by receiving qualifying incoming communications paid for by another party. In various embodiments credits can also be purchased. The limits placed on free and or discounted communications can be imposed on a per user and or per device basis.

Referring now to there is shown a flowchart depicting a method for enforcing limits on free and or discounted electronic communications according to at least one embodiment of the present invention. The method depicted in can be practiced for example by software running at device associated with user for example such software may provide functionality for enabling sending and receiving of free discounted and or paid text messages and or other types of communications. Alternatively the method can be practiced at software running at a carrier server or other device or service for enabling electronic communications among users . Alternatively the method can be practiced at a combination of device based and centrally based software. One skilled in the art will recognize that the particular sequence of steps shown in is merely illustrative and that the present invention can be practiced using other sequences of steps.

A user or device is given an allotment of credits each worth some quantity of free and or discounted communications for example each credit may be worth one or more text messages or one or more minutes of voice calls. For example a device can be given an initial allotment of ten credits each worth one text message. A counter reflects a credit balance stored at device and or at a central data store and indicates how many credits remain for use by user and or device .

As discussed above in at least one embodiment credits are non monetary in nature. In embodiments where credits represent monetary value credit balance can be reflective of an actual monetary account.

This credit balance is continually adjusted based on how many communications of a particular type have been initiated at device and how have been received at device . Credit balance may or may not be visible on display screen . In at least one embodiment credit balance may be presented as a numeric value and or graphic indicator. In at least one embodiment a distinctive visual auditory or haptic indicator may be provided to warn user when credit balance falls below some threshold amount or is at zero. In at least one embodiment an additional indicator is shown when credit balance is increased or decreased so as to inform user of the change in credit balance .

In at least one embodiment if device is used by more than one user credit balance can be shared among such users or each such user may have his or her own account with a separate credit balance . Users may sign on to make communications using unique login identifiers and or passwords so that they consume and receive credits on an individual basis. In such an embodiment therefore two different users on a particular device may have different credit balances so that the number of available credits may depend on which user is signed into his or her account on device at any given point in time. In another embodiment credits are associated with device rather than with individual users so that a certain number of credits may be available at a given point in time on device regardless of which user is using device .

In at least one embodiment whenever a qualifying incoming communication is received by user at device credit balance for that device or user is increased accordingly on the assumption that the carrier will be able to recoup the receiving costs from the sending carrier. In at least one embodiment credit balance is increased whether or not user actually reads or listens to acknowledges or participates in the communication in another embodiment credit balance is only increased when user actually reads or listens to acknowledges or participates in the communication. In at least one embodiment as described below certain incoming communications may qualify and others may not for example those incoming communications that are paid for by the sender qualify for accrual of credits while those that are not paid for do not accrue credits. In addition in at least one embodiment different qualifying incoming communications may earn different numbers of credits depending on various factors as described below.

Free and or discounted communications initiated at device cause credit balance to be decreased. Whenever user attempts to initiate a free and or discounted communication for example by sending a free text message a determination is made as to whether sufficient credits remain on device or on user s account if so the requested free and or discounted communication is initiated or sent and the credit balance is decreased accordingly.

Once the credit balance has been depleted or falls below a defined threshold amount the ability to initiate free and or discounted communications at device may be temporarily blocked until the credit balance is increased by receiving communications or by some other means. In an embodiment where credits are associated with individual users rather than devices an individual user s ability to initiate free and or discounted communications can be temporarily blocked while another user who still has credits may still be able to initiate free and or discounted communications using the same device once that user has appropriately logged in to access his or her credits .

In at least one embodiment if no or insufficient credits remain the request to send a message is declined . In at least one embodiment when a request is declined user may be given an opportunity to purchase credits and or may be given an opportunity to send the message by paid channels. Referring now to there is shown an example of a screen for purchasing credits. Buttons provide options for purchasing different amounts of credits.

In another embodiment if no or insufficient credits remain the message is sent by normal paid channels.

In at least one embodiment user can purchase credits by entering a credit card number or by authenticating him or herself to access a previously entered payment mechanism. In response to such an action the credit balance is increased accordingly.

In various embodiments the technique of the present invention can be applied to any suitable type of communication. For example for voice communications or other communications where the duration or length of the communication is relevant each credit can correspond to a particular number of minutes rather than to a discrete communication. Thus the credit balance corresponds to a total number of available minutes of free and or discounted calls. Credits are deducted in response to outgoing minutes of free and or discounted calls and the credit balance is increased in response to incoming minutes of qualifying calls. In at least one embodiment if credit balance reaches zero in the midst of an outgoing communication for example a voice call the communication can be terminated automatically. In at least one embodiment user can be given a warning and or grace period before such termination takes place and or can be given an opportunity to replenish credit balance to avert termination of the call.

In at least one embodiment credit balance may drop below zero for example if user uses the grace period or otherwise fails to terminate a telephone call or other communication that continues to use credits after the credit balance has reached zero. In at least one other embodiment credit balance may not drop below zero because the system blocks and or terminates any further free outgoing communications when credit balance has reached zero. In at least one embodiment credit balance does not drop below zero even when the grace period is used.

In at least one embodiment each qualifying incoming communication earns a fixed number of credits such as one credit regardless of the size or nature of the communication. In another embodiment each qualifying incoming communication earns a number of credits that can vary depending on any suitable factor or factors for example the number of credits earned by receiving a qualifying incoming communication can depend on the size of the communication expressed for example as a number of kilobytes or megabytes the type of communication the sender the amount paid by the sender the source the carrier the duration or length of the communication the bandwidth consumed by the communication and or any other suitable factor or factors. For example a text message may be worth one credit while a message containing a photo attachment may be worth three credits and a voice call may be worth 2 credits per minute.

In at least one embodiment the number of credits deducted for each free and or discounted outgoing communication initiated by user and or at device is fixed for example each such communication can cost one credit regardless of the size or nature of the communication. In another embodiment a conversion rate can be established to determine a cost in credits for each free and or discounted outgoing communication this conversion rate can be fixed or can vary depending on any suitable factor or factors for example the cost can depend on the size of the communication expressed for example as a number of kilobytes or megabytes the type of communication the amount of the discount if applicable the sender the type of device the intended recipient the carrier the duration or length of the communication the bandwidth consumed by the communication and or any other suitable factor or factors. For example a text message may cost one credit while a message containing a photo attachment may cost three credits and a voice call may cost 2 credits per minute.

The cost of outgoing communications may or may not be related to the amount earned for similar incoming communications.

For purposes of this description the term cost is intended to mean the amount by which credit balance is decreased when an outgoing communication takes place.

In at least one embodiment a user interface can be provided to allow user to trade one type of credit for another for example exchanging voice minutes for text messages or vice versa at some appropriate exchange rate. In at least one embodiment credit balance can be expressed in terms of some currency or point system with each type of communication having a corresponding cost in credits.

In at least one embodiment incoming communications qualify for accrual of credits only if it can be determined that the incoming communication is being paid for by the initiator of the communication. In at least one embodiment for example calls from landlines might be excluded so that only calls from mobile telephones increase the allotment. In at least one embodiment only communications from certain carriers jurisdictions and or regions may increase credit balance while other communications do not. Various known techniques can be used for identifying the origin of an incoming communication so as to determine whether or not the credit balance should be increased. In at least one embodiment different types of incoming communications can accrue credits at different conversion rates. The conversion rate for accrual of credits based on incoming communications may be equal to the rate for converting credits to outgoing communications or the two rates may be different from one another.

In at least one embodiment an incoming communication qualifies for accrual of credits only if the recipient reads listens to participates in responds to and or otherwise takes action with respect to the communication.

In at least one embodiment certain communications can be initiated without affecting user s credit balance . For example in at least one embodiment user can initiate paid communications without affecting credit balance . In addition certain communications to other subscribers of a particular service may be permitted for free without affecting credit balance . For example a free text message may be permitted to a recipient without affecting the sender s credit balance if it is known that the recipient subscribes to an ad supported text message service so that the cost of receiving the text message will be borne by the ad supported service.

In at least one embodiment restrictions may be placed on the types of communications that can be initiated for free or can be discounted using credits. For example such free and or discounted communications can be limited to calls and or messages within the country or state or to recipients that are on a particular carrier. Similarly in at least one embodiment restrictions can be placed on the type of incoming communications that increase the credit balance for example calls from outside the country or state or from certain carriers might be ineligible to increase credit balance .

In at least one embodiment user can receive additional credits in various ways. For example user can be granted a fixed additional allotment of credits periodically such as on a monthly basis .

In at least one embodiment credit balance can be increased in other ways in response to certain trigger events or actions. For example the user can participate in certain activities and or perform certain actions to increase credit balance . Examples of actions that may earn credits include agreeing to accept promotional messages viewing ads referring other customers participating in surveys making qualifying purchases from certain merchants and the like.

In at least one embodiment mechanisms can be implemented that allow transfers of credits from one user to another or gifts consisting of some number of credits. In at least one embodiment user can use credits to purchase other tangible or nontangible goods or services and or exchange them for money airline miles or other currency like resources.

In at least one embodiment a maximum credit balance can be imposed so that user cannot save up additional credits beyond the specified maximum balance. In at least one embodiment credits expire after some period of time.

In at least one embodiment the above described techniques can be used to enforce limits on discounted communications. For example credits can be accrued substantially as described above such credits can then be used for obtaining discounts on outgoing communications. Any suitable rate can be established for converting credits to discounts.

In at least one embodiment subject to local laws and regulations monetary instruments or accounts can be used in lieu of a non monetary credit balance . Thus qualifying incoming communications can earn monetary credit to be deposited in a monetary account associated with user such as a bank account debit card account credit card account or the like. Outgoing communications can cause such an account to be debited according to the cost of the communication.

In at least one embodiment display screen of device can indicate the current credit balance for a device and or user and if appropriate can show how the credits translate into minutes and or text messages so as to inform user as to how many free and or discounted minutes and or messages are currently available to user . This display can take any form as appropriate including graphical text and or numeric components to inform the user as to his or her current credit balance. The display can be dynamic so that it changes with each incoming or outgoing free and or discounted communication. If appropriate the display can change during a communication for example as each minute passes on a voice call.

In other embodiments user can be informed of his or her credit balance in other ways including for example and without limitation consulting a web page receiving a text message or email message voice call either automated or not printed statement audio signal indicator light dedicated display haptic signal such as a vibration or the like. In yet another embodiment user may not be given access to such information.

In at least one embodiment a distinctive alert or indicator may be provided to warn user when credit balance falls below some threshold amount which can be fixed or user configurable or when credit balance reaches zero. Any suitable alert or indicator can be used including for example visual auditory and or haptic alerts.

For example a pop up alert can be shown when user has two or fewer credits left. The alert can include a reminder to user to encourage his or her friends to send him or her more text messages so as to increase the credit balance for example You have only 2 outbound texts left Receive more texts tell your friends to text you or buy more credits. A further alert can be shown when user has no remaining credits for example Oops looks like you re out of outbound texts. Receive more texts tell your friends to text you or buy more credits. Either or both of these alerts can be accompanied by buttons or links for sending a reminder to friends to send more text messages to user and or to a purchase screen for buying more credits. In another embodiment the system of the present invention provides mechanisms for sending such reminders to friends without using credits for example by sending messages using other communications channels. Such communications channels can include for example and without limitation email Facebook and the like.

In another embodiment credit balance information including warnings and alerts can be presented and or sent to user by any suitable means including and without limitation a web page email text message Facebook and the like.

As described above when user has insufficient or no remaining credits user may be prevented from initiating any free and or discounted communications until the credit balance is increased.

As another example the allotment display can flash or be presented in a different color or font or can otherwise be highlighted when credit balance drops below the threshold level.

Referring now to there is shown a screen shot depicting an example of a user interface for viewing and interacting with text messages according to at least one embodiment of the present invention. In this example the system of the present invention is implemented on a device having a touch sensitive screen such as an iPhone from Apple Inc. of Cupertino Calif. Accordingly screen shot is an example of a user interface as it might appear on display screen of device used by user . One skilled in the art will recognize that the display shown in is merely exemplary and that the techniques of the present invention can be implemented using other arrangements and layouts.

At the top of screen shot is a credit balance indicator showing current credit balance associated with device and or user in the example the balance shows 10 indicating that this particular device and or user currently has an allotment of 10 free and or discounted outgoing text messages. Recent change indicator informs user of any recent changes in credit balance in this example indicator shows 1 indicating that user has just earned one credit for an incoming text message. In at least one embodiment when a credit is earned such an indicator is displayed in a transitory fashion such as momentarily or until dismissed. Also indicator is updated to reflect the credit balance increase. In at least one embodiment when a credit is used for example when user sends a free and or discounted text message indicator such as a 1 indicator is displayed in a transitory fashion such as momentarily or until dismissed. Also indicator is updated to reflect the credit balance increase. In another embodiment recent change indicator can be omitted or can be shown only when a credit is earned or only when a credit is used. In another embodiment user can specify via a preferences screen whether and when indicator should be shown.

In at least one embodiment certain types of communications may be free and or discounted and may not cause any credits to be used. In at least one embodiment when a user initiates such a communication an indicator not shown can be displayed in a transitory fashion to inform user that this communication is free and or discounted and did not use any credits. Such an indicator can take any suitable form. For example credit balance indicator may flash or be momentarily highlighted to emphasize the fact that its value did not change. Alternatively recent change indicator can show 0 or some other message informing user that no change has been made to credit balance .

In at least one embodiment a user can invoke a screen for viewing more details concerning the current credit balance . For example such a screen can be invoked when the user taps on the credit balance indicator or on a button or other user interface element.

Referring now to there is shown a screen shot depicting an example of a user interface for viewing and interacting with text messages according to another embodiment of the present invention wherein at least two different types of credits can be accumulated and used. Again screen shot is an example of a user interface as it might appear on display screen of device used by user . One skilled in the art will recognize that the display shown in is merely exemplary and that the techniques of the present invention can be implemented using other arrangements and layouts.

In the example of voice credits and text message or SMS credits can be accumulated. Indicators A and B reflect the current balance of voice credits and text message credits respectively and are updated as incoming and or outgoing communications take place. In at least one embodiment a capacity indicator which may be shown as an icon and or numerically indicates the current credit balance of a particular type as a percentage of a predetermined maximum allowable credit balance and or indicates the maximum number of credits of a given type that can be stored.

An example of a text credit balance screen is depicted in . Screen includes an indicator of current credit balance along with a reminder to inform user that he or she can earn additional credits for received text messages. In at least one embodiment screen also includes button that allows the user to send a message to remind his or her friends to text him or her so that he or she can earn additional credits in at least one embodiment the sending of such a reminder message is free and does not use credits.

In at least one embodiment screen also includes button to allow user to buy additional credits. In at least one embodiment credits can be purchased in fixed allotments for different prices for example 10 credits for X 20 credits for Y and 30 credits for Z as appropriate. Charges can be made via credit card or any other suitable payment system. In at least one embodiment activating button takes the user to screen for purchasing credits.

Although depicts an example wherein credit balance screen refers to text credits a corresponding screen can be provided for other types of credits including credits for voice calls and or other types of communication. For example in an embodiment where credits represent minutes of voice calls indicator may refer to minutes rather than credits or texts . Similar adaptations and or modifications can be made to any of other examples depicted and described herein in connection with credit balances for communications other than text messages. Thus the particular screen displays depicted herein are intended to be exemplary and can be adapted as needed for other types of communications.

Referring now to there is shown an example of a text message composition screen according to at least one embodiment including conversation display showing recent inbound and outbound text messages text entry box for composing new text messages and send button for causing an entered text message to be sent. Indicator of credit balance is shown adjacent to text entry box . In this example indicator includes both a numeric indication of the number of text messages remaining in credit balance and a graphical indication of the credit balance as a percentage of the overall maximum credit balance. One skilled in the art will recognize that indicator can take other forms including for example a numeric indication of the number of text messages remaining in credit balance . Other buttons such as call button contact info button inbox button and clear button are shown for illustrative purposes only.

Referring now to there is shown an example of a text conversation screen for a series of text messages to and from another user of the same application. In at least one embodiment when both the sender and recipient of a text message are both users of and subscribers of a free texting service text messages between the parties are free and are not deducted from the credit balance. Accordingly in the example of a free indicator is shown in lieu of the credit balance indicator or to inform user that text messages to and from this person are free and are not deducted from the credit balance.

Tables 1 and 2 illustrate examples of the operation of the present invention according to at least one embodiment.

Several events in Table 1 illustrate features of various embodiments of the present invention as described above.

For example event 6 illustrates an example of an outgoing message that does not need or use a credit since the message is being sent from one user of an app to another user of the same app.

In event 9 user attempts to send a text message. Since credit balance is zero the attempt is declined. As described above in connection with user may be given an opportunity to purchase credits and or may be given an opportunity to send the message by paid channels.

As described above some incoming messages may not qualify for accrual of credits. In this example event 12 is such an event therefore no credits are added.

As described above certain communications can be initiated without affecting user s credit balance . In this example event 13 is a text message sent to a subscriber of an ad supported text message and event 14 is a text message that is paid for by user therefore no credits are used for sending these two messages.

The examples of Table 2 illustrate an embodiment in which credits can be earned and or used for both text messages and voice calls with each text message being worth one credit and each minute of a voice call being worth one credit. As described above in various embodiments each communication can be worth any number of credits and the number of credits earned for an incoming communication having given duration length or size need not equal the number of credits used to send a communication having the same or similar characteristics. For example and without limitations each incoming minute of voice calls can accrue more or fewer credits than are needed to send a minute of a voice call. Similarly each incoming text message can accrue more or fewer credits than are needed to send a text message. Alternatively as described herein separate balances can be maintained for text credits and voice credits a rate of exchange can be established to allow a user to exchange one for the other.

Referring now to there is shown an example of a screen for displaying conversion rates according to at least one embodiment of the present invention. In this example credits are referred to as points . Point earning rates are shown 10 points per received SMS message and 40 points per minute of received inbound voice calls . Point consumption rates are also shown 10 points per outbound SMS message 40 points per minute of outbound voice calls and 100 points per minute of outbound voice calls . Link to international rates may be provided such international rates may be the same or different than domestic rates. As in indicators A and B reflect the current balance of voice credits and text message credit and capacity indicator is also included.

These rates are merely exemplary. One skilled in the art will recognize that the particular ratio and conversion rates among credits and various types of communications are merely illustrative and that the invention can be practiced with any suitable ratio and or conversion rate.

Furthermore one skilled in the art will recognize that the particular events and effects depicted in the tables are provided merely for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention to particular types of communications methods of accruing or using credits or the like.
