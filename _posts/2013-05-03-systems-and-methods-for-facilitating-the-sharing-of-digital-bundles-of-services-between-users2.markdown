This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 719 900 filed Oct. 29 2012 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 298 118 filed Mar. 15 2013 which are both expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present disclosure relates generally to digital services and computerized systems and methods for aggregating and sharing digital services in bundles. More particularly and without limitation the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for presenting storing bundling sharing and managing purchases of digital services and or other items e.g. coupons subscriptions redeemable credits and exclusive discounts etc. .

Various solutions exist for presenting advertisements sales information and products and services to customers. However customers are frequently presented with broad presentations and usually do not have the freedom to receive or create offers that are tailored to them. Another drawback of existing solutions is that they require customers or online users to manage and purchase services and or other items individually or according to predetermined packages. Moreover users are required to purchase services from each individual service provider i.e. Netflix Pandora One Norton etc. using individual user accounts for each service and according to predetermined pricing structures.

There are also other drawbacks. For example existing service providers including those that provide online services and other digital services do not allow end users to customize packages of services or to buy items in bundles. Furthermore existing service providers do not provide users the ability to customize and share services for creating a unique and tailored experience for users and their friends.

In addition some premier marketers use behavior and search patterns to present targeted advertising and sales information to users. However as Do Not Track DNT and other privacy measures become more prominent the ability of entities to purchase the information used to identify these patterns will significantly diminish.

In view of the foregoing there is a need for improved systems and methods for providing digital services to customers. There also exists a need for improved systems and methods for presenting storing bundling sharing and managing purchases of digital services and or other items. A need also exists for solutions that enable customers and other users the ease convenience and access of purchasing and or sharing multiple services from different service providers with the simplified billing and the cost savings of bundled purchasing.

Consistent with the present disclosure systems and methods are provided for aggregating and sharing digital services in bundles. Embodiments of the present disclosure encompass improved systems and methods for providing digital services to customers including online and mobile users of digital services. In addition embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods for presenting storing bundling sharing and managing purchases of digital services and or other items e.g. coupons subscriptions redeemable credits and exclusive discounts etc. .

In accordance with additional embodiments of the present disclosure a system is provided for allowing a primary user to share a digital service in a bundle of services with a secondary user. The system may comprise at least one processor and a memory device storing instructions which when executed by the at least one processor causes the processor to receive a request from the primary user to share a first service in the bundle of services with the secondary user the bundle of services being implemented by a plurality of different service providers. A first token may be generated that associates the secondary user with the first service to be shared. The first token may be sent to one of the plurality of different service providers to enable access to the first service by the secondary user.

In accordance with certain embodiments a computerized method is provided for allowing a primary user to share a digital service in a bundle of services with a secondary user.

The software that provides the functionality described by an API is said to be an implementation of the API. Bundler system may allow service provider to write to an API to have its service made available for bundling. illustrates an exemplary diagram for the exchange of API requests and responses between bundler system and service providers according to embodiments of the present disclosure.

Bundler system may also be configured to accept requests from users for a digital bundle of services and provide the bundle to the user via for example an online dashboard. The online dashboard may include any portal or webpage for displaying a graphical user interface to user on primary user device or secondary user device . For example bundler system may receive a request from primary user device for purchasing and accessing a particular bundle of digital services. Such services may include digital subscriptions redeemable credits and or exclusive discounts referred to herein as digital services or simply services . These services may include but are not limited to data news music photos video search security shopping social networking travel and other such services such as Netflix Pandora One Norton Consumer Reports Redbox LivingSocial iTunes ADT and Overstock.com . As further described herein digital subscriptions refer to services that provide monthly access to digital content e.g. music videos etc. in the form of a subscription such as Netflix or Pandora One . Redeemable credits or coupons refer to a credit for an amount of money that may be redeemed for products and or services either online or in store e.g. 10 to use on LivingSocial 20 to use in stores at Best Buy etc. . Redeemable credits may be consumed on a transaction by transaction basis without a subscription. In certain embodiments redeemable credits may be issued in configurable numbers per day month or year. Exclusive discounts refer to a credit for a certain discount that may be redeemed for products and or services either online or in store e.g. 10 off at Overstock.com 5 off in stores at Best Buy etc. . Other information products or services may be offered and provided in a bundle such as bonus products or services.

Bundler system may send a request to service provider indicating a user s request to activate or access when pre activated the particular service s provided by service provider e.g. iTunes provided by Apple Inc. . Service provider may acknowledge the request and send a response back to bundler system using for example predetermined handshake protocols. As a result of receiving the response bundler system may render a landing page e.g. webpage for primary user device to access the service. In other embodiments handshake protocol s need not be executed for bundler system to render the landing page. In such embodiments bundler system may send a request to service provider and render the landing page without waiting for service provider to send an acknowledgment or response.

In step bundler system may receive from a user via primary user device selection s for a bundle either prepackaged or customized . For example bundler system may allow a user to choose a prepackaged bundle including 4 digital subscriptions 1 redeemable credit and 2 exclusive discounts. In another example a user may create a custom bundle by choosing for instance 2 digital subscriptions not offered in the prepackaged bundle 2 redeemable credits and 2 different exclusive discounts not offered in the prepackaged bundle. In one embodiment the graphical user interface provided by bundler system offers a configurable number of services or products from one or more categories. For example a user may select 1 service or product from the service subscriptions 1 service or product from the redeemable coupons and 1 service or product from the exclusive discounts. illustrates an exemplary interface for receiving selections s from a user for a prepackaged bundle of services. illustrates an exemplary interface for receiving selections s from a user for a customized bundle of services.

Returning to in step bundler system may receive and store user account information. For example bundler system may request that the user enter a username password payment information email address mailing address phone number etc. Bundler system may store this information to create a user account. The user account may allow the user to login and access the services facilitated by bundler system . Bundler system may charge the user a price for the bundle of services e.g. 15 month for the bundle .

In step bundler system may display the user s bundled services on primary user device of the user. For example bundler system may generate a graphical user interface such as a dashboard for displaying the user s bundled services. displays an exemplary screenshot of a dashboard displaying the user s selected services as further described herein. The dashboard may be displayed in a web browser as depicted in or on a mobile application not shown .

Method may also include receiving a request from a user via primary user device to access one of user s bundled services e.g. pre selected or pre purchased step . For example bundler system may provide a hyperlink to allow user to Sign In to access his her subscription to for example Netflix .

In one embodiment bundler system may provide a password manager plug in not shown to allow the user to enter one username and password for his her multiple services. Conventional password manager plug ins and or similar technology may be used for this purpose.

Referring again to in step bundler system may create a unique token used to provide a user access to one or more services. For example bundler system may generate a token to uniquely identify a subscription within a package or bundle of services. Thus when a user purchases a bundle with for example 10 services bundler system may generate 10 unique tokens to identify each of these 10 subscriptions. In another embodiment a token may identify a set of services. Each token may also include or identify other information e.g. user credentials status and or duration of a subscription usage and or billing details etc. . In one embodiment bundler system may create the unique token for each subscription before the user requests to activate the service e.g. after the user selects a pre packaged or customized bundle of services .

As further shown in in step bundler system may build a URL that includes or embeds a unique token within the URL string. Bundler system may send the URL string with the embedded token to service provider . The token in the URL string may be used between bundler system and service provider e.g. Equifax LivingSocial Netflix etc. for providing the user access to the specific service for which the token was created. Thus in certain embodiments the token may act as a communication tool between bundler system and service provider for identifying and tracking the user and his her use or access of the particular service s provided by service provider . The token may consist of a randomly generated string of numbers and or characters. In one implementation the token may comprise a multi part token where each part represents coded information such as identification of the user service provider digital service length of service restrictions on service expiration of service status of service e.g. activated not activated shared reclaimed etc. associated users with service e.g. lendors lendees etc. etc.

In step bundler system may receive an URL response from service provider which may acknowledge the request based on the token. In other embodiments tokens may be passed between bundler system and service provider to pass other information including user credentials status and or duration of a subscription usage of a subscription billing details etc. Bundler system and service provider may communicate with each other via an API using the tokens.

In step bundler system may determine through e.g. handshaking protocols that a valid response has been received from service provider . Once the handshake has been completed bundler system can render the landing page of service provider for display to user on primary user device . For example bundler system can render the webpage of www.netflix.com in user s browser window on primary user device . In one embodiment bundler system need not receive a response from service provider . In this embodiment bundler system may send a request to service provider and render the landing page without waiting for service provider to send an acknowledgment or response.

The token embedded in the URL string may indicate to service provider to provide its digital content to user. The token may serve to manage account information including the identity of the purchaser the service purchased the terms of the purchase the duration of the service etc. The token therefore may serve as a unique identifier of the user and service per bundle. illustrates an exemplary landing page rendered by bundler system using a token embedded in a URL string according to the disclosed embodiments.

Returning to in step bundler system may update the dashboard of the user to reflect the activated service s . For example in the exemplary dashboard reflects that the service for Pandora One has been activated e.g. Sign In is displayed versus Activate .

In one embodiment bundler system may allow the user to deactivate services. Embodiments consistent with the present disclosure may enable instantaneous activation or deactivation of the service within the bundle.

The promotion code may be associated with service provider and may be configured to be provided to service provider during a checkout process. In one embodiment bundler system may generate the promotion code in response to receiving a request from the user. For example bundler system may provide a clickable button or hyperlink that when clicked by the user reveals a promotional code the user can use with service provider to redeem the service e.g. by the user clicking Get Code in . In one embodiment bundler system may reveal the code to the user without requiring the user to request to reveal it e.g. upon the user s request to redeem it in step .

In step bundler system may display the promotion code to the user on primary user device . For example bundler system may display the promotion code in a web browser or in a mobile application of primary user device . In one embodiment bundler system may reveal the promotion code in response to receiving a request from the user e.g. by the user clicking Reveal Code . In one embodiment bundler system may reveal the code to the user without requiring the user to request to reveal it e.g. upon the user s request to redeem it in step . illustrates an exemplary interface rendered by bundler system displaying a promotion code according to the disclosed embodiments.

In step bundler system may redirect the user to service provider s webpage in the user s current web browser of primary user device . In another embodiment bundler system may render a landing page of service provider in the current web browser or mobile application of primary user device . In one embodiment bundler system may receive a request from the user to be redirected to service provider s webpage to redeem the selected service e.g. by the user clicking Launch in . The user may then be able to redeem the code by supplying service provider with the code during for example an online check out process.

In another embodiment bundler system may build a URL with a unique token embedded within the URL string and redirect user to the landing page of service provider in accordance with steps of . In this embodiment the token provided by bundler system may allow the code to be automatically uploaded to the checkout process provided by service provider without the user manually entering the code himself.

In step bundler system may update the dashboard of the user to reflect that the service has been redeemed. For example in the dashboard reflects that the service for LivingSocial Promo Code has not been redeemed and the service for Fandango has been redeemed e.g. it has already been revealed and or used or it can no longer be lent .

In step bundler system may receive information from the primary user about the secondary user to facilitate the lending such as email address or mobile phone number. In one embodiment bundler system may allow the primary user to create a personal message to send to the secondary user. illustrates an exemplary interface generated by bundler system for collecting information from the primary user to facilitate the lending. In step bundler system may generate and send a message to the secondary user on secondary user device . Similar to primary user device secondary user device may include one or more of a tablet device mobile phone smart phone computer laptop personal digital assistant television or any other device that a user may use to purchase and access services.

In another embodiment bundler system may require the secondary user to activate the shared service using one or more of the steps disclosed in exemplary method .

In step bundler system may update the dashboard of the primary user to reflect that the service has been shared or lent to a secondary user e.g. Reclaim versus Sign In Activate See Code or Get Code in . As a result in one embodiment bundler system may not allow the primary user to access use or redeem the service while it is being shared with the secondary user. Additional embodiments are disclosed and described herein for sharing a service and reclaiming a shared service.

In step bundler system may change the status of the primary user and secondary user to lendor and lendee respectively. Bundler system may store these statuses. For example the unique tokens of each of the primary and secondary users for this particular service may reflect that the service is being shared by the lendor primary with the lendee secondary.

In step bundler system may pass the unique tokens of the primary and secondary users to service provider to indicate the current statuses of the primary and secondary users. The unique tokens may provide the knowledge needed by service provider to allow the secondary user to now access use or redeem the service and to prevent the primary user from now accessing using or redeeming the service.

In step bundler system may receive a response from service provider that the token s have been successfully received.

In step bundler system may change the status of the primary user and secondary user. Bundler system may remove the status of the primary user as lendor and reinstate the original status. Bundler system may also remove the status of the secondary as lendee and indicate a new status to reflect the temporary status provided to the secondary user by bundler system . Bundler system may store these statuses. For example the unique tokens of each of the primary and secondary users for this particular service may reflect that the service is no longer being shared by the primary user and is available to the secondary user for a temporary period until the secondary user purchases the service or a predetermined temporary period expires.

In step bundler system may pass the unique tokens of the primary and secondary users to service provider to indicate the current statuses of the primary and secondary users. The unique tokens may provide the knowledge needed by service provider to allow the primary user to now access use or redeem the service and to provide a temporary period for which the secondary user can access use or redeem the service. In one embodiment the primary user s token may represent coded information associating the primary user the service and the status of the primary user as having reclaimed the service.
