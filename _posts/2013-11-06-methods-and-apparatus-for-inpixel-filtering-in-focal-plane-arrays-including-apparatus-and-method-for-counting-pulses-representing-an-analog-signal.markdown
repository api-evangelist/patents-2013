title: Methods and apparatus for in-pixel filtering in focal plane arrays including apparatus and method for counting pulses representing an analog signal
abstract: Digital focal plane arrays (DFPAs) with multiple counters per unit cell can be used to convert analog signals to digital data and to filter the digital data. Exemplary DFPAs include two-dimensional arrays of unit cells, where each unit cell is coupled to a corresponding photodetector in a photodetector array. Each unit cell converts photocurrent from its photodetector to a digital pulse train that is coupled to multiple counters in the unit cell. Each counter in each unit cell can be independently controlled to filter the pulse train by counting up or down and/or by transferring data as desired. For example, a unit cell may perform in-phase/quadrature filtering of homodyne- or heterodyne-detected photocurrent with two counters: a first counter toggled between increment and decrement modes with an in-phase signal and a second counter toggled between increment and decrement modes with a quadrature signal.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8721 05 C 0002 awarded by the U.S. Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Focal plane arrays FPAs are two dimensional arrays of photodetectors disposed in the focal plane of a lens for imaging spectrometry lidar wave front sensing and other applications. Conventional FPAs typically provide analog readouts with the analog signals generated at the pixel level converted to digital signals by external analog to digital converters ADCs . Once converted by the external ADCs the digital signals may be processed according to the demands of a particular application.

Fundamental limitations on the photodetector dynamic range active area and readout noise floor limit the practical scalability of conventional FPAs. For example decreasing the size of capacitors used to store accumulated photocurrents causes the data transfer rate also known as the frame rate to increase beyond acceptable limits. Similarly electronics noise and ringing limit the amount of data that can be transmitted on a single output tap to maintain the desired signal to noise ratio SNR and dynamic range. Attempting to scale conventional analog technology to meet more demanding performance requirements leads to an FPA that is significantly large and complex and consumes excessive power for most applications.

In some examples of focal plane arrays each pixel of the FPA may be referred to as a unit cell that includes circuitry for processing electric signals associated with the pixel. In various implementations each unit cell may include one or more of 1 a photodetector to receive incident radiation and provide an analog electric signal in response to the incident radiation 2 an analog to digital converter an in pixel ADC to convert the analog electric signal to a digital signal and 3 additional circuitry e.g. digital logic to process the digital signal and provide pixel data output such additional circuitry also is referred to herein generally as in pixel digital processing circuitry . Accordingly it should be appreciated that in some implementations respective unit cells of an array may not necessarily include the photodetector itself but instead include only the in pixel ADC and in some cases in pixel digital processing circuitry to process the digital signal output by the in pixel ADC i.e. the analog signal applied to the in pixel ADC is received from an external source . Furthermore in some implementations the digital signal output by the ADC may in some instances be provided directly as pixel data output for the corresponding pixel while in other instances this digital signal may be further processed by the in pixel digital processing circuitry to provide the pixel data output.

In some implementations of such arrays the digital signal provided as an output of an in pixel ADC may include a series of pulses e.g. via an in pixel ADC implemented as a voltage to frequency or current to frequency converter . In such implementations the series of pulses serving as the digital signal may be applied to the in pixel digital circuitry which in turn provides the pixel data output.

In particular all combinations of claimed subject matter appearing at the end of this disclosure are contemplated as being part of the inventive subject matter disclosed herein. It should also be appreciated that terminology explicitly employed herein that also may appear in any disclosure incorporated by reference should be accorded a meaning most consistent with the particular concepts disclosed herein.

Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to and embodiments of inventive methods apparatus and systems for in pixel filtering in focal plane arrays. It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways as the disclosed concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.

Various inventive methods apparatus and systems disclosed herein relate generally to digital processing circuitry disposed in respective pixels of an array in which such digital processing circuitry may be flexibly configured controlled to function in various operating modes within a given pixel and or in similar or different operating modes from pixel to pixel in the array. In various embodiments variably controllable in pixel digital processing circuitry may be particularly configured to process digital signals in the form of a series of pulses and such circuitry may be implemented in any of a variety of manners generally based at least in part on digital logic . Examples of in pixel digital processing circuitry contemplated by various embodiments disclosed herein include but are not limited to one or more of the following elements alone or in combination logic gates flip flops registers e.g. shift registers multiplexers digital counters and the like. In some implementations in pixel digital processing circuitry may be implemented in the form of one or more state machines having multiple selectable operating modes to provide pixel data output based on a series of pulses applied to the state machine s .

In various aspects in pixel digital processing circuitry for a given pixel may be controllable to function in one of multiple possible operating modes to provide various processing functionality in connection with a received series of pulses. Furthermore respective in pixel digital processing circuitry of multiple pixels in an array similarly may be controlled to provide various processing functionality independently of one another such that similar or different digital processing functionality may be realized amongst multiple pixels in the array.

More specifically some embodiments of the present invention include digital focal plane arrays DFPAs with multiple unit cells each of which includes an analog to digital converter ADC coupled to multiple independently controllable counters. The ADC converts analog data such as photocurrent from a detector array to digital data that is counted by and stored in the independently controllable counters.

For the purposes of the present disclosure a plurality of independently controllable counters is a set of two or more counting elements in which the operating mode of each counting element can be selected regardless of the operating mode of the other counting element s in the plurality of independent controllable counters. In other words the setting of an independently controllable counter in a given unit cell is not contingent on the setting of any other counter in the given unit cell.

Illustrative counters can be controlled independently by logic in the form of respective control signals and or respective switches as described below. For instance logic in the unit cell may activate and deactivate the counters in the unit cell and shift data among the counters in the unit cell. The logic in conjunction with inter cell transfer circuitry can also shift data from the counters in one cell to counters in other unit cells and or to external memory or external processors. For more on transferring data among unit cells see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0075888 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010 0226495 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The independently controllable counters in inventive DFPAs can be used to apply one or more temporal filters facial filters and or spatial temporal filters simultaneously to imagery directly on the focal plane. For example the counters in an inventive DFPA may implement multiple matched spatial filters to find signals of interest within an image. Inventive DFPAs may also perform focal plane intensity thresholding of match filtered images to eliminate irrelevant information such as background signal or static elements. Matched filtering intensity thresholding and other processing capabilities of inventive DFPAs can be used to reduce off chip data rates and processing needs for sensors and systems. In addition inventive DFPAs can also be used to reduce the size s of sensors and sensing systems because they eliminate the need for external processors.

A multiplexer coupled to the ADC receives the pulses and couples the pulses to a set of independent controllable digital counters depending on the state of a binary control signal CLSEL. When the binary control signal CLSEL is in a first state e.g. a logical high state the multiplexer couples an externally provided read out clock signal ROCLK to the counters to shift data out of the counters as described below. When the binary control signal CL SEL is in a second state e.g. a logical low state the multiplexer couples the pulses to one or more of the counters .

Each counter may increment or decrement its respective count in response to the pulses depending on its respective state which is set by signal processing logic and control logic . The counters store the accumulated pulses or counts as digital data that can be shifted among counters in the unit cell and transferred out of the unit cell . Exemplary counters can be implemented by grouping together D flips flops in an asynchronous ripple counter that can also be used as a shift register to shift data into adjacent unit cells by asserting the binary control signal CLKSEL and providing the external readout clock ROCLK as described above. When the counters are in shift register mode orthogonal transfer circuitry couples digital data stored in the counters via an output buffer described below according to instructions from the signal processing logic and or control logic .

Depending on the operating mode the configuration multiplexer selects one of the following input signals QOUT which is the output of the unit cell QINT which is the output of the D flip flop QBARINT which is the complement of the output of the D flip flop DIN which receives data from another counter in the unit cell and or from other unit cells in the DFPA BINH which is an arithmetic shift right operation and BINL which is a rotate left operation . . . . Similarly the clock selection multiplexer selects between the counter clock CTRCLK and read out clock ROCLK. Other independently controllable counter architectures fall within the scope of the present invention including independently controllable counters with more flip flops e.g. to store more than one bit of data storage elements other than flip flops and or different switching arrangements. In addition other counters may include multiplexers with fewer or more inputs depending on the desired application.

The control inputs to the multiplexers and set the counter to operate in any of the operating modes listed in TABLE 1 below . The operating mode determines which of the two clocks and six data inputs feed into the flip flop . The first letter of the operating mode name corresponds to the input clock C is for the ripple counter clock and S corresponds to the readout or shift clock. The counter clock is used for counting operations when integrating photocurrent and the readout clock is used for shifting data into adjacent pixels and performing other synchronous operations.

The subsequent letter s of each mode name correspond to the data input selected by the configuration multiplexer using the one hot select signal DCTRL . Region of interest ROI mode is for a region of interest write operation described in greater detail below. The input for this mode comes from the bidirectional QOUT bus. When the ROI tristate buffer is tristated the QOUT bus is driven with ROI write data by the QCOL and QROW buses rather than the value stored in the D flip flop . QBAR inputs the negated version of the flip flop output to toggle the D flip flop . Q inputs the positive version of the flip flop output so that the D flip flop holds state regardless of the clock input. This is a safe mode that can be used when the clock inputs are changed to prevent unexpected clock pulses. DIN is for the external data input which shifts in data from an adjacent unit cell and can be used for an OTS shift or to read data out of the array. BINH is for an arithmetic shift right ASR and BINL is for a rotate left ROL . Both are part of the barrel shifter functionality.

The MODE signal is the external input that is used to control the counting mode. The MODE control signal includes six bits of which the lower four control the counter clock and input data. The upper two bits select the orthogonal shift direction. DCTRL and CLKSEL are both internal signals that are generated from MODE . DCTRL is a one hot control signal which selects one of the six flip flop inputs. CLKSEL selects between the ripple counter clock and the readout clock. When CLKSEL is high the pixel is in readout mode when it is low the pixel is in counter mode. Note that CLKSEL corresponds directly to MODE .

The sixteen modes listed in TABLE 1 implement significant functionality for the independently controllable counter and the unit cell that includes the counter . The CQBAR mode is used for normal counting operation when reading data from the photodiode array. The SROI mode is used to write data from the ROI row and column buses into a pixel. The SQBAR mode is used to toggle the counter for a ones complement negation.

The SDIN mode shifts data in from an adjacent pixel. The shift direction is determined by MODE . The SBINH mode is used to perform an arithmetic right shift and the SBINL mode is used to perform a left rotate. The CQ and SQ modes are used as safe modes when the input clock is changed. For example if the counter is operating in CQBAR mode to change to SQBAR mode one can first change to CQ mode then SQ mode then SQBAR to ensure that the counter sees only the intended clock pulse. To ensure that more than one DCTRL bit is not selected during a transient condition the COPEN and SOPEN mode should be used as an intermediate step between mode transitions.

Setting one hot control signals DCTRL and CLKSEL to choose input QBARINT and the counter clock CTR CLK puts the counter into an asynchronous ripple counter mode in which it accepts the complement output from another counter in the same unit cell . For shift register operation the one hot control signals DCTRL and CLKSEL are set to choose input DIN and the shift register read out clock RO CLK and for synchronous complement the one hot control signals DCTRL and CLKSEL are set to input QBARINT and shift register read out clock RO CLK. The input QINT can be used to avoid unwanted data corruption during mode transitions as any spurious clock edges then have no effect. In other examples the counter may operate in a count up mode in which it increments its stored count in response to a pulse a count down mode in which it decrements its stored count in response to a pulse an inactive or sleep mode in which it does not respond to pulses and or a shift mode in which it transfers data via an inverter and a pair of tristate buffers and which can be used to gate the counter output as described below.

Referring again to two paths in the counter are illustrated a count mode path dot dash line and a readout mode path dotted line . In count mode CQBAR the inverter provides an output QBARINT which is the complement of the flip flop output Q feeds back into the data input D of the D flip flop . In some counting modes the counter clock CLK may be supplied by the output from another counter in the unit cell. In an asynchronous ripple counting mode for instance two or more independently controllable counters may be arranged in series such that the output of the first counter in the series serves as the input to the second counter in the chain and so on. Alternatively the input to the counter clock CLK may be one or more pulses from the ADC . In readout mode SDIN the shift clock is active and the flip flop input D is set to the DIN bus which is connected to the OTS tristate inverter of an adjacent counter in the same unit cell.

The counter shown in performs bidirectional counting using ones complement synchronous negation instead of performing an up down count operation. Specifically the counter performs a complement count complement operation to get a result equivalent to a backwards count operation. To perform ones complement negation of the counter value the D flip flop can be toggled using the QBAR input. This corresponds to counter mode SQBAR or readout clock with negated input. For background subtraction or change detection the counter can be configured to count up and then count down each for the same integration period. To count up the normal counting mode is used. To count down the value of the counter is negated using one s complement and counting continues. A second ones complement negation completes the down counting operation to restore the D flip flop s positive value.

Alternatively replacing the complement bubble on the D flip flop with an XOR gate allows for true count down operation. In this implementation if the output of clock multiplexor is connected to one input of the XOR and a direction control signal is connected to the other input then the direction control signal can be used to choose either count up or count down operation.

The independently controllable counter also includes a first tristate inverter and a second tristate inverter that provide random access readout and synchronous shift register readout of data stored in the D flip flop . Each tristate inverter inverts the complement output signal QBARINT when its respective control signal is asserted to provide an output that matches the bit stored in the D flip flop . In shift register readout mode data is output to an adjacent counter via an output OTS OUT of the orthogonal transfer tristate inverter . In random access readout mode the counter emits data via an output QOUT of the ROI tristate buffer .

Together the inverters and form a gating circuit used to ensure that the counter does not perform any unnecessary switching activity. Enabling the second tristate inverter while clocking the counter with the read out clock RO CLK e.g. by asserting the clock select signal CLKSEL causes the second tristate inverter to output the value stored in the D flip flop when in synchronous count mode but not in asynchronous ripple count mode. Preventing the counter from broadcasting its value while it is counting is a power saving feature.

An alternative implementation that can accommodate both counting and shifting includes a logic gate such as a NAND gate instead of a tristate inverter. Referring again to the tristate inverter outputting OTS OUT can be replaced by a NAND gate with inputs QBARINT and CLKSEL. In this case the NAND gate prevents unnecessary toggles on the shift register output node OTS OUT during count mode.

To count pulses from an analog source such as the ADC in with the counter structure the clock select signal CLKSEL is set to count mode e.g. set to a logical low value and the one hot signal DCTRL selects the appropriate input signal to feed into each counter . In ripple counting mode pulses from the ADC feed the zero order counter . On the falling edge triggered clock input CTR CLK the complementary output QBAR from the zero order counter drives the input CLK of the first order counter the complementary output QBAR from the first order counter drives the clock input CLK of the second order counter and so on. The output from the highest order counter in the counter structure may coupled to another unit cell or other circuitry in the integrated circuit via one or more optional buffers if desired. Thus counter represents the least significant bit counter represents the second least significant bit and so on up to counter which represents the most significant bit.

As described above the counters in the segmented counter structure can be switched from counting mode s to read out mode by changing the clock select signal CLKSEL e.g. from a logical low value to a logical high value or vice versa. Switching the counter structure from count mode to shift mode causes the counter structure to behave as a shift register where each counter in the counter structure transfers stored data to the next counter in the counter structure e.g. counter transfers data to counter . For an integrated circuit with a six bit data bus connecting adjacent unit cells and eighteen one bit counters per unit cell it may take three clock cycles to transfer all eighteen bits from one unit cell to an adjacent unit cell other portion of the DFPA or external memory not shown .

Each segment e.g. six bit counter or nine bit counter may be implemented as one or more concatenated independently controllable counters each of which has pins for its own enable signals GATE GATE etc. . and clock inputs as described above. Because each counter can be enabled and or clocked independently of the other counters in the counter structure each counter can operate with a different integration time and or implement a different filter kernel as described below. These segments are cascaded via either the configuration multiplexers internal to each counter external multiplexers coupled between counters of the counter structure and or other additional switches which allows each subsequent segment to be clocked by either the MSB of the previous segment or an independent external clock.

Alternatively the segments may be clocked independently with the output of one or more ADCs. For a unit cell with an ADC that includes a current to frequency converter voltage to frequency converter or other pulse emitting ADC the external clocks CLK CLK etc. may correspond to pulses emitted by the ADC . In unit cells with multiple pulse emitting ADCs each clock and or each segment may be connected to the output of a different ADC.

Referring again to the configuration multiplexer in each individual independently controllable counter has a DIN port that allows for data to be shifted in e.g. from a different unit cell in the DFPA . It is also possible to use the data input port DIN to perform shift based operations including a barrel shift which is useful for performing power of two multiplication and division and for other purposes. In shift based operating modes the DIN input of each counter in the counter structure or segment of the counter structure is connected to the output of an adjacent bit next higher or lower in significance . For an arithmetic shift the counter representing the LSB or MSB is connected to a reset value e.g. ground GND which may be selected to allow for sign extension. For a rotate operation the output of the counter representing the MSB is connected to the input of the counter representing the LSB.

In barrel shift mode a group of counters in shift register mode shifts a data word by a specified number of bits in one clock cycle. The counters in the segmented counter structure can be switched to and or from barrel shift mode using the external input signal DCTRL . Specifically the lower four bits of DCTRL specify the inputs of the counters for barrel shifting. These counter modes and the corresponding values of DCTRL are given in TABLE 1. Counter mode SBINL and the BINL counter input correspond to a rotate left operation i.e. a left shift and counter mode SBINH and the BINH counter input correspond to an arithmetic shift right operation i.e. a right shift . Based on the configuration of the counter structure the bitmode signals BITMODE given in TABLE 2 select between the shift value and the counter value for correct shifting operation.

For some applications a nondestructive random access approach for reading out data is more desirable than the synchronous shift register approach described above. For example a nondestructive local query is particularly useful for reading out one or more particular regions of interest ROI or sampling the counter states at multiple sample times within a single integration period. Furthermore it may be beneficial in some signal processing applications to preload counters in one or more unit cells without changing the contents of other unit cells in the integrated circuit .

The column bus can also accommodate write operations in which data is preloaded into one or more counters in each of one or more unit cells in the read out integrated circuit . During a write operation a write circuit generates a voltage corresponding to ROI input data and couples the voltage to one or more selected unit cells in a ROI along a selected column data bus via an optional multiplexer . Referring to the tristate inverters in the selected unit cells are set to tristate mode and the control input DCTRL is set to ROI mode e.g. using the row decoder . In other words the configuration multiplexer in each selected unit cell is set clock data on input QOUT from the QOUT node of the tristate inverter into the D flop flop . The row decoder may be used to locally configure the input DCTRL so that one or more rows of unit cells are set to receive the input QOUT while the other unit cells in the integrated circuit are set to receive the input QINT.

DFPAs with multiple independently controllable counters per unit cell can be used to filter incident signals in the time domain by incrementing decrementing and or transferring data among counters in each unit cell and or among counters in different unit cells. They also enable new sensing modalities such as coherent detection for improved receiver sensitivity and optical dispersion compensation. For example the simultaneous application of temporally matched filters in one or more unit cells can be used to estimate the amplitude and phase of one or more pixel or groups of pixels in a signal image e.g. through in phase and quadrature demodulation described below .

On chip spatial filtering can be implemented using the up down counting and array shifting functions. Additionally in pixel temporal matched filters can be utilized to detect intermediate frequency signals while rejecting out of band noise and or clutter components. To enable parallel execution of multiple processing functions e.g. dual in phase and quadrature detection in the case of coherent detection or the implementation of multiple spatial filters in image processing applications the counters in each unit cell of the DFPA can be split N times producing N 1 separate counter segments and each counter segment can be driven by the same ADC as described above. The integration and up down counting of each counter can be independently controlled.

Specifically inventive DFPAs can be used as temporally matched filters in heterodyne and or homodyne detection in which light from a laser or other light source is reflected from an object or otherwise modulated to produce a signal beam that is imaged onto an array of photodetectors in a focal plane. As understood by those of skill in the art reflection may introduce a Doppler shift or other modulation in the signal beam depending on the object s position and velocity with respect to the focal plane. Additional light from the laser is optically combined with the reflected light and interferes with the reflected light at the focal plane. This additional light which may be delayed and or shifted in frequency is known as the local oscillator beam. Optical mixing at each detector in the focal plane results in an analog photocurrent whose frequency which is referred to as the intermediate frequency IF is about equal to the difference between the frequencies of the local oscillator and signal beams and whose amplitude is proportional to the amplitude of the electric field of the signal beam.

A lens collimates the transmitted beam which is polarized in the plane of the page as it propagates out of the fiber through a polarizing beamsplitter which transmits the entire beam . A quarter wave plate rotates the polarization of the transmitted beam to a circular polarization state e.g. left handed circular before the transmitted beam is projected onto a target via a zoom lens which compensates for changes in range to the target and an iris which limits the amount of light coupled back into the system . The target reflects a portion of the incident light to form a reflected beam with a polarization orthogonal to that of the transmitted beam i.e. if the transmitted beam has left handed circular polarization then the reflected beam has right handed circular polarization . This reflected beam propagates back through the iris and zoom lens to the quarter wave plate which rotates the reflected beam s polarization to be perpendicular to the plane of the page. The polarizing beamsplitter then reflects the reflected beam onto the focal plane of a DFPA .

At the same time a fiber beamsplitter couples a fraction of the light from the laser through an isolator which prevents reflections from reaching the laser and an attenuator that reduces the beam s amplitude. A lens collimates this additional beam which is known as a local oscillator and polarized in the plane of the page with a half wave plate and directs it toward the DFPA . As understood by those of skill in the art the local oscillator may be frequency shifted with respect to the transmitted beam using e.g. an AOM or other frequency shifter. In this case the first and second AOMs and introduce an equivalent shift of the frequency in the transmitted beam instead. The difference in frequency between the local oscillator and the transmitted beam is referred to as the intermediate frequency.

The reflected beam and the local oscillator interfere with each other on the photodetector array in the DFPA . The non linear square law detection process performed at each photodetector in the DFPA results in a sinusoidal signal whose amplitude is proportional to the amplitude of the reflected light and whose frequency is about equal to the intermediate frequency here 5 MHz plus or minus phase shifts due to movement of and or range delay to the target .

Temporal filtering within each unit cell pixel in the DFPA can be used to demodulate the intermediate frequency signals and extract the amplitude and phase of the reflected beam . In particular applying an in phase temporal filter represented by a square wave which can be implemented using up down counting commands modulated at the intermediate frequency and a quadrature temporal filter given by a square wave modulated at the intermediate frequency phase and shifted by 90 degrees relative to the in phase filter signal yields the in phase and quadrature components of the reflected beam . The signal amplitude can be estimated from its detected in phase and quadrature components as I Q the signal phase can estimated by the arctangent of the in phase and quadrature values.

A photodetector operably coupled to the unit cell transmits an analog photocurrent to a current to frequency converter via a first transistor a variable capacitor a second transistor a capacitor an integrator and an XOR gate all described in greater detail below . The output of the current to frequency converter is applied simultaneously to the in phase counter and quadrature counter via a multiplexor not shown . Each counter and can be controlled to count up or down in many ways such as using control signals CTL I and CTL Q to allow independent gating or actuation of the clock signals for each counter . Digital data stored in each counter can be transferred independently to adjacent units cells e.g. by selecting the appropriate counter operating modes and using the synchronous shift and or random access techniques described above.

In pixel in phase and quadrature demodulation is accomplished as follows. A clock not shown generates a sinusoid at the intermediate frequency which is rectified to produce an in phase control signal CTL I and a rectified phase shifted quadrature control signal CTL Q as shown in . The in phase counter is toggled between count up and count down modes at a rate equal to the expected signal IF and the quadrature phase counter is toggled as above with a 90 degree phase lag with respect to the in phase counter . In this way the values of the in phase and quadrature counters correspond to the expected in phase and quadrature signals after the allotted signal integration time.

where Requals the target rate in m s is the phase difference between pulses in a given pulse par in rad Tis the separation between pulses in a given pulse pair in s and is the wavelength wavelength of the transmitted beam in m .

In this experiment the wavelength was 1550 nm and pulse pair separation was about 150 s which resulted in an unambiguous target rate equal to 2.6 mm s. The target rates were varied between 0 and 4 mm s hence observed wrap around at rates greater than 2.6 mm s . The target was imaged onto a small number of detectors unit cells and the rate estimates were averaged over multiple pulse pairs to improve the signal to noise ratio.

Switching a counter between modes of operations e.g. from count up mode to count down mode may involve preventing the counter from perform operations such as negation. Consider the following example implementation of in phase and quadrature components in two register banks

Note that the transitions between count directions do not occur at the same time for both counters. If for example backward counting is implemented using a negate count negate method and if pixel area constraints require the sharing of some of the control signals for both banks then it may be desirable to stop the counting in the in phase counter when switching the operating mode of the quadrature counter. This extra transition can induce unwanted dead time and or noise.

Referring again to the unit cell includes a variable capacitor with a high capacitance mode and a low capacitance mode in the photocurrent injection path that mitigates unwanted dead time and or noise. One way to implement this variable capacitor is by using a metal oxide semiconductor capacitor with the depletion state used for low capacitance mode and either the accumulation or inversion region used for high capacitance mode. During normal count operation the variable capacitor is kept in low capacitance mode. During a mode transition the variable capacitor is switched to high capacitance mode and photocurrent is integrated onto the variable capacitor while the mode transition takes place. Then once back in count mode the variable capacitor returns to low capacitance mode and discharges any integrated photocurrent collected during the mode transition into the current to frequency converter .

In addition to the temporal kernels described above DPFAs with multiple independently controllable counters per unit call can also implement spatial kernels using a combination of orthogonal shifting and bidirectional counting. A Roberts Cross filter as used e.g. for edge detection may be implemented by applying the kernels shown in the insets of FIGS. A and lB to two different counters in a single unit cell. These kernels may be implemented on the readout using the sequence of operations described below. Then the resulting digital values in each register may be used to compute edge angles and edge gradients in the scene.

Implementing a Roberts Cross filter involves a one time setup followed by a series of execution steps repeated once per frame. Setup includes setting the size of the least significant bit in an N bit segmented counter structure then partitioning the counter structure into the a pair of N 2 bit counter segments referred to herein as Registers A and B . The Roberts Cross filter is executed every frame by zeroing the counter segments then integrating pulses in each counter segment for half the integration period T 2 to give a count in Register A of T 2 I LSB and a count in Register B of T 2 I LSB . Next the count in Register A is shifted up by one unit cell and left one by unit cell and the count in Register B is shifted up one by unit cell and right by one unit cell. Data is also shifted into Registers A and B from adjacent unit cells. The counts in both registers are negated i.e. switched in sign before Registers A and B integrate for the second half of the integration period T 2 to give a count in Register A of T II LSB and a count in Register B of T II LSB. The resulting N bit image is read out for evaluation and if desired further processing.

The design elements described above may be used in conjunction with additional logic to allow for the implementation of a wide variety of mathematical and signal processing features.

DFPA has the ability to take the absolute value of the counter register contents and perform left and right shifts using a barrel shifter. These functions are implemented at the pixel level and can be performed on the digitized imager data in real time.

Referring to a control signal ABS is defined to allow selection of the absolute value function. A logic function such as the following can then be used to selectively complement pixels or register segments with negative data ENABLE NOT ABS OR ABS AND MSB . Here ENABLE is intended to be used to gate the synchronous clock. In this case if ABS is asserted the clock will only be seen by the register logic if the MSB of the register i.e. the sign bit is high.

The absolute value operation described above may be considered to be a conditional clock gating applied to the case of a negation operation. This may be used more generally. For example consider a unit cell with a six bit counter and a twelve bit counter. The conditional clock gating approach applied in the absolute value operation can be used to multiply or divide the value in the twelve bit register by a power of two based on the MSB in the six bit register.

We can also perform a thresholding operation. Consider the case in which we have a single N bit counter. We first initialize the counter to a negative value the complement of the threshold . We then perform our integration step counting up proportionate to photocurrent. Finally we use the MSB to gate a synchronous clock in zero operation. Any counter that has not crossed the zero point and thus still contains a negative value will be reset to zero.

A control state machine decodes and executes the instructions in the RAM to generate the low level control signals. The control state machine is a system that includes a finite number of states and transitions between states. A transition is a set of actions that begins in one state and ends in another state or the same state. A transition is triggered by an event or a condition. An implementation of a state machine is in a digital circuit. For example a state machine can be built using an integrated circuit programmable logic device a programmable logic controller logic gates and flip flops or relays. An example of a hardware implementation of a state machine can include a register that stores state variables combinational logic that determines state transitions and combinational logic that determines the output of the state machine.

The command and control system provides a command and control interface CCI is that of a very long word instruction set architecture VLWISA in which the read out integrated circuit in the DFPA is treated as a single instruction multiple data SIMD processor. TABLE 3 lists an example instruction set used by the CCI to communicate with the read out integrated circuit .

The instructions in TABLE 3 may be used to perform signal processing. For example the instructions can be used to implement shift photocurrent integration and or data negation as described below. To shift data from north to south by one unit when the clock gating signal is asserted for the applicable counters the command and control system may transmit the following instructions to the integrated circuit 

Similar instructions may be implemented to shift data in other directions e.g. east west or the ISA may be extended to allow for MODE to be set to a value resident in variable memory. To integrate photocurrent the command and control system may transmit the following instructions to the integrated circuit 

Varying the time that the counter is connected to the oscillator clock changes the counter s integration period. To negate data stored in a counter the command and control system may transmit the following instructions to the integrated circuit 

It is possible to implement a wide range of linear static kernel filters by combining the orthogonal data transfer capability bidirectional integration ones complement negation variable integration times and barrel shift functions of the integrated circuit . One simple example that leverages register segmentation capability is a Roberts Cross computation as described above with respect to .

To compute a Roberts Cross two kernels are convolved with the input image. This operation can be implemented using the following operations expressed in terms of the instruction set and subroutines described previously. Some initialization steps are not shows including partitioning of the 16 bit pixel register into two 8 bit registers and preloading the array shift in registers with all zeros so that all pixels are loaded with zeros as data is shifted out.

Next the integrated circuit performs shift operations on the upper and lower segments of the counter. Register A bits data shift up and left by one pixel. Register B bits data shift up and right by one pixel 

The data collected in the previous integration cycle correspond to the negative component of the kernel. Hence the integrated circuit negates the data globally then integrates to collect data corresponding to the positive component of the kernel.

A full frame can be readout or a local query can be performed for a region of interest and a decision can be made based on the reduced information set contained therein. During the readout process the edge gradient and edge angle can be computed in the readout path on the FPGA board using the following equations Edge gradient Edge angle tan 

The command and control system may also instruct the integrated circuit to perform an I Q detection operation with the parameters T intermediate frequency period N number of IF periods to be collected per frame and PGi PULSEGATE signal for bit I e.g. PG0 is the PULSEGATE signal for the lower bits and PG8 is the PULSEGATE signal for the upper bits . At time zero the array is configured to a predetermined state e.g. a segmented configuration initialized to a zero value . Some initialization steps are not shown or explicitly stated below including configuring the sixteen bit counter structure into two eight bit registers and preloading the array shift in registers with all zeros. For the purpose of discussion the in phase channel I channel and quadrature channel Q channel are represented by the lower eight bits and upper eight bits of the sixteen bit counter structure respectively. In addition the subroutine INTEGRATE PHOTOCURRENT is defined to integrate for T 4 minus a slight correction time representing the elapsed time associated with operations such as digital negation and register reconfiguration.

First the integrated circuit begins an outer loop that implements the repetition of the I Q collect timing for N. Each part of the loop begins with a configuration command BCFG that sets the values of the control bits. Function calls following the configuration command always execute but are applied to only the component enabled by the preceding configuration command.
