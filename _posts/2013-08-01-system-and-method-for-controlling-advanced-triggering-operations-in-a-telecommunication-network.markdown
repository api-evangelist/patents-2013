Telecommunications networks have seen very rapid advances in their numbers of users and the types of services available. In particular the combination of data orientated mobile telecommunications networks e.g. 3G 4G LTE Wi Fi etc. and feature rich smart phones and tablet devices has enabled users to consume a greater variety of services. As more users utilize these services telecommunication system operator networks must expand to meet the increase in user demand support the array of new services and provide fast reliable communications. This expansion has greatly increased the complexity of wireless and cellular networks and the efficient management of network traffic is becoming an ever more challenging task.

Another recent development within the computing and telecommunications industries has been the proliferation of mobile devices that are capable of performing Machine to Machine M2M communications. Such devices may communicate and interact with other devices to accomplish a variety of tasks all without any direct involvement of human users or operators. Yet unlike conventional M2M devices mobile M2M capable devices are not always tethered to the network via physical connection. Rather these devices may communicate using wireless or the cellular telephone networks such as 3G 4G LTE and UMTS networks.

As M2M capable devices continue to grow in popularity and use telecommunication network providers must develop improved solutions for managing the increases in network traffic caused by the use of such devices. Therefore improved solutions for managing triggers and signaling traffic to ensuring efficient traffic flow reduce network congestion and allow for the proper compensation of the telecommunication network operators providers for the use of their networks by M2M devices will be beneficial to consumer and telecommunication network operators.

The various embodiments include methods of communicating triggers in a telecommunication network including receiving in a processor a trigger communication message from a source device the trigger communication message including trigger parameters and information suitable for causing a destination device to automatically initiate an operation determining a criterion for sending the trigger communication message to the destination device based on the trigger parameters included in the trigger communication message monitoring a condition to determine whether the criterion has been satisfied and sending the trigger communication message to the destination device when it is determined that the criterion has been satisfied.

In an embodiment determining the criterion for sending the trigger communication message to the destination device includes scheduling the trigger communication message for transmission at a future time and monitoring a condition to determine whether the criterion has been satisfied includes monitoring a clock to determine whether a current time is equal to the future time at which the trigger communication message is scheduled for transmission.

In recent years there has been an increase in the popularity and use of machine to machine herein M2M user equipment devices. M2M devices may be user equipment devices or network components that communicate and interact with other M2M devices to accomplish a task without the direct involvement of human users or operators. These devices often communicate via wireless or the cellular telephone communications networks and thus create new challenges for telecommunication service providers and network operators herein collectively network operator .

As the popularity and use of M2M devices continues to increase triggers and signaling communications are expected to consume a significant amount of the network s available bandwidth and cause network congestion. A trigger may be a communication signal or message that includes information suitable for causing a receiving device or component to initiate an action or perform an operation in response to receiving the communication signal message. For example a trigger may include information suitable for causing a user equipment device to wake up so that voice or data communications with that device may commence.

M2M devices typically communicate a large number of triggers across the network which may result in a significant increase in network traffic and or place additional demands on the network as the use of M2M proliferates without generating additional revenue for the network operator. Further to meet the increases in usage and demand network operators may be required to update their networks and or the policies by which M2M devices are allowed to access and use their networks services. Yet using conventional solutions this requires that the network operators make significant centralized changes to their network infrastructures. Such significant and or centralized changes may impose a significant cost burden on the network operators.

The various embodiments provide intelligent efficient and cost effective solutions for managing the network traffic caused by trigger and signaling communications of M2M devices. The various embodiments include network components configured to allow network operators to better manage the unique traffic characteristics of M2M devices and their communications ensure efficient traffic flow and avoid excessive network congestion from triggers and or signaling communications generated by M2M devices all without requiring significant modifications to the existing network infrastructure of the operator networks.

Various embodiments may include components configured to generate modify augment communicate and or manage the triggers and signaling communications so that they may be processed and communicated in a more intelligent efficient and or cost effective manner than that which is available via conventional solutions. The network component may also be configured to allow network operators to implement a wide array of subscription or billing plans for the triggers and signalling communications of M2M devices thereby allowing network operators to better meet their customers usage needs while increasing revenue reducing network traffic and congestion and improving the performance of the network.

Generally M2M communications are performed between two or more M2M devices e.g. an M2M application server and an M2M user equipment device . These M2M communications may include trigger communication messages that include information suitable for causing a receiving M2M device to wake up connect to the network receive information send information to another M2M device or perform other similar operations. However M2M devices typically communicate via a wireless telecommunication network and not direct communication links. As a result one or more of the components in the telecommunications network must receive process and or route the trigger communication messages to and from the M2M devices. In existing wireless telecommunication networks these operations are performed without taking into consideration the network s state congestion balance information relative priority of the trigger time of day or other intelligent factors or network conditions. As a result existing wireless telecommunication networks are not configured for efficiently or intelligently managing the additional network traffic that will result from the increase in the number and use of the M2M devices.

Various embodiments include components configured to take into consideration any or all such factors when generating processing managing transmitting forwarding and or routing trigger communication messages. For example a network component may be configured to communicate with various components nodes in the network to receive information suitable for intelligently determining a time period during which a trigger communication message should be transmitted to a destination M2M device so as to accomplish the function of the trigger while reducing network congestion and improving the performance of the network. The network component may also be configured to intelligently communicate the trigger communication message so as to ensure that the network M2M user equipment devices and or M2M application servers all receive a level of service that is commensurate with their operating usage or load requirements.

In an embodiment the network component may be an M2M engagement engine MEE component. In various embodiments the MEE component may be configured to request and receive information from a policy management system a subscriber database a charging system or any other similar node component in the network. In various embodiments the MEE component may be configured to use information received from a policy management system and or a charging system to determine whether a trigger communication message should be communicated to a M2M device based on the network s state or congestion level the subscriber s balance information the relative priority of the trigger time of day and or other similar factors. In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to send the trigger communication message using signaling communication technologies protocols or channels. In another embodiment the MEE component may be configured to send a trigger communication message using data or content communication technologies protocols or channels.

In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to augment a trigger communication message to include additional information such as trigger parameters that may be used by other components in the operator network to intelligently determine the criteria that should be met before the trigger communication message is sent to the destination M2M device. The criteria may be used to determine when or under what network operating conditions the trigger communication message should be sent so that the trigger accomplishes its intended functionality the subscribers receive the most cost effective rate network congestion is reduced and or performance of the network is improved.

The various embodiments may be implemented within a variety of communication systems an example of which is illustrated in . A typical communication system includes user equipment devices configured to send and receive voice data and control signals to and from a service network and ultimately the Internet and or a content provider via a communications network .

The enforcement of policies may also include querying coordinating removing revoking and or adjusting various resources e.g. network resources subscriber resources etc. based on the policy rules.

The PCEF component may also be configured to send signaling information e.g. control plane information relating to communication setup security authentication charging enforcement of policy rules etc. to a policy control rules function PCRF component online offline charging system OCS OFCS components a M2M engagement engine MEE component and other similar components that participate in collect information from or otherwise contribute to communications between the service network and the user equipment .

The MEE component may be configured to communicate with the PCRF component the OCS OFCS component and or other similar components to receive information regarding current or predicted future network states network traffic volumes network congestion traffic metering subscriber profiles policy rules priorities balance information etc. The MEE component may receive and use such information to determine whether a signaling or trigger communication message should be sent to a user equipment device. The MEE component may also use this information to determine a time period during which a signaling or trigger communication message should be sent to a user equipment device to reduce network congestion while providing the user equipment device with a satisfactory level of service.

The components may communicate using a standardized protocol such as the Diameter protocol remote authentication dial in user service RADIUS protocol or any other protocol. For example in an embodiment the components may be configured to communicate via the Diameter protocol which is an extensible protocol that provides a general mechanism for two or more components nodes in a network to communicate signaling information e.g. communications involving call setup security authentication charging enforcement of policy rules .

The MEE component may be configured to provide a combination of the functionalities typically provided in 3GPP network by a Services Capability Server SCS and a Machine Type Communications Interworking Function MTC IWF server. The MEE component may also be configured to provide the functionally typically provided in an ETSI network by a Service Capability Layer SCL component.

The MEE component may also be configured communicate with one or more M2M application servers in the M2M service provider domain .

In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to operate as an intermediary component or interface between an M2M application server and an M2M device . For example the MEE component may be configured to receive a trigger communication message from an M2M application server determine the type of radio access network to which a destination M2M device is attached select an appropriate control plane manager component based on the radio access network type request and receive information from various components in the network generate signaling information based on the trigger communication message and information received from the components in the network and send the generated signaling information to the selected control plane manager component for forwarding to the destination M2M device .

In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to augment a trigger communication message received from an M2M application server which may be accomplished by adding information to the received trigger communication message. For example the MEE component may be configured to add trigger parameters and or generated received signaling information to the trigger communication message and send this augmented trigger communication message to the selected control plane manager component for forwarding to an M2M device . The MEE component may be configured to send the generated signaling information and or trigger communication message to the control plane manager component via the control plane e.g. in a signaling message etc. or the data plane e.g. in a content message such as an SMS .

Each control plane manager component may be configured to receive signaling information and or a trigger communication message from the MEE component perform various operations to identify and select the destination M2M device and send the signaling information and or trigger communication message to the selected M2M device . A control plane manager component may send this information message to the selected M2M device in a signaling message e.g. via the control plane or in a content message e.g. via the data plane .

The M2M device may be configured to perform various operations in response to receiving signaling information and or trigger communication messages from the control plane manager component . For example in response to receiving a trigger communication message the M2M device may establish open a connection e.g. a data plane connection to the M2M application server so that the M2M device and M2M application server may exchange communicate application level information.

As mentioned above the MEE component may be configured to interact with the various components within the M2M device domain mobile network operator domain and M2M service provider domain . Interactions between the MEE component and the components in the M2M device domain and the M2M service provider domain may be accomplished via networks e.g. WAN or the Internet and or through defined ports or URLs. In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to operate as a firewall between the components in the mobile network operator domain and the devices components in the other domains .

In the various embodiments the MEE component may be configured to interface with the device domain through Internet protocol e.g. HTTP SOAP TLS etc. or legacy communication links such as simple message service SMS and interface with the M2M service provider domain via Internet protocol e.g. HTTP SOAP TLS etc. . In various embodiments the MEE component may be configured to communicate with the PMS component and with the OCS component . The MEE component may also be configured to communicate with the off line charging system components which may be accomplished using the Ga and Rf message interfaces. The MEE component may be further configured to communicate with various components in an authorization authentication and access control AAA domain to provide M2M security bootstrapping via RADIUS or Diameter communication technologies.

This may include the management of the number of M2M devices the amount of storage consumed within the MEE component the number of processors required within the MEE component and the amount of memory consumed by the MEE component .

The application management module may be configured to perform various operations to manage application lifecycles and to support enablement and routing operations. The API directory module may be configured to store and manage various interfaces for interacting with third party application servers M2M devices and M2M application servers as well as manage subscriber groups group aliases organization units etc. The developer resource module may be configured to manage the interfaces to various developer resources.

The MEE component may include an analytics engine not shown to record and provide basic logging and statistical information relating to M2M devices . Additionally the analytics engine may be configured to use logging information in conjunction with additional contextual information obtained from other components within the telecommunications operator s network to generate semantically aware information.

The M2M identity management module may be configured to provide the system with a scalable identity management solution that is suitable for use with M2M devices M2M services and M2M communications. That is the ubiquity of M2M devices combined with the expected proliferation of M2M services is likely to put the existing mobile network identity management systems under severe pressure because these identity management systems were not intended to be scalable. Furthermore existing identity management systems are designed for managing identities that are tightly coupled to individual subscribers and thus are associated with a large set of metadata and change infrequently. In contrast identities used with M2M services may not be associated with individual subscribers and they may have very short life spans. By including an M2M identity management module in the MEE component the various embodiments provide improved identity management solutions that are scalable and suitable for use with current and future M2M devices and services.

For example M2M devices may have identity values e.g. A B and C that are dependent on either their hardware e.g. MAC address SIM Integrated Circuit Cart Identifier ICCID or virtualised hardware e.g. a virtual SIM . The M2M identity management module may store and use these identity values to accomplish route the communications between the M2M devices and the MEE component .

The M2M identity management module may be configured to associate every M2M device with zero or more M2M services each of which may be provided by one or more M2M application servers . Each of these associations may be initiated by the M2M device owner or the M2M service provider as part of the service invocation or using an out of band mechanism.

As part of associating an M2M device with an M2M service the M2M identity management module may create a pseudonym identity that is suitable for use in accomplishing the communications between an M2M device and the M2M application server . For example the MM identity management module may create the pseudonym identities of A A and A for an M2M device having an M2M device identity of A. Each of these pseudonym identities may be bound to a hardware based identity e.g. A which may be accomplished by using the identity of the M2M service provider or the identity of the M2M service if a single M2M service provider can provide multiple M2M services . This relationship between hardware based identities M2M service providers and pseudonym identities is shown in the table 1 below.

The M2M identity management module may be configured to allow the MEE component to communicate with an M2M device using a hardware based identity and with an M2M application server using a pseudonym identity. That is since all communications between the M2M device and the M2M application servers pass through the MEE component the M2M identity management module may substitute hardware based identities with pseudonym identities and vice versa to facilitate M2M communications between these components.

A single pseudonym identity may be used to communicate information between a single M2M device and multiple M2M application servers such as in scenarios where the M2M device owner wishes to allow multiple M2M application servers to collaborate to provide an enhanced service. For example the owner of an M2M device embedded in a car may be willing to allow both a server managed by a local dealership e.g. where the car was purchased and a server managed by the manufacturer of the car to collaboratively share information that is obtained from an M2M device within the car. In such scenarios the M2M identity management module may use a single pseudonym identity e.g. A to communicate with multiple M2M application servers .

In an embodiment the M2M identity management module may be configured to allow the MEE component to associate two or more M2M devices together to form a M2M device group. The service provider may subsequently treat this device group as a single entity from a device management point of view. For example a service provider that provides a vehicle tracking service may create device groups for each of emergency service vehicles e.g. ambulances fire brigades etc. corporate fleet vehicles and private vehicles. The service provider may then incorporate these device groups into policies within the MEE component such as the service provider may create a policy that prioritizes data received from the emergency service vehicle device group over the other device groups.

In an embodiment the M2M identity management module may be configured to allow M2M device owners and or M2M service providers to create group based pseudonym identities in which each group identity is mapped to two or more pseudonym identities and hardware based identities. The M2M identity management module may be configured to associate multiple independent M2M service identities with a single hardware identity e.g. A A and A may all be associated with A . This enables multiple M2M service providers to use a single M2M device without being able to correlate their data based upon the device identity.

The use of pseudonym identities by the M2M identity management module provides a number of benefits over existing solutions. First it prevents the M2M application servers from obtaining the real identity i.e. the hardware based identity of the M2M devices which provides the M2M device with greater privacy and prevents two or more nefarious M2M service providers from colluding by correlating information using a common identity. In addition the pseudonym identity can be destroyed when the M2M device is no longer associated with a particular M2M service or M2M application server without impacting other M2M services used by the M2M device . This provides an additional level of security and privacy for the M2M device without impacting the performance of the network. Further the use of a pseudonym identity allows the network operator to use any internal M2M device addressing scheme without having to consider its impact on M2M service providers or M2M application servers . In addition the use of pseudonym identities allows the system to substitute one M2M device for another e.g. due to a hardware failure without impacting the M2M service providers or M2M application servers .

In various embodiments the M2M identity management module may be configured to allow M2M device owners to manage e.g. create revoke etc. their M2M device identities using a web interface a device based user interface an API etc.

The trigger scheduling module may be configured to intelligently schedule trigger communications for transmission so the system is not required to rely on third party M2M application servers to send triggers at the correct time or under the correct conditions. The M2M application servers may send the trigger communication messages to the MEE component and the MEE component may communicate with other components in the network to receive information suitable for use in determining an optimal time or way to communicate the trigger message to minimize network traffic and congestion. Based on this information and information included in the trigger communication message the MEE component may determine to send the trigger communication message immediately schedule the trigger communication message for transmission at a future date time or reject the trigger by not transmitting the trigger communication message. This simplifies the operations that are required to be performed by M2M application servers and improves the overall performance of the network.

In an embodiment the trigger scheduling module may be configured to use contextual information to treat individual trigger communication messages or individual groups of communication messages differently. The trigger scheduling module may be configured to obtain the contextual information from the trigger communication message from a network database or from the other components in the network. This contextual information may include information identifying a trigger priority e.g. level from 1 to 5 or a time value range or period in which the trigger must be communicated. This contextual information may also include information identifying an amount of data that the trigger will generate the types of data that the trigger may generate a maximum amount that the third party is willing to pay for communicating the trigger balance information e.g. a monetary balance or a usage balance subscriber profiles e.g. gold silver bronze group based information relating to the group of devices to which a target M2M device belongs current network congestion levels expected future network congestion levels cost or usage based tariff information etc. The trigger scheduling module may be configured to use any or all of such information to determine whether trigger communication messages should be sent to an M2M device when or at what time the trigger communication messages should be sent to an M2M device and or under what conditions the trigger communication messages should be sent to an M2M device.

In various embodiments the M2M device M2M application server MEE component and or other components in the network may be configured to augment trigger communication messages to include additional information such as trigger priority values maximum allowable time values expected amounts of generated data values expected types of data values e.g. once off data update versus streaming media etc. maximum cost values etc.

The trigger scheduling module may be configured to use the trigger priority values to differentiate between triggers from the same third party M2M application server and schedule the transmission of the trigger accordingly e.g. by scheduling high priority triggers to be transmitted before lower priority triggers . In an embodiment the trigger scheduling module may be configured to use the trigger priority values to accomplish the same operations that may be accomplished by 3GPP EPS bearers via a QoS Class Index QCI .

The trigger scheduling module may be configured to use the maximum allowable time values to determine the latest time that this trigger can be sent and schedule the transmission of the trigger accordingly. For example a non real time application may require that the trigger be processed sometime before the start of the next business day and thus may request that the trigger scheduling module send the trigger sometime in the next twelve hours by setting the maximum allowable time value to 12 hours. As another example a real time application that requires the trigger be processed immediately may set the maximum allowable time value to be equal to 0 which may cause the trigger scheduling module to schedule the trigger for immediate transmission.

The trigger scheduling module may be configured to use the expected amounts of generated data values to determine the amount of data that the trigger will generate and schedule the transmission of the trigger accordingly. For example a trigger to a vending machine may result in 1 KB of information being communicated across the network whereas a trigger to a security camera may result in hundreds of megabytes of data being communicated across the network. The trigger scheduling module may use this information to schedule the transmission of the trigger communication message at a time when the network can best support the additional traffic generated as a result of communicating the trigger.

The trigger scheduling module may be configured to use the maximum cost values to determine maximum amount that the third party is willing to pay for the communication of the trigger and schedule the transmission of the trigger accordingly. This allows the network operator to provide dynamically priced services based upon the operating conditions of the network such as the network utilization levels available bandwidth etc. For example the network operator may set the price for communicating trigger messages to be commensurate with the amount of bandwidth that is available in the network and the trigger scheduling module may use this information to determine not to send a trigger communication message when bandwidth is such that the price of communicating the trigger is above the maximum cost value identified in the trigger.

The trigger scheduling module may be configured to schedule the trigger communication messages for transmission based on the network state such as the overall current network congestion levels current network congestion levels of the cell area that the destination M2M device is located projected future congestion levels e.g. when the congestion is expected to go below a certain threshold . The trigger scheduling module may also be configured to schedule the trigger communication messages for transmission based on cost based tariff information which may identify a cost and or cost tolerance of communicating information across the network under certain network conditions or at certain times e.g. communicating the trigger or the expected data generated by the trigger is cheaper between the hours of 1 and 6 AM etc. .

In block the processing core may receive a communication message from an M2M device that includes a hardware based M2M device identity e.g. A of the M2M device and that is destined for an M2M application server in the M2M service provider domain . In block the processing core may determine whether a pseudonym identity should be used for the communications between the M2M device and the M2M application server .

When the processing core determines that a pseudonym identity should be used for the communications between the M2M device and the M2M application server i.e. determination block Yes in block the processing core may generate a pseudonym identity e.g. A for the M2M device . In block the processing core may update the received communication message by substituting the hardware based identity i.e. A with the generated pseudonym identity i.e. A . In block the processing core may send the updated communication message to the M2M application server which may receive the updated communication message and perform various M2M operations based on information included in the updated communication message.

In block the processing core may receive a response message from the M2M application server that includes pseudonym identity i.e. A and the results of the M2M operations performed in the M2M application server . In block the processing core may query a table or perform a hash or similar operation to identify the hardware based M2M device identity i.e. A that corresponds to the pseudonym identity i.e. A included in the received response message. In block the processing core may update the response message by substituting the pseudonym identity i.e. A with the hardware based identity i.e. A . In block the processing core may send the updated response message to the M2M device .

If the processing core determines that a pseudonym identity should not be used for the communications between the M2M device and the M2M application server determination block No in block the processing core may send the communication message to the M2M application server which may receive the communication message and perform various M2M operations. In block the processing core may receive a response message from the M2M application server that includes the hardware based M2M device identifier i.e. A and the results of the M2M operations performed in the M2M application server . In block the processing core may send the response message to the M2M device .

In block the processing core may receive a trigger communication message from an M2M device or an M2M application server . In optional block the processing core may determine whether the trigger communication message includes trigger parameters such as a trigger priority value maximum allowable time value expected amounts of generated data value expected types of data value maximum cost value etc. In optional block the processing core may request and receive information from network components deployed in the mobile network operator domain such as from an online charging system a policy management system or a congestion management system.

In block the processing core may use the trigger parameters and or information received from the network components to intelligently determine or generate criteria for sending the trigger to a destination M2M device or M2M application server . The criteria may include information suitable for determining if or when the trigger communication message should be sent. The criteria may also include information for identifying conditions or times in which the communication message should be sent. The criteria may also include information suitable for determining whether the processing core should send the trigger communication message immediately reject the trigger communication message or schedule the trigger communication message for transmission at the future time and or based on a future network condition.

In determination block the processing core may determine whether the criteria have been satisfied. In various embodiments the determination of whether the criteria have been satisfied may be time based cost based data volume based priority based group based and or based on any other information that may be made available to a MEE component . Also in determination block the processing core may determine whether the criteria for sending the trigger communication message have changed. The processing core may also determine whether the criteria have changed at certain predefined times e.g. every 5 minutes predefined levels of network utilization e.g. when human related services are less than 40 when certain other external events occur e.g. network outage etc.

When the processing core determines that the criteria has not been satisfied i.e. determination block No the processing core may wait for a period of time in block and reevaluate whether the criteria has been satisfied in block . This waiting operation may performed based upon a subscribe and notify model in which the processing core subscribes to receive notification messages such as when the network utilization goes below a certain percentage e.g. 60 and waits until it receives the notification. The processing core may also determine that the criteria will not be met e.g. the time period for receiving the notification has expired or timed out and send an error message to the M2M application server to notify it that the trigger communication message will not be transmitted.

When the processing core determines that the current criteria has been satisfied i.e. determination block Yes in block the processing core may send the trigger communication message to the destination device via the control plane manager .

In an embodiment the processing core intelligently determining generating criteria for sending the trigger to a destination M2M device or M2M application server in block may include determining generating a time based criterion. For example if a trigger parameter indicates that trigger communication message may be delayed by a maximum of twelve hours and the information received from the network components indicates that the network is currently congested the processing core may generate and set the criteria for transmitting the trigger communication message to include a transmission time that is within the next 12 hours and during which the network is expected to experience low levels of congestion e.g. 2 AM .

In an embodiment intelligently determining generating criteria may include the processing core determining generating a cost based criterion. For example if the information received from the network components indicates that the immediate transmission of the trigger communication message will cost the subscriber more than the maximum amount the subscriber is willing to pay which may be determined from the maximum cost value included in the trigger parameters the processing core may generate and set the criteria to include a network communication cost that is lower than the current network communication cost and or less than the value of the maximum cost value trigger parameter.

In an embodiment intelligently determining generating criteria may include the processing core generating a data volume based criterion. For example if the information received from the network components and or trigger parameters indicate that the amount of data that will be generated by the trigger and or the device profile are such that the immediate transmission of the trigger communication message is likely to cause or further contribute to network congestion the processing core may generate and set the criteria to include a network congestion level that is below the current level that will allow the network support the expected increase in data volume without impacting performance and or a time during which the network is expected to experience lower levels of network congestion e.g. 2 AM .

In an embodiment intelligently determining generating criteria may include the processing core generating a priority based criterion. For example the information received from the network components may indicate to the processing core that there are a hundred trigger communication messages waiting to be transmitted for a single subscriber and that the subscriber s account only has enough funds to transmit fifty of the waiting messages. In this case the processing core may generate and set the criteria to include a trigger priority level that is higher than fifty percent of the messages waiting to be transmitted so that the fifty messages with the highest priority are sent.

In an embodiment intelligently determining generating criteria may include the processing core generating a group based criterion. In this embodiment determining whether the criteria has been satisfied may include the processing core determining whether the subscriber belongs to a group and if so whether other trigger communication messages have been processed or transmitted for other devices components in that same group. The processing core may determine that the group based criterion has been met when it determines that other trigger communication messages have been processed or transmitted for other devices components that belong to the same group. In this embodiment the processing core may be configured to perform the same or similar operations for processing transmitting the received trigger communication message as those performed for the other devices components in the same group. As an example the processing core may receive a trigger for Device A in Group X and based on the current network state it decides to hold off sending a trigger for 2 hours. The processing core may cache that decision for all devices in Group X so that when a new trigger communication message is received for Device B in Group X it can automatically apply the same action without having to lookup the network state again.

In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to reschedule the currently scheduled triggers and or modify the criteria for transmitting the received triggers. For example if the MEE component scheduled 500 triggers to be sent between the hours of 00 00 and 05 00 at a rate of 100 per hour and receives an additional 1000 trigger communication message that require transmission between the hours of 00 00 and 02 00 the MEE component may reschedule currently scheduled triggers to be sent between the hours of 03 00 and 05 00.

In block the processing core may receive a trigger communication message from an M2M application server and generate and send a notification message to the server to acknowledge receipt of the trigger communication message. In optional block the processing core may perform identity management operations such as those discussed above with reference to . For example the processing core may replace a pseudonym identity value with a hardware based M2M device identity value replace an individual identity value e.g. a pseudonym identity a hardware based identity with a group identity value etc.

In optional block the processing core may request receive retrieve process apply and or analyze policy and charging information to generate information that is suitable for use in determining whether the trigger communication message should be blocked. The processing core may retrieve the policy and charging information from a memory of the network server or request and receive the information from components in the network such as the online charging system or the policy management system .

In determination block the processing core may use the received and or generated information to determine whether the trigger communication message should be sent to the destination M2M device . In an embodiment in determination block the processing core may also determine whether it has received a subsequent message to cancel or recall a scheduled trigger from the M2M application server and determine that the trigger communication message should not be sent to the destination M2M device when the processing core determines that a subsequent message to cancel or recall a scheduled trigger has been received.

When the processing core determines that the trigger communication message should not be sent to the destination M2M device i.e. determination block No in block the processing core may send an error response message to the M2M application server to notify it that the trigger was blocked.

When the processing core determines that the trigger communication message should be sent to the destination M2M device i.e. determination block Yes in optional block the processing core may perform various operations to schedule the trigger communication message for transmission. For example the processing core may perform the scheduling operations discussed above with reference to . In block the processing core may send the trigger communication message to a destination M2M device and notify the M2M application server that the trigger has been sent.

In block the processing core may charge the subscriber account associated with the M2M application server and or destination M2M device for the communication based on network conditions and or properties of the communication e.g. data volume etc. . This may be accomplished by the processing core sending charging details to either an online or offline charging system e.g. OCS OFCS component .

The MEE component may be configured to provide a combination of the functionalities typically provided in 3GPP network by a Services Capability Server SCS and a Machine Type Communications Interworking Function MTC IWF server and or functionally typically provided in an ETSI network by a Service Capability Layer SCL component. In addition the MEE component may communicate with other components in the network to perform advanced triggering operations.

In a 3GPP based network the SCS and MTC IWF combine to interact with the mobile network and provide machine to machine services to external third party application servers. The MTC IWF is a signaling only node whose main purpose is to trigger machine to machine devices on the network i.e. wake them up so that the application servers can send receive data to from them . The SCS handles signaling traffic trigger requests that it sends on to the MTC IWF as well as data plane data which is delivered to from the third party application server. For downlink data the SCS triggers the MTC IWF to wake up the device if there is not an active data session. Once the device is connected to the network the SCS would send data to the device over the Gi or SGi interface. For uplink data the device would connect to the network if not already connected and send data over the Gi or SGi interface.

In an ETSI based network M2M communications are facilitated via two interfaces mIa and mId. The mIa interface operates between the SCL component and the M2M application servers while the mId interface operates between the SCL component and the M2M device or a gateway that represents multiple machine to machine devices . The SCL component may present machine to machine functions that are shared between different applications. For example the SCL component may expose the machine to machine capabilities of the network to the third party application server and allow that application server obtain data from the machine to machine devices.

In the various embodiments the MEE component may be configured to perform the interface functionalities of a combination of the M2M components included in 3GPP and ETSI based networks. In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to implement the Diameter based Tsp interface protocol between the MTC IWF and the SCS process device trigger requests from the SCS and send confirmations to the SCS when the trigger request has been received by the MTC IWF and send the notification of a device trigger to the SCS.

In an embodiment the MEE component may allow the Diameter based Tsp interface to be externally facing. The SCS may be internal or external to the mobile operator s network therefore the Tsp interface may be externally facing and interact with third party application developers. The Tsp interface may be secure so as to prevent malicious external entities from connecting to the internal network. It may also protect against attacks such as denial of service attacks and ensure that it is not possible for external nodes to access data in the SCS.

In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to implement a non standard non Diameter Tsp like interface for use with external application developers. As the SCS may be external to a mobile operator s network and Diameter may not be well supported by application developers and it may be beneficial to offer a different interface with the same functionality as Tsp but aimed at the application developer community. This interface may perform the same functionality as Tsp and it may be based on the common principles of the protocols used in the application developer community easy to adopt lightweight based on commonly used protocols etc. .

In block the processing core may receive a trigger communication message request from a SCS component over the Tsp reference point. In block the processing core may request and receive information from a HSS or similar node to obtain the necessary information required for the trigger communication message e.g. IMSI serving node SCS permissions etc. . In block the processing core may generate and send a response message to the SCS component to indicate whether the device trigger request was accepted or blocked. In block the processing core may select an effective and efficient triggering delivery mechanism for delivering the trigger communication message to the destination device based on information obtained from the HSS component or based on local policies. For example in block the processing core may identify the control plane manager to which a destination M2M device is attached and or based on the M2M device s capabilities current serving node information received from the SCS component etc.

In optional block the processing core may generate and send a communication message to the SCS component to indicate whether a triggering delivery mechanism was successfully identified and or selected to deliver the trigger communication message to the destination M2M device . In block the processing core may apply congestion load control for responding to the trigger communication message. For example in block the processing core may perform the trigger scheduling operations discussed above with reference to .

In block the processing core may assign identifiers to the trigger request to allow the user equipment distinguish the message from other messages. For example in block the processing core may perform any of the identity management operations discussed above with reference to . In block the processing core may send the trigger communication message to the destination M2M device via the selected triggering delivery mechanism e.g. via the selected control plane manager .

In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to implement a policy based interface to a policy system such as the PCRF component and or PMS component . In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to implement a charging based interface to a charging system such as the OCS OFCS component or OCS component .

The policy based interface may allow policy decisions to be made regarding machine to machine data sessions including policy decisions that can be made before a data session has been established. This may be useful in scenarios where policy pre implementation is beneficial before a data session has been established based on a trigger being sent to the device. For example during triggering of a device the PCRF component can be informed as the trigger is being sent over the control plane interfaces. This may allow the PCRF component to pre determine a policy before the data session starts. The PCRF component may perform all necessary steps to determine the policy SPR lookup decision logic etc. in advance of the GGSN P GW getting the session or bearer establishment request.

The policy based interface may also allow resource validation to be accomplished before the trigger is sent. For example MEE component may be configured to determine whether the device has the correct policy necessary to allow the data session before transmitting the trigger. For example the MEE component may determine that there is no point in triggering the device if it is not allowed to access the network due to time of day controls being out of credit exceeding a number of connections etc. . The MEE component may be configured to communicate with the PCRF component and decide whether to allow or block the triggering request based on the resource validation information received from the PCRF component .

In an embodiment the policy based interface may be used to modify the trigger before it is sent to downstream nodes based on information received by the PCRF component . For example the PCRF component may determine that this is a low value customer device and therefore the trigger may be labeled as low priority for treatment in the MME SGSN SMS SC etc. Alternately if the PCRF component determines that this is a high priority trigger then it may be sent over multiple paths or labeled as prioritized using packet marking.

In an embodiment the policy based interface may allow for the pre reservation of bandwidth resources. For example the MEE component may be configured to receive a request for resources from the third party application server acting as an SCS and determine whether the request for resources actually requires that additional resources be allocated in the network based on the information received from the PCRF component . This interaction may be viewed as an Rx style interaction with the application server requesting the resources and the PCRF component allocating them in the PCEF PGW component e.g. setting up a dedicated bearer modifying an existing bearer etc. . In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to determine whether to block or send a trigger communication message originating from the third party application server to a destination device based on whether or not communicating the trigger communication messages will require that the network allocate additional resources. In an embodiment the MEE component may be configured to determine reserve or pre allocate resources based on the request for resources received from the third party application server.

In an embodiment the policy based interface may allow the MEE component acting as an SCS to query the PCRF component for policy information regarding policies currently installed for a device. This may also be applicable to a group of devices that share a common set of policies.

In an embodiment the policy based interface may enable the MEE component to send notifications and or information about a trigger to the PCRF component . This information can include AVPs including the device being triggered MSISDN or External Id AVP priority information Priority AVP the trigger payload Trigger Payload AVP and requested session information as received by the SCS from the Application Server e.g. information about desired session .

In an embodiment the policy based interface may enable the MEE component to request policy information from the PCRF component . This may include triggering specific policies such as is a trigger allowed at this time. It may also include a request for the amount of data triggers allowed per month and whether the device is close to that limit. Aside from triggering the request may be for information around bandwidth QCI APR or other QoS related parameters. The information in the request may include the device being triggered MSISDN or External Id AVP the information requested triggering policy allowed blocked signaling information num connections allowed per month and current total if available QoS information including whether the QoS should be reserved or not data usage information if available in the PCRF device group based information such as the group the device is in and time related information e.g. for the cases where different policies apply at different times i.e. the times for the requested policies .

As mentioned above the MEE component may be configured to provide or include a charging based interface to a charging system such as the OCS OFCS component and the OCS component . This charging interface may allow the following functionality M2M specific charging e.g. charging per connection charging differently at different times combined charging for groups of devices obtaining balance information e.g. to display to the application servers to send a notification to an application server to alter the behavior on the network based on a balance rating plan etc. and modifying the balance or rating information e.g. increase decrease a balance modify a rating plan etc. .

In a further embodiment the MEE component may be configured to trigger a device or group of devices before transmitting information so that the device connects to the network and the data may be transmitted to the downstream node over the Gi or SGi interfaces.

In an embodiment the third party application server interface may enable a third party application server e.g. M2M application servers to retrieve data from a device e.g. M2M device or group of devices. This enables the third party application servers to initiate a pull request for data from a device or group of devices.
