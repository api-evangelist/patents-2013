It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Additionally the alerting hub may receive responses from the alert receiving equipment and distribute the responses to the originator of the alert corresponding to the response. The alerting hub may normalize the alert responses and format the alert responses corresponding to format requirements of the alert originator .

Furthermore the information exchange may connect to a plurality of all hazards alert networks. The all hazards alert networks may be independently controlled and may include all hazards alert networks controlled by different local governments all hazards alert networks controlled by different state governments all hazards alert networks controlled by different federal entities and all hazards alert networks controlled by hospitals airports universities and businesses.

Also the information exchange may connect to a plurality of entities other than alert networks. The entities may include different local governments all hazards alert networks controlled by different state governments all hazards alert networks controlled by different federal entities and all hazards alert networks controlled by hospitals airports universities and businesses.

Optionally the national information exchange determines one or more affected regions of the received all hazards information and distributes the all hazards information affecting a first region dotted lines into a corresponding first regional information exchange and distribute the all hazards information affecting a second region dashed lines into a corresponding second regional information exchange . Additionally the national information exchange may distribute all hazards information affecting additional regions into corresponding additional regional information exchanges .

As illustrated in the national information exchange receives from the first regional information exchange all hazards information affecting the second region dashed lines and distributes to the corresponding second regional information exchange . Likewise the national information exchange receives from the second regional information exchange all hazards information affecting the first region dotted lines and distributes to the corresponding first regional information exchange .

Preferably the national information exchange gathers all hazards information from the national information sources . The regional information exchanges gathers all hazards information from the regional information sources . The national information exchange distributes all hazards information to the regional information exchanges . The first regional information exchange distributes all hazards information from the national information exchange and from the first regional information sources to the first all hazards alert networks . Likewise the second regional information exchange distributes all hazards information from the national information exchange and from the second regional information sources to the second all hazards alert networks . Also the national information exchange distributes directly to the plurality of all hazards alert networks corresponding to the first region and the plurality of all hazards alert networks corresponding to the second region .

The regional information exchanges may of course correspond to a geographic region. In an alternate embodiment the regional information exchanges may also correspond to domain based regions. Domain based regional information exchanges may generally relate to specialized subjects of interest to users of the domain based regional information exchanges. The domain based regional information exchanges may include information exchanges directed towards warning ordinary citizens information exchanges directed towards warning first responders information exchanges directed towards local state or federal agencies having specialized subjects of interest. Of course geographic and domain based regional information exchanges could be considered together in the information distribution system .

Additionally one or more of the all hazards alert networks may also be regional information sources. Accordingly a first regional information exchange may gather all hazards information from an all hazards alert network that is also a regional information source and distribute to the one or more of the all hazards alert networks corresponding to the first region or to one or more of the all hazards alert networks corresponding to the second region. Also the first regional information exchange may distribute directly to the all hazards networks corresponding the second region.

The receiving and distributing of all hazards information may occur in real time including that no action is required of a person between the receiving and distributing of the all hazards information. The receiving and distributing of all hazards information may be moderated including that a decision of a person moderator occurs between the receiving and distributing of all hazards information. Moderators may monitor incoming traffic modify messages forward messages and reject messages. Moderators may be alerted when new messages are received. The information exchanges may include both real time and moderated gathering and distribution of all hazards information.

All hazards information generally relates to time sensitive information relating to personal or communal safety or convenience and may include weather information traffic information seismic information flood information epidemic information crime information fire information government announcements school closings tax notices sporting events cancellations terrorist information biohazards information and natural disasters information. All hazards information sources may include publicly available all hazards information sources and non publicly available all hazards information sources.

The push handlers may receive all hazards information in a plurality of different formats from a plurality of information sources and the poller daemon may receive all hazards information in a plurality of different formats from a plurality of information sources . The poller daemons may poll the one or more information sources at a predefined frequency. Polling methods include polling via HTTP GET and via HTTP POST. Furthermore other types of receiving handlers may be added as plug in modules to the information exchange and any data source may be accessed.

Feed parsers include Really Simple Syndication RSS Common Alerting Protocol CAP plain text messages NIEM general purpose custom XML and other formats as may be preferred from the circumstances.

The controllers may employ data mining and trend analysis in the analysis across multiple entries of the stored all hazards information such as determining the size of a fire based on the number of smoke detectors reporting the fire or the number of 911 calls received or such as detecting preparation for a coordinated terrorist attack based on multiple reports on suspicious activities on bridges.

Furthermore the information exchange of may include one or more subscription managers connected to the message dispatchers and one or more subscription management API connected to the one or more subscription managers. The subscription managers maintain subscription parameters for information receivers and communicate the subscription parameters to the message dispatchers . The subscription parameters may include a content requirement of a subscriber or group of subscribers in order for an all hazards message to be distributed to them. The subscription management API accepts subscription parameters from information receivers and communicates the subscription parameters to the subscription managers . The receiving handlers receive all hazards information. The controllers analyze the received all hazards information and initiate an all hazards message from the analyzed all hazards information. The message dispatchers identify information receivers subscribed to receive the initiated all hazards message according to the subscription parameters. The distributing handlers distribute the initiated all hazards message to the identified information receivers.

The subscription API may include a web interface or web service for adding or modifying subscriptions.

Furthermore the response handlers may identify an all hazards message corresponding to the response. The response handlers identify the information source or provider of the information source corresponding to the all hazards message. The response handlers route the response to the information source or provider of the information source corresponding to the all hazards message. Also the response handlers may identify the source of the response and the location of the responder and report the source and location to the information source or provider of the information source corresponding to the all hazards message. The response may confirm the original message and provide additional relevant information to the information source or provider of the information source corresponding to the all hazards message. Additionally the response may be added to the database for further analysis and may result in initiated all hazards messages.

The information exchange includes one or more information source managers connected to the poller daemons and one or more information source application programming interfaces API connected to the information source managers. The information source managers maintain polling parameters specific to each information source and the information source API may accept polling parameters from providers of the information sources and communicate the polling parameters to the information source managers. The information source managers may communicate the polling parameters to the poller daemons and store the polling parameters in a database.

Also the information source managers may report status of information received from information sources. For example the information source managers report to the information sources or providers of the information sources whether and when information received from the information sources were distributed. The information source managers report who received the distributed information to the information sources or providers of the information sources. The information source managers may access the status by communicating with a database storing the status.

Additionally the information source managers may maintain privacy preferences of the information sources. For example the information source managers maintain whether a particular information source is publishable authorized only or approved only. The privacy preferences may be stored in a database .

The information exchange includes one or more content extractors connected to the push handlers and to the poller daemons. The content extractors receive all hazards information from the push handlers and the poller daemons and extract a payload of all hazards content from the all hazards information.

The information exchange includes one or more feed parsers connected to the content extractors. The feed parsers parse the payload of all hazards content into pieces of all hazards content.

The information exchange includes one or more content enhancers connected to the feed parsers. The content enhancers enhance the content of the pieces of all hazards information.

Furthermore the information exchange includes processing units for normalizing the all hazards information. The normalizing function may be a separate processing unit or may be a function of another element of the information exchange. For example the feed parsers may normalize the all hazards information.

Furthermore the information exchange may eliminate duplication of all hazards information. The information exchange may identify and eliminate substantially exact duplicates of all hazards information. The information exchange may identify closely related all hazards information and eliminate closely related all hazards information or the information exchange may identify closely related all hazards information and combine the closely related all hazards information.

The information exchange includes one or more controllers connected to the content enhancers and one or more databases connected to the controllers. The controllers analyze the pieces of all hazards information and initiate all hazards messages from the analyzed all hazards information. The databases enter the pieces of all hazards information into storage. Furthermore the controllers may analyze across multiple entries of the stored all hazards information and initiate all hazards messages from the multiple entries of all hazards information.

The information exchange includes one or more message dispatchers connected to the controllers and one or more distributing handlers connected to the message dispatchers. The message dispatchers identify information receivers subscribed to receive the initiated all hazards messages. The message dispatchers receive filtering parameters of information receivers. For example the filtering parameters may include that the information receiver only receives messages at desired times or only with desired keywords. The distributing handlers distribute the initiated all hazards messages to the identified information receivers.

The information exchange includes one or more subscription managers connected to the message dispatchers and one or more subscription management API connected to the one or more subscription managers. The subscription managers maintain subscription parameters for information receivers and communicate the subscription parameters to the message dispatchers. The subscription management API accepts subscription parameters from information receivers and communicates the subscription parameters to the subscription managers. The subscription parameters may include whether particular information receivers are subscribed to receive a particular all hazards message. Also the subscription parameters may include filtering parameters. The subscription managers may store the subscription parameters in databases .

Also the information exchange may identify status of information received from information sources. For example the controllers or message dispatchers may identify whether and when information received from particular information sources was distributed. The subscription managers may identify who received the information from the particular information sources. The status of the information received from information sources may be stored in a database which may then be accessed by information source managers.

Additionally the subscription managers may identify privacy preferences of the information sources. The privacy preferences may be accessed from a database. For example the subscription managers may identify whether particular information sources are publishable authorized only or approved only. Further the subscription managers may identify whether the particular subscribers are approved for the particular information sources.

The information exchange includes one or more response handlers and one or more response dispatchers connected to the one or more response handlers. The response handlers receive responses to the distributed all hazards messages identify the all hazards message that corresponds to the response and identify the information source or provider that corresponds to the all hazards message. The response handler may communicate with the subscription manager to identify the information source or provider that corresponds to the all hazards message and the response dispatcher may deliver the responses to the corresponding information source provider.

The information exchange may include an admin GUI. The admin GUI may be a web based interface for changing setup parameters of the controller for approving information sources and for modifying filters. Another method for changing setup parameters of the controller for approving information sources and for modifying filters is through a GUI of the information receiver that then communicates with the subscription API of the information exchange.

The information exchange may include a response API for communicating responses from outside the information exchange to the information sources or information source providers.
