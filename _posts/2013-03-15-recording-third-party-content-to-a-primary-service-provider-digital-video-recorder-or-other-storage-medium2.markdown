With the advent of video distribution systems it has become possible to deliver video content over Internet protocol IP to a variety of devices such as IP set top boxes and associated television systems mobile devices telephones tablet computers laptop computers etc. smart televisions and the like. In a typical setting a content service provider such as a cable television provider or other television content service provider may provide such content for consumption by a customer subscriber including allowing the customer subscriber to record content to one or more storage systems for future playback.

Oftentimes third party service providers allow customers subscribers of a primary service provider to access third party content via the systems of the primary service provider. For example a cable television service provider may allow its customers subscribers to access and consume content from a third party news service sports entertainment service or video service through the systems of the cable television service provider by providing the customer subscriber links to the content of the third party service provider such that selection of the links allows the customer subscriber to access the third party content from the primary service provider systems. A significant drawback to such third party content access however is an inability of the customer subscriber to record the third party content for future playback.

Embodiments of the present invention solve the above and other problems by providing recording of third party content on recording systems of a primary service provider through which a customer subscriber accesses third party content.

According to embodiments third party service providers may provide information about video content to a primary content service provider. The information may include metadata that identifies and describes various features and attributes of the content and that provides links to the content of the third party service provider. The primary service provider may allow its customers subscribers to access the third party content through the systems of the primary service provider. Upon navigation to a desired third party content item a customer subscriber may request a recording of the third party content. The third party content may be passed to the primary service provider for recording on one or more storage systems associated with the primary service provider and the recorded content may subsequently be played back by the customer subscriber in the same manner as play back of content recorded from the primary service provider.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description set out below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detail description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

As briefly described above embodiments of the present invention are directed to recording third party content on recording systems of a primary service provider through which a customer subscriber accesses third party content. Third party service providers for example news services sports entertainment services website operators or any other third party video content provider may provide information about video content to a primary content service provider for example a cable television service provider. The information may include metadata that identifies and describes various features and attributes of the content and that provides links to the content of the third party service provider. The primary service provider may populate a programming guide with information about its programming and it may use the content information received from third parties to populate the programming guide with information about available third party content. Upon selection of a third party content item from the programming guide the customer subscriber may navigate to the third party content for consuming the desired content.

According to embodiments the customer subscriber may select a recording function associated with the third party content and the third party content may be passed to the primary service provider for recording on one or more storage systems associated with the primary service provider. The recorded content may then be listed along with other recorded content and the recorded content may be played back to the customer subscriber at a future date time in the same manner as the customer subscriber would do if the content had been provided by the primary service provider.

Receiving devices include any device capable of receiving audio and video content and for allowing consumption of the content. For example a television and associated set top box is illustrated a tablet computing device is illustrated a mobile telephone is illustrated a smart television is illustrated and other IP capable devices are illustrated.

The primary service provider may extract information from the central content metadata collection point for identifying and describing available content and for populating information about available content in a programming guide .

The actual content for example video content may be passed to customers subscribers of the primary service provider via one or more third party content delivery networks CDN . Thus information including metadata associated with individual content items may be stored and analyzed via the central content metadata collection point and may be mated with the desired content which may be passed from the third party CDN to the primary service provider CDN for ultimate distribution to the customers subscribers of the service provider . In addition as illustrated in the primary service provider may access the third party CDN directly for content and data as authorized by an operating relationship between the primary service provider and one or more third party content and data providers.

According to an embodiment when metadata is received in association with a given content item from one or more third party content providers the back end application server may be operative to analyze the data received and stored at the central content metadata collection point for use in association with the systems of the primary service provider and for enhancement as desired by the primary service provider . For example information identifying one or more content items provided by the third party content providers may be used by the primary service provider for correlating the third party data with data maintained by the primary service provider for its content. For example correlating data received from third party service providers with data maintained by the primary service provider may allow the primary service provider to determine whether a given piece of third party content is already available from the primary service provider. That is if a customer subscriber of the primary service provider desires to view a particular television show provided by a third party video provider analysis of metadata associated with the content item may allow the primary service provider to know that the same or matching content item is available from the primary service provider such that the primary service provider may provide the content item to its customer subscriber without the need for streaming the content item from the third party content provider.

In addition metadata associated with third party content items may be used in association with information from the primary service provider for enhancing content offerings. For example metadata associated with a third party content item that will be used for populating a programming guide may be supplemented with information from the primary service provider such as viewing times ratings applied to the content item and the like.

A content viewing tile is illustrated for providing content in association with a given viewing channel.

As described above with reference to the information populating the content channel rows illustrated may be obtained from the various third party service providers and may be assembled and analyzed at the central content metadata collection point . In addition to displaying information provided by the third party service providers the primary service provider may add additional information such as viewing times ratings descriptive information and the like. Once information is obtained and analyzed for each third party offering appropriate descriptive information may be generated for populating in the programming guide.

Beneath the display of content item offerings are illustrated a variety of functionality buttons controls text boxes and the like. For example a record button is illustrated for allowing a user to selectively record a content item that is presently running or to allow the user to selectively record a content item that is scheduled to run at a future time. The other services button is illustrative of a functionality control associated with other functionalities and services a customer subscriber may select in association with various content items. The advertisement banner is illustrative of a text box or other zone within the programming guide for providing useful helpful or other interesting information to customers subscribers. As should be appreciated the layout content information and functionalities illustrated in the example programming guide are for purposes of example only and are not restrictive of the vast numbers of content items and layouts that may be utilized for the user interface with which a customer subscriber may interact with and receive information from a service provider .

Having described an exemplary operating environment and an example programming guide with reference to is a flowchart illustrating a method for accessing and recording third party content via a primary service provider. The method begins at start operation and proceeds to operation where the back end application server of the primary service provider launches an application to provide content for viewing recording or other consumption in response to a customer subscriber request. For example launching an application to provide content may be the result of the selection of a particular content channel provided in the programming guide illustrated in or launching an application to provide content may be the result of the selection of a channel designation number for example channel 8 via a television remote control keyboard touch display or other device for allowing the user to interact with the service offerings of the service provider .

At operation a client application associated with the user s content viewing device may launch a media player for allowing the selected content item to be streamed to the customer subscriber s content viewing device and at operation the selected content is provided. For example the user may desire to watch a favorite television show and in response to selecting the desired television show from the programming guide a client application on the user s set top box may launch a media player and may request the content to be streamed to the customer subscriber through the set top box from a content repository for example a cable television service s head end associated with the service provider back end application server . As should be appreciated at this point the customer subscriber may utilize the provided content in any manner provided for by the customer subscriber s contractual relationship with the primary service provider. For example the customer subscriber may record the provided content at any of the acceptable recording locations for example his her DVR device at a cloud based storage medium provided by the primary service provider or on another storage device for example a storage device contained in association with or physically integrated with the customer subscriber s receiving viewing device .

At operation a selection of a third party content item is received from a customer subscriber via the programming guide for requesting provision of a desired third party content item available to the customer subscriber from a third party content provider as described above with reference to . For example consider that a user is navigating a programming guide illustrated in and recognizes that a website in operation by a popular news service is available and includes video about a current news item that is of interest to the customer subscriber. In response to a selection of the content channel provided in the programming guide associated with the desired website the customer subscriber may selectively request that the video provided through the website be streamed from the third party service provider to the customer subscriber via the primary service provider as described above as referenced to .

At operation authorizations permissions and or authentications associated with the customer subscriber may be retrieved for the customer subscriber to verify that the customer subscriber may in fact request and receive the desired third party content. For example a customer subscriber profile database may be maintained in the service provider back end as illustrated in and as described further below with respect to for maintaining information on each customer subscriber. For example for each customer subscriber of the primary service provider identification information billing information and other personally identifying information for properly establishing the customer subscriber as a valid customer subscriber of the servicer provider may be maintained.

In addition information identifying and describing each service offering available to a given customer subscriber may be maintained. For example one customer subscriber may have a contractual relationship with the service provider that provides only a very basic set of content offerings for example a basic channel package that does not include content provision from third party service providers. Another customer subscriber may have a contractual relationship with the primary service provider that provides a more enhanced content viewing package providing basic content offering channels plus access to one or more third party service providers for example third party news services third party sports services third party business information services and the like. Thus at operation when a customer subscriber requests access to content from a given third party service provider the profile information for the customer subscriber may be parsed and a determination may be made as to whether the requesting customer subscriber is authorized to access and receive the requested third party content. As should be appreciated in addition to checking a customer subscriber profile database an authentication user interface may be provided to request such authentication information as username and password if such authentication is required by the primary service provider or by the third party service provider from which the content is desired. Such authentication may be required for example for overriding a parental control that may have been placed in association with the desired third party content item.

At operation the service provider back end application server may query the central content metadata collection point for any additional information or metadata associated with the requested third party content and the retrieved information may be used to correlate the retrieved information with other information maintained by the primary service provider for determining how to obtain the desired third party content item and whether the third party content item may be available from the primary service provider without the need for obtaining the desired content item from the third party service provider. For example at operation if the user has requested as a third party content item a vintage television show the user desires to record at a future date for a future viewing metadata associated with the requested vintage television show may be retrieved and an analysis may be performed to determine whether the requested vintage television show may be offered by the primary service provider at a time between the present time and the desired recording time such that the desired content item may be recorded from the primary service provider program offerings without the need for retrieving and recording the desired content item from the third party service provider. In addition at operation obtained metadata and other information for the desired content item may be utilized for displaying additional information in the programming guide for example additional information that may be of interest to the customer subscriber with respect to viewing and or recording the desired content such as the next available viewing time the length of the content item and the like.

At operation a request is received at the service provider back end application server for recording the selected third party content. As should be appreciated the request for recording the selected content may come from selection of a record function as illustrated above with respect to or may come from selection of a record function when the third party content begins to play or a record function may be selected for a third party content item to commence at a future date time when the third party content item will be played. At operation the back end application server may provide via the programming guide a listing of recording options including a list of storage locations for example the DVR the cloud based storage medium or other storage locations devices as described above. In addition the storage options provided at operation may include options to record the content item during play or at a future time when the third party content item will be available. At operation a request to record the desired third party content item to a selected storage location is received at the primary service provider back end application server in response to a selection by the customer subscriber.

At operation a determination is made as to whether the desired third party content item is available from the primary service provider in addition to its availability from the third party service provider. As described above if a review of the information obtained for the requested third party content item indicates that the requested content item is available from the customer subscriber s primary service provider then the requested content item may be recorded directly from the primary service provider without the need for obtaining the third party content item from a third party service provider. As should be appreciated recording the content item from the primary service provider may be more efficient and less costly because use of resources associated with obtaining the content item from the third party content provider may be avoided. If the requested content item is available from the primary service provider the method proceeds to operation and the desired content item is recorded from the primary service provider to the designated storage location as described below with reference to .

Referring back to operation if the content desired by the customer subscriber is not available from the primary service provider the method proceeds to operation and a determination is made as to whether the customer subscriber is authorized to record the desired third party content item. As should be appreciated while the customer subscriber may be authorized via his her contractual relationship with the primary service provider and via its relationship with the third party service providers to obtain and view a given third party content item the customer subscriber may not be authorized to record the desired third party content item. As described above the determination of whether the customer subscriber is authorized to record the desired content item is determined by reviewing profile information for the customer subscriber to determine whether the contractual relationship between the customer subscriber and the primary service provider allows for recording the desired third party content item. If the customer subscriber is not authorized to record the desired third party content item the method proceeds to operation and the customer subscriber is notified that he she may not record the desired content item.

If the customer subscriber is authorized to record the desired third party content item the method proceeds to operation and the third party content item is either passed from the third party CDN to the primary service provider CDN from which it is recorded to the desired storage location or the third party content item is recorded from the third party CDN to the desired storage location. As should be appreciated the access of the third party content item may be made by any acceptable means for accessing IP based content for example by locating the content at a specific IP based address via a uniform resource locator URL provided by the third party content provider for the accessed content item. Likewise transport or streaming of the requested third party content item to the primary service provider CDN and ultimately to the designated storage location is done according to well known methods for streaming video content between to IP based devices and or storage systems. The method ends at operation .

Having described a process flow for accessing and recording third party content with reference to is a flowchart illustrating a method for recording third party content to one or more storage systems of a primary service provider. The method begins at start operation and proceeds to operation where a command is received at the primary service provider back end application server to record the desired third party content to a designated storage location for example the DVR the cloud based storage system or another storage device .

At operation a determination is made as to whether the desired third party content is available from the primary service provider as described above with reference to operation of . If the desired third party content item is not available from the primary service provider the method proceeds to operation and the desired third party content item is streamed from the third party CDN to the primary service provider CDN as illustrated and described above with respect to . Whether the desired content comes from the primary service provider or from the third party service provider the method proceeds to operation and a determination is made as to where and how the third party content item is to be recorded.

The decision as to where the content should be recorded may be based on a decision by the customer subscriber who is given options to select a storage location for the content. Alternatively the customer subscriber may have a profile preference set for recording content that designates the storage locations for example all recorded content will be stored at a cloud based server. Alternatively the DVR manager or another suitable application e.g. at the back end application server may monitor storage capacity at available storage locations and the determination as to where to store a given content item may be based on capacity at the various locations.

At operation a determination is made as to whether the requested content item is to be recorded to the digital video recording system . If yes the method proceeds to operation and the DVR manager is instructed by the back end application server to cause the content item to be streamed from the primary service provider CDN to the DVR via the DVR manager for storage as requested by the customer subscriber. That is the DVR manager may manage when the content is recorded to the DVR and whether any additional metadata should be associated with the recording as provided by the service provider or as requested by the customer subscriber.

Returning to operation if the determination is made that the requested third party content item is not to be recorded on the customer subscriber s DVR system the method proceeds to operation and a determination is made as to whether the requested content item is to be recorded to the cloud based storage location . If yes the method may proceed along one of two branches depending on where the third party content item is to be streamed from for recording. At operation the desired third party content item may be recorded from the primary service provider CDN to the cloud based storage location . Alternatively if the appropriate contractual relationship exists between the primary service provider and the third party service provider associated with the desired third party content item then the desired content item may be recorded directly from the third party CDN to the cloud based storage location at operation .

Referring back to operation if a determination is made that the third party content item is not to be recorded to the cloud based storage location and that the item is to be recorded to some other designated storage location or device for example at a storage location located on the customer subscriber s receiving and viewing device for example the customer subscriber s tablet computing device the operation proceeds to either operation where the third party content item may be recorded from the primary service provider CDN to the designated storage device location or the method may proceed to operation where the content item may be recorded directly from the third party CDN to the designated other storage device location. According to an alternative embodiment instead of recording the desired third party content item to a storage location associated with the primary service provider as illustrated in the third party content item may be streamed to and recorded at a storage location device system associated with the third party service provider from which the content item is retrieved.

According to an embodiment after a content item from a third party service provider is recorded as described above information identifying the recorded content item may be provided in a list of recorded content items accessible by the customer subscriber and the recorded content item may be selected from the list for viewing as desired by the customer subscriber in the same manner the customer subscriber would view recorded items recorded directly from his her primary service provider . Thus in accordance with embodiments of the present invention the customer subscriber is able to obtain for viewing and recording content items made available from a variety of third party content providers in addition to those content items provided via his her primary service provider. The method ends at operation .
