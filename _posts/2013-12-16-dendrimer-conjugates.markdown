The present invention relates to novel therapeutic and diagnostic dendrimers. In particular the present invention is directed to dendrimer linker conjugates methods of synthesizing the same compositions comprising the conjugates as well as systems and methods utilizing the conjugates e.g. in diagnostic and or therapeutic settings e.g. for the delivery of therapeutics imaging and or targeting agents e.g. in disease e.g. cancer diagnosis and or therapy pain therapy etc. .

Cancer remains the number two cause of mortality in the United States resulting in over 500 000 deaths per year. Despite advances in detection and treatment cancer mortality remains high. New compositions and methods for the imaging and treatment e.g. therapeutic of cancer may help to reduce the rate of mortality associated with cancer.

Severe chronic pain is observed a variety of subjects. For example there exist large numbers of individuals with sever pain associated with arthritis autoimmune disease injury cancer and a host of other conditions.

A vast number of different types of pain medications exist. For example a number natural and synthetic alkaloids of opium i.e. opioids are useful as analgesics for the treatment of severe pain. However a number of severe side effects associated with opioid and other pain medication usage exist. For example administration of opioid agonists often results in intestinal dysfunction due to action of the opioid agonist upon the large number of receptors in the intestinal wall. Opioids are generally known to cause nausea and vomiting as well as inhibition of normal propulsive gastrointestinal function in animals resulting in side effects such as constipation.

Pain medication e.g. opioid induced side effects are a serious problem for patients being administered pain medications e.g. opioid analgesics for both short term and long term pain management. For instance more than 250 000 terminal cancer patients each year take opioids such as morphine for pain relief and about half of those patients experience severe constipation. At present patients receiving opioid pain medications face the difficult choice of suffering burdensome adverse effects e.g. constipation or ineffective analgesia.

There exists a need for compositions methods and systems for delivering agents e.g. diagnostic and or therapeutic e.g. cancer and or pain therapeutics to subjects that provide effective therapy e.g. disease treatment symptom relief etc. with reduced or eliminated side effects even when administered in high doses.

Battlefield trauma covers a range of injuries caused by different mechanisms resulting at times in severe disturbances of vital functions disability fear and pain see e.g. Conventional warfare ballistic blast and burn injuries. 1990 Department of the Army Office of the Surgeon General Borden Institute. 396 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Depending on the military situation initial reliance for first aid must either be administered by oneself other troops or field medics. It is not until the injured reach a Forward Surgical Team FST or a Battalion Aid Station BAS that trained personnel can administer traditional pain and anxiolytic medications due to the need for frequent assessment of the medications side effects and need for supportive measures to prevent drug induced deterioration of vital functions see e.g. Anesthesia and perioperative care of the combat casualty. 1995 Department of the Army Office of the Surgeon General Borden Institute. 931 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Unfortunately the time for an injured soldier to arrive at a FST or BAS unit can be delayed for hours to days. Adequate pain therapy may be markedly delayed resulting in problems such as long term psychological psychiatric effects chronic pain syndromes and Post Traumatic Stress Disorders. This prolonged exposure of service members to inadequately treated pain is associated with considerable cost to the soldier and society see e.g. Bloodworth D. Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am 2006. 17 2 p. 355 79 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

If one were to attempt to administer potent pain and anxiolytic amnestic medications to injured soldiers on the battlefield it is important to understand the compensatory physiological responses required to preserve vital functions during trauma and evaluate how these medications side effects could potentiate combat induced pathophysiology. Ventilation with oxygenation and perfusion of vital organs the heart lungs and brain must be preserved in the face of major injuries and blood loss while at the same time perfusion of other organ systems may virtually shut down. Such a reduced flow state may be maintained for hours or days depending on the soldier s condition environment and other factors. Disturbance of this delicate cardio respiratory balance by pain medications needs to be considered carefully lest it be detrimental or even fatal to the injured. Reports of blood gasses of injured personnel taken at the time of admission to the FST unit illustrate the degree of cardio respiratory and metabolic compromise that occur in non fatal injuries. Approximately 35 of injured entrants had pH levels in the range of 7.0 to 7.20 and as low as 6.9 while pCO2 levels were often in the 50 60 mmHg range and could be as high as 80 90 mmHg in severe trauma. Oxygen saturation levels were as low as 40 while the lowest hematocrit encountered was 9 mg dl. This shows the dire nature of combat injuries and provides an insight into why the administration of analgesic and anxiolytic amnestic medications with vasodilatory and respiratory depressive side effects has been avoided. It also suggests the need for physiologically triggered feedback regulation to prevent worsening of these derangements.

The unique conditions of battlefield trauma require a complex pain relief solution. For example there is a need for a form of sustained therapeutic that could relieve pain over many hours or even days. This situation is further complicated by the need for battlefield therapeutics to be easily administered preferably without the technical challenge of intravenous access or continuous administration. Therapy should not require monitoring since uninjured soldiers will be involved in ongoing combat. Some effective pain medications e.g. narcotic analgesics have serious limitations. For example narcotic analgesics are short acting the therapeutic index is relatively narrow and the doses of drug that cause analgesia are not greatly separated from those that cause serious side effects including respiratory depression and hypotension due to vasodilatation see e.g. Bloodworth D. Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am 2006. 17 2 p. 355 79 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Such side effects can actually worsen the physiological derangements of acute trauma. Respiratory depression leads to respiratory acidosis that can cause metabolic derangements. This can also exacerbate metabolic acidosis due to traumatic injury and sustained depression can lead to death from hypoxia due to respiratory failure. Hypotension can trigger shock and cardiovascular collapse especially in an individual who has already suffered traumatic blood loss. Thus to provide autonomously effective narcotic analgesia over long periods of time in the battlefield a need exists for a sustained release narcotic with a widened therapeutic index allowing for sustained analgesia in the absence of respiratory depression. This formulation should also be easily administered e.g. through intramuscular auto injector . Finally lack of sedation and an absence of systemic side effects are acutely important given the fact that individuals with traumatic injuries in the battlefield may need to participate in self extraction to safety.

The present invention provides compositions and related methods addressing such needs. In particular the present invention provides compositions comprising dendrimer molecules e.g. polyamideamine PAMAM dendrimers polypropylamine POPAM dendrimers or PAMAM POPAM dendrimers conjuguated to one or more pain relief agents e.g. prodrug analgesic molecules prodrug anxiolytic drugs prodrug amnestic drugs . In some embodiments the dendrimers conjugated to one or more pain relief agents are configured for controlled and or sustained release of the pain relief agents e.g. through use of targeting agents linking agents and or trigger agents conjugated to the dendrimer and or pain relief agent . In some embodiments the pain relief agent conjugated to the dendrimer is active upon administration to a subject. In some embodiments sustained release e.g. slow release over a period of 24 48 hours of the pain relief drug is accomplished through conjugating the pain relief drug to the dendrimer through for example a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that slowly degrades in a biological system e.g. ester linkage . In some embodiments constitutively active release of the pain relief drug is accomplished through conjugating the pain relief drug to the dendrimer through for example a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that renders the pain relief agent constitutively active in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ether linkage . In some embodiments sustained release e.g. a slow release mechanism that achieves analgesic concentrations over a period of for example 24 48 hours of the pain relief agent prevents adverse side effects of the pain relief agent e.g. respiratory failure adverse cardiovascular consequences .

In certain embodiments the compositions comprising dendrimer molecules conjugated to one or more pain relief agents are co administered with additional agents designed to prevent adverse side effects of pain relief agents e.g. respiratory failure adverse cardiovascular consequences . In some embodiments the compositions comprising dendrimer molecules conjuguated to one or more pain relief agents e.g. narcotic prodrugs are co administered with a pain relief agent antagonist e.g. a narcotic antagonist that is modulated to permit analgesia while preventing respiratory depression . In some embodiments a feedback system is employed so as to prevent respiratory failure and adverse cardiovascular consequences while still maintaining analgesia. In some embodiments the feedback component is a rapid acting narcotic antagonist e.g. Naloxone released only upon detection of symptoms of respiratory depression. In some embodiments the biomarker used to monitor respiratory depression and trigger the release of the antagonist is hypoxia low pO2 . Hypoxia is a sensitive and important marker as it is the direct cause of tissue injury from respiratory failure. It is also more specific than lowered serum pH a marker of respiratory acidosis since this is also observed in acute trauma situations as a result of metabolic derangements. A fast acting antagonist released in response to hypoxia rapidly reverses respiratory depression which thereby increases the pO2 reversing the hypoxia and stopping the release of the antagonist. In contrast the narcotic itself would continue to be released at a slow and predictable rate. In this way appropriate analgesia is achieved that is reversed only when absolutely necessary to prevent respiratory failure. This would allow maintenance of analgesia in the battlefield for prolonged periods of time without monitoring of the wounded. In some embodiments as shown in the present invention provides compositions comprising a plurality of pain relief agents coupled to dendrimers with a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that slowly degrades in a biological system e.g. ester linkage as shown in the trigger agent is an ester bond that is released by serum esterases to mediate sustained release analgesia . When administered together the plurality of pain relief agents e.g. Ketamine and Lorazepam have favorable analgesic and anxiolytic amnestic qualities and relatively broad therapeutic indexes. Compositions comprising a plurality of pain relief agents e.g. Ketamine and Lorazepam provide analgesia without the cardiovascular effects of opioids and minimize their major complication that being respiratory depression. As a feedback mechanism compositions of the invention comprising a pain relief agent antagonist e.g. Doxapram are complexed with a dendrimer through charge interaction e.g. that is releasable by for example acidosis . While acidosis may be observed from causes other than respiratory depression this feedback mechanism is unique in that Doxapram stimulates respirations without reducing analgesia. As such the present invention provides release of Doxapram regardless of the source of the acidosis e.g. traumatic injuries hemorrhagic shock burns or rhabdomyolysis . Thus the present invention provides a safe analgesia with easily achieved physiological feedback.

In some embodiments targeting agents are conjugated to the dendrimers for delivery of the dendrimers to desired body regions e.g. to the central nervous system CNS . The targeting agents are not limited to targeting specific body regions. In some embodiments the targeting agents target the central nervous system CNS . In some embodiments targeting agents target the peripheral nervous system specific nerves e.g. perception nerves pain nerves pressure nerves etc. muscles and or tendons. In some embodiments where the targeting agent is specific for the CNS the targeting agent is transferrin see e.g. Daniels T. R. et al. Clinical Immunology 2006. 121 2 p. 159 176 Daniels T. R. et al. Clinical Immunology 2006. 121 2 p. 144 158 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . In some embodiments the targeting agents target neurons within the central nervous system CNS . In some embodiments where the targeting agent is specific for neurons within the CNS the targeting agent is a synthetic tetanus toxin fragment e.g. a 12 amino acid peptide Tet 1 see e.g. Liu J. K. et al. Neurobiology of Disease 2005. 19 3 p. 407 418 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In some embodiments locking agents designed to retain the dendrimer within a particular body region are conjugated to the dendrimer e.g. locking agents designed to prevent back diffusion of a dendrimer across the blood brain barrier BBB e.g. pyridinium molecule which when activated by enzymatic reduction becomes charged and locks the dendrimer in the CNS . In some embodiments trigger agents are conjugated to the dendrimers so as to permit a controlled release of a particular agent e.g. a narcotic and or narcotic antagonist . The dendrimers are not limited to particular types of trigger agents. In some embodiments sustained release e.g. slow release over a period of 24 48 hours of the pain relief drug is accomplished through conjugating the pain relief drug to the dendrimer through for example a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that slowly degrades in a biological system e.g. ester linkage . In some embodiments constitutively active release of the pain relief drug is accomplished through conjugating the pain relief drug to the dendrimer through for example a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that renders the pain relief agent constitutively active in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ether linkage . In some embodiments the trigger agent is designed to permit release of the drug conjugated to the dendrimer in the presence of brain enzymes e.g. the trigger agent indolequinone is reduced by brain enzymes such as for example diaphorase . In some embodiments the trigger agent is designed to permit release of the drug conjugated to the dendrimer upon detection of reduced pO2 concentrations e.g. through use of a trigger agent that detects reduced pO2 levels e.g. a re dox linker . The use of a re dox linker provides direct physiological feed back in order to prevent consequences of opoid induced respiratory depression e.g. cerebral hypoxia .

These two characteristics differentiate the sustained release of a narcotic and the feedback release of a narcotic antagonist. For example in some embodiments the narcotic is linked such that it would remain constitutively active while coupled to the polymer or continuously released over time e.g. through triggering agents designed to permit sustained release to provide prolonged activity whereas in some embodiments the antagonist is active when released during hypoxia to prevent respiratory failure. In some embodiments the antagonist and agonist are attached to two identical populations of dendrimers in a very consistent manner and administered together or separately to form a single drug delivery system.

Accordingly the present invention provides compositions systems and methods for treating and or managing pain in a subject through use of dendrimers conjugated to pain relief agents and or pain relief agent antagonists. The following discussion describes individual component parts of the dendrimer and methods of making and using the same in some embodiments of the present invention.

Accordingly in some embodiments the present invention provides a linker conjugated to an agent e.g. therapeutic agent imaging agent targeting agent triggering agent e.g. that can be conjugated to a dendrimer e.g. for specific targeting and or therapeutic use of the dendrimer . Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides methods of synthesizing dendrimer conjugates e.g. PAMAM dendrimers comprising linkers e.g. conjugated to a trigger moiety therapeutic moiety and or other type of moiety compositions comprising the same and methods of using the same in the diagnosis imaging and treatment of disease e.g. cancer inflammatory disease chronic pain etc. .

The present invention provides a multiplicity of linkers and agents e.g. therapeutic agent imaging agent targeting agent triggering agent that find use in the present invention. Indeed the present invention is not limited to any particular linker or to any particular targeting agent or to any particular dendrimer. In some embodiments the present invention provides a dendrimer conjugated to a linker that is conjugated to an agent e.g. therapeutic agent imaging agent targeting agent triggering agent and methods of generating and using the same e.g. to treat cancer pain and or inflammation etc. . In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugated to a linker that is conjugated to an agent e.g. therapeutic agent imaging agent targeting agent triggering agent decreases the number of conjugation steps required to form a dendrimer e.g. a dendrimer conjugate e.g. a dendrimer conjugated to a targeting agent imaging agent therapeutic agent and or triggering agent . For example in some embodiments the present invention provides a customizable dendrimer wherein one or a plurality of linkers e.g. attached to one or a plurality of targeting agents triggering agents and or therapeutic agents are conjugated to a dendrimer thereby decreasing the number of conjugation steps used to form a dendrimer e.g. versus a dendrimer that is conjugated to a targeting moiety in one step and that is separately conjugated to a linker e.g. comprising a therapeutic agent imaging agent triggering agent or other moiety in an additional conjugation step . In some embodiments a linker conjugated to one or more agents e.g. therapeutic agents imaging agents targeting agents triggering agents is conjugated to one or more additional moieties including but not limited to a therapeutic agent a triggering agent an imaging agent a triggering agent etc. Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides a dendrimer with increased load capacity e.g. increased load of therapeutic imaging agent etc. on the dendrimer . In some embodiments two or more linkers e.g. conjugated to one or a plurality of targeting agents are conjugated to a dendrimer via the same or different linkage e.g. covalent linkage .

Several different schemes were evaluated for generating dendrimer conjugates wherein a dendrimer is conjugated to one or more linkers that comprise multiple sites for binding e.g. covalent binding moieties. For example in one embodiment a linker may comprise a chemical structure that allows for example conjugation of a targeting moiety and a therapeutic compound to the linker.

In some embodiments the present invention provides dendrimer molecules e.g. polyamideamine PAMAM dendrimers polypropylamine POPAM dendrimers or PAMAM POPAM dendrimers conjuguated to one or more pain relief agents e.g. prodrug analgesic molecules . In some embodiments the dendrimers conjugated to one or more pain relief agents e.g. prodrug analgesic molecules are configured for controlled and or sustained release of the pain relief agents e.g. through use of targeting agents linking agents and or trigger agents conjugated to the dendrimer and or pain relief agent . In some embodiments the pain relief agent conjugated to the dendrimer is active upon administration to a subject. In some embodiments sustained release e.g. slow release over a period of 24 48 hours of the pain relief agent is accomplished through conjugating the pain relief agent to the dendrimer through for example a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that slowly degrades in a biological system e.g. ester linkage . In some embodiments constitutively active release of the pain relief agent is accomplished through conjugating the pain relief agent to the dendrimer through for example a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that renders the pain relief agent constitutively active in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ether linkage . In some embodiments the dendrimers conjugated to one or more pain relief agents simultaneously configured for sustained release e.g. a slow release mechanism that achieves analgesic concentrations over a period of for example 24 48 hours of the pain relief agent prevents adverse side effects of the pain relief agent e.g. respiratory failure adverse cardiovascular consequences . The present invention further provides systems and methods for treating and or managing pain through utilization of dendrimers conjugated to one or more pain relief agents.

In some embodiments as shown in the present invention provides compositions comprising a plurality of pain relief agents e.g. Ketamine and Lorazepam coupled to dendrimers with a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent that slowly degrades in a biological system e.g. amide linkage ester linkage ether linkage as shown in the trigger agent is an ester bond that is released by serum esterases to mediate sustained release analgesia . When administered together Ketamine and Lorazepam have favorable analgesic and anxiolytic amnestic qualities and relatively broad therapeutic indexes. Such compositions comprising Ketamine and Lorazepam provide analgesia without the cardiovascular effects of opioids and minimize their major complication that being respiratory depression. As a feedback mechanism compositions comprising a pain relief agent antagonist e.g. Doxapram complexed with dendrimer through charge interaction that would be released by for example acidosis. While acidosis could be observed from causes other than respiratory depression this feedback mechanism is unique in that Doxapram stimulates respirations without reducing analgesia. As such there would not be an issue in releasing the Doxapram regardless of the source of the acidosis. Indeed the increased respiratory drive would be of benefit to compensate acidosis even when caused by metabolic sources from traumatic injuries hemorrhagic shock burns or rhabdomyolysis. One advantage to this approach is that it provides safe analgesia with easily achieved physiological feedback.

For example in some embodiments G5 dendrimers with different percentages of succinamic acid termini Scheme 3 wherein Doxapram molecules are encapsulated in the interior of dendrimers In such embodiments the negative charges on the dendrimer surface prevent the release of the drug due to the strong electrostatic interaction with the positively charged Doxapram hydrochloride. In such embodiments the drug is released once the dendrimer surface carboxyl groups are protonated with decreasing pH.

One of the dendrimers is conjugated to a morphine drug through a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent e.g. ester amide permitting sustained release.

Each of the dendrimers are targeted for CNS deliver through conjugation of targeting agents specific for the CNS e.g. transferrin a synthetic tetanus toxin fragment . Each of the dendrimers are designed for retention within the CNS through conjugation of locking agents designed to prevent back diffusion of the dendrimer across the BBB e.g. pyridinium molecule which when activated be enzymatic reduction becomes charged and locks the dendrimer in the CNS .

Neurobiology of Disease 2005. 19 3 p. 407 418 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The dendrimer conjugates are not limited to particular locking agents.

Buchwald Drug Discovery Today 2002. 7 14 p. 766 774 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In some embodiments the dendrimer conjugate device is eliminated from the CNS e.g. because of acquired hydrophilicity due to loss of the quaternary form . In some embodiments the pain relief agent and or pain relief agent antagonist is attached to the dendrimer through for example triggering agents designed for delayed release e.g. ester bonds amide bonds ether bonds . In some embodiments wherein the dendrimer conjugate comprises a pain relief agent antagonist e.g. Naloxone the pain relief agent antagonist is attached to the dendrimer through a linkage agent connected to a trigger agent e.g. re dox linker permitting release of the pain relief agent antagonist upon detection of reduced pO2 levels.

Thus in some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate comprises a receptor binding motif conjugated to a therapeutic agent e.g. cytotoxic drug thereby providing target specificity. Examples include but are not limited to a dendrimer conjugate comprising a prodrug e.g. of doxorubicin and or paclitaxel targeting integrin receptor a hyaluronic acid receptor and or a hormone receptor

In some embodiments the present invention provides a dendrimer conjugate comprising a trigger agent that is sensitive to e.g. is cleaved by and or activated by a nucleic acid. Nucleic acid triggered catalytic drug release can be utilized in the design of chemotherapeutic agents. Thus in some embodiments disease specific nucleic acid sequence is utilized as a drug releasing enzyme like catalyst e.g. via complex formation with a complimentary catalyst bearing nucleic acid and or analog . In some embodiments the release of a therapeutic agent is facilitated by the therapeutic component being attached to a labile protecting group such as for example cisplatin or methotrexate being attached to a photolabile protecting group that becomes released by laser light directed at cells emitting a color of fluorescence e.g. in addition to and or in place of target activated activation of a trigger component of a dendrimer conjugate . In some embodiments the therapeutic device also may have a component to monitor the response of the tumor to therapy. For example where a therapeutic agent of the dendrimer induces apoptosis of a target cell e.g. a cancer cell e.g. a prostate cancer cell the caspase activity of the cells may be used to activate a green fluorescence. This allows apoptotic cells to turn orange combination of red and green while residual cells remain red. Any normal cells that are induced to undergo apoptosis in collateral damage fluoresce green.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a dendrimer conjugate comprising a linker that connects to a therapeutic compound. In some embodiments the linker is configured such that its decomposition leads to the liberation e.g. non reversible liberation of the therapeutic agent e.g. pain relief agent e.g. at the target site e.g. site of tumor CNS and or inflammatory site . The linker may influence multiple characteristics of a dendrimer conjugate including but not limited to properties of the therapeutic agent e.g. stability pharmacokinetic organ distribution bioavailability and or enzyme recognition e.g. when the therapeutic agent e.g. prodrug is enzymatically activated .

In some embodiments the linker is an elimination linker. For example in some embodiments in a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention when a trigger is cleaved e.g. enzymatically and or chemically a phenol or an aniline promotes a facile 1 4 or 1 6 elimination followed by release of a COmolecule and the unmasked therapeutic agent e.g. drug See e.g. . In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention utilizes this configuration and or strategy to mask one or more hydroxyl groups and or amino groups of the therapeutic agents. In some embodiments a linker present within a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention is fine tuned e.g. to optimize stability and or drug release from the conjugate . For example the sizes of the aromatic substituents can be altered e.g. increased or decreased and or alkyl substitutions at the benzylic position may be made to alter e.g. increase or decrease degradation of the linker and or release of the therapeutic agent e.g. prodrug . In some embodiments elongated analogs e.g. double spacers are used e.g. to decrease steric hindrance e.g. for large therapeutic agents e.g. See FIG. . In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention comprises an enol based linker e.g. that undergoes an elimination reaction to release therapeutic agent e.g. prodrug .

In some embodiments the linker is a cyclization based linker. For example one configuration for this approach is shown in . A nucleophilic group e.g. OH or NHR that becomes available once the trigger is cleaved attacks the carbonyl of the C O X Therapeutic agent drug e.g. thereby leading to release of therapeutic agent XH and thereby to quickly release the Drug XH. In some embodiments a driving force that permits the reaction to reach completion is the stability of the cyclic product. In some embodiments a cyclization based linker of a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention include but are not limited to those shown in .

In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention comprises a combination of one or more linkers. For example in some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate comprises a combination of two or more elimination linkers. In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention comprises two or more cyclization linkers. In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention comprises a one or more elimination linkers and one or more cyclization linkers or a combination of one or more different types of linkers described herein. For example in some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate comprises a linker as shown in .

In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention comprises branched self elimination linkers e.g. as shown in . Thus in some embodiments use of branched linkers provides a conjugate that can present increased concentrations of a therapeutic agent to a target site e.g. inflammatory site tumor site etc. .

In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention is generated by a process comprising conjugating a pre formed tripartite piece e.g. trigger linker and therapeutic agent to a dendrimer e.g. a G5 PAMAM dendrimer or other type of dendrimer described herein e.g. conjugated to one or more different types of agents e.g. imaging agent . In some embodiments linkage between a tripartite piece and a dendrimer comprises a non cleavable bond e.g. an ether or an amide bond e.g. thereby decreasing unwanted activation of a trigger and or degradation of a linker and or release of therapeutic drug . In some embodiments a linker e.g. linear or other type of linker described herein is utilized to attach a tripartite moiety e.g. trigger linker and therapeutic agent to a dendrimer e.g. in order to increase drug release decrease steric hindrance and or increase stability of the dendrimer . For example in some embodiments the present invention provides a dendrimer conjugate as shown in .

In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention comprises a dendrimer conjugated to a linker e.g. optionally conjugated to a trigger that is conjugated to a therapeutic agent. In some embodiments the dendrimer conjugate comprises a self immolative connector between an ester bond e.g. that is to be cleaved and the therapeutic agent e.g. thereby enhancing drug release . For example although a mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention and the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism of action in some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention comprising an ester linkage undergoes esterase catalyzed hydrolysis e.g. as shown in e.g. G5 dendrimer comprising a self degradable spacer and therapeutic agent . Thus in contrast to a dendrimer comprising a simple ester e.g. a dendrimer in the top portion of wherein therapeutic agent release may or may not occur e.g. if x NH in some embodiments the present invention provides a dendrimer conjugate comprising an elimination linker e.g. a 1 6 elimination linker spacer as shown in the bottom portion of e.g. that permits complete hydrolysis of the linker e.g. at a target site .

The present invention is not limited by the type of linker configuration. In some embodiments the linker is conjugated via a free amino group via an amide linkage e.g. formed from an active ester e.g. the N hydroxysuccinimide ester . In some embodiments an ester linkage remains in the conjugate after conjugation. In some embodiments linkage occurs through a lysine residue. In some embodiments conjugation occurs through a short acting degradable linkage. The present invention is not limited by the type of degradable linkage utilized. Indeed a variety of linkages are contemplated to be useful in the present invention including but not limited to physiologically cleavable linkages including ester carbonate ester carbamate sulfate phosphate acyloxyalkyl ether acetal and ketal linkages. In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate comprises a cleavable linkage present in the linkage between the dendrimer and linker and or targeting agent and or therapeutic agent present therein e.g. such that when cleaved no portion of the linkage remains on the dendrimer . In some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate comprises a cleavable linkage present in the linker itself e.g. such that when cleaved a small portion of the linkage remains on the dendrimer .

The present invention is not limited by the type of therapeutic agent delivered via a dendrimer of the present invention. For example a therapeutic agent may be any agent selected from the group comprising but not limited to a pain relief agent a pain relief agent antagonist a chemotherapeutic agent an anti oncogenic agent an anti angiogenic agent a tumor suppressor agent an anti microbial agent or an expression construct comprising a nucleic acid encoding a therapeutic protein. Illustrative examples of these types of agents are described herein.

In some embodiments the therapeutic agent is a pain relief agent. The dendrimer conjugates of the present invention are not limited to a particular type or kind of pain relief agent.

In some embodiments the pain relief agents include several medications that have been used for field deployment and have a proven efficacy for military medical applications see e.g. Emergency war surgery. 3rd ed. 2004 Department of Defense USA herein incorporated by reference in its entirety see Table 1 . These drugs include but are not limited to Ketamine narcotics e.g. Morphine fentanyl hydromorphone benzodiazepines e.g. midazolam diazepam Lorazepam and the selective antagonist of narcotics e.g. Naloxone and benzodiazepines e.g. flumazenil . Military relevance is supported by the fact for example that small amounts of Morphine and Ketamine are used by medics during extraction evacuation of the injured from the battle field.

In some embodiments the pain relief agent is Ketamine. Ketamine is a potent analgesic amnestic and anxiolytic even in the low dose range while amnesia extends beyond its analgesic duration. Ketamine s therapeutic index is large and as levels are increased general anesthesia is achieved. Unlike other current general anesthetic agents vital functions e.g. neuromuscular tone airway patency respirations and cardiovascular function are maintained. All narcotic agents e.g. Morphine display effects opposite of those of Ketamine with respect to vital functions. As narcotic levels are increased respirations neuromuscular tone and airway patency are decreased while cardiovascular function may also be compromised particularly due to peripheral vasodilatation. Ketamine also induces bronchodilation which is particularly useful when irritants cause bronchoconstriction and coughing. Morphine suppresses coughing and either leaves bronchomotor tone unaltered or increases it see e.g. . 4th ed. 1994 Churchill Livingstone New York 9th ed. 1996 McGraw Hill Health Professions Division New York each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . When faced with severe injuries and blood loss low dose Ketamine provides analgesia and amnesia while preserving homeostatic mechanisms and vital functions. Ketamine levels can be increased to achieve a state of dissociation in which major procedures e.g. an amputation can be accomplished with cardio respiratory stability while the individual seems unattached to the procedure. Dissociation is unique to Ketamine.

In some embodiments the present invention provides dendrimer conjugates comprising Ketamine and Lorazepam. Unfortunately disforic reactions can occur in a small percentage of recipients but can be effectively treated with the concurrent administration of benzodiazepines e.g. Lorazepam . Lorazepam has excellent amnestic and anxiolytic properties which are very desirable in the severely injured combatant see e.g. 4th ed. 1994 Churchill Livingstone New York 9th ed. 1996 McGraw Hill Health Professions Division New York each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . It does not have analgesic nor anesthetic properties. It has mild centrally mediated muscle relaxant properties while it is an anticonvulsant. Its effects on homeostasis of the respiratory and hemodynamic system are mildly depressant when used in the dose range of its anxiolytic properties.

In some embodiments the pain relief agent is Morphine. Morphine is the standard against which all other analgesics are compared. It is less potent as an analgesic when compared to Ketamine. Its sedation can be accompanied by euphoria but its amnestic and anxiolytic effects are less when compared to Ketamine and Lorazepam. Even in high doses Morphine is a poor anesthetic and an unreliable amnestic but these properties may maintain co operativity on the battlefield. Morphine s analgesic effects overlap closely with its effects on homeostasis of the respiratory and hemodynamic system. Thus as the dosage of Morphine is increased depression of respirations and loss of airway patency and reflexes become soon apparent relative to Ketamine s effect. Its hemodynamic effects include veno vasodilatation within the range of Morphine s analgesia. Thus in the severely injured with blood loss Morphine s analgesic range is limited by its effects on homeostasis of vital functions. Morphine s therapeutic index particularly in the setting of the severely injured combatant is low compared to the index for Ketamine. Thus Morphine has many good qualities but should be administered in a manner to avoid side effects.

In some embodiments the pain relief agent antagonist is Doxapram. Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant causing an increase in tidal volume with an increase in respiratory rate used in acute respiratory insufficiency. It can improve cardiac output in the setting of hypovolemia. It may increase catecholamines release. Doxapram is useful as a respiratory and cardiovascular stimulant in the battlefield field setting to reduce or negate respiratory and hemodynamic effects of any proposed analgesic amnestic anxiolytic agents. Thus the release of Doxapram is a viable counter regulatory effect for respiratory depression whatever the cause.

In some embodiments the pain relief agent antagonist is Naloxone. Naloxone is an effective selective opioid e.g. Morphine antagonist. It reverses a range of Morphine s effects including Morphine s analgesia and respiratory depression. Although Morphine s analgesic and respiratory ranges overlap low dose infusions of Naloxone can reverse Morphine s respiratory depression while its analgesic effect is relatively unaffected and pain relief can remain present. Thus it is a prime candidate for a dendrimer drug delivery system requiring a Morphine feedback mechanism.

The dendrimers of the present invention find use in the detection and treatment of a variety of cancers. Indeed the present invention is not limited by the type of cancer to be treated. Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides compositions comprising dendrimer conjugates for the targeting and identification of angiogenesis associated with cancers e.g. carcinomas . For example in some embodiments a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention further comprises a targeting agent e.g. folic acid moiety that associates with high affinity to a targeting agent ligand e.g. receptor on a cancer cell e.g. carcinoma cells and or solid tumor cells . In some embodiments dendrimer conjugate and a targeting agent that target and identify cancer cells and or angiogenesis associated with cancer further comprise a therapeutic agent that inhibits angiogenesis thereby treating the cancer. In some embodiments treatment with dendrimer conjugates and an anti angiogenic agent are used in combination with other dendrimers of the present invention with other chemotherapeutic treatments and or as a treatment following surgical removal of a tumor or cancerous tissue. In some embodiments a targeting moiety e.g. folic acid or other targeting moiety described herein possesses a high affinity for ligands e.g. receptors or other types of proteins or molecules present on cancer cell possessing such ligands thereby permitting the targeting identification and treatment of disease e.g. cancer with little to no toxicity to surrounding healthy cells and tissue.

In some embodiments the present invention also provides a kit comprising a composition comprising dendrimer conjugate comprising a linker and or trigger and a therapeutic agent. In some embodiments the kit comprises a fluorescent agent or bioluminescent agent.

As is clear from the above example the use of the compositions of the present invention facilitates non intrusive sensing signaling and intervention for treating and managing pain cancer and other diseases and conditions. Since specific protocols of molecular alterations in cancer cells are identified using this technique non intrusive sensing through the dendrimers is achieved and may then be employed automatically against various tumor phenotypes. The present invention is not limited to a particular type of dendrimer.

Indeeed dendrimeric polymers have been described extensively See e.g. Tomalia Advanced Materials 6 529 1994 Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29 138 1990 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . Dendrimer polymers are synthesized as defined spherical structures typically ranging from 1 to 20 nanometers in diameter. Methods for manufactureing a G5 PAMAM dendrimer with a protected core is shown . In preferred embodiments the protected core diamine is NH2 CH2 CH2 NHPG. Molecular weight and the number of terminal groups increase exponentially as a function of generation the number of layers of the polymer See e.g. . Different types of dendrimers can be synthesized based on the core structure that initiates the polymerization process See e.g. .

The dendrimer core structures dictate several characteristics of the molecule such as the overall shape density and surface functionality See e.g. Tomalia et al. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29 5305 1990 . Spherical dendrimers can have ammonia as a trivalent initiator core or ethylenediamine EDA as a tetravalent initiator core See e.g. . Recently described rod shaped dendrimers See e.g. Yin et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120 2678 1998 use polyethyleneimine linear cores of varying lengths the longer the core the longer the rod. Dendritic macromolecules are available commercially in kilogram quantities and are produced under current good manufacturing processes GMP for biotechnology applications.

Dendrimers may be characterized by a number of techniques including but not limited to electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy See e.g. Example 5 and Example 7 high performance liquid chromatography See e.g. Example 5 and Example 6 size exclusion chromatography with multi angle laser light scattering See e.g. Example 4 ultraviolet spectrophotometry See e.g. Example 8 capillary electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis. These tests assure the uniformity of the polymer population and are important for monitoring quality control of dendrimer manufacture for GMP applications and in vivo usage.

Dendrimer antibody conjugates for use in in vitro diagnostic applications have previously been demonstrated See e.g. Singh et al. Clin. Chem. 40 1845 1994 for the production of dendrimer chelant antibody constructs and for the development of boronated dendrimer antibody conjugates for neutron capture therapy each of these latter compounds may be used as a cancer therapeutic See e.g. Wu et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 4 449 1994 Wiener et al. Magn. Reson. Med. 31 1 1994 Barth et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 5 58 1994 and Barth et al. .

Some of these conjugates have also been employed in the magnetic resonance imaging of tumors See e.g. Wu et al. 1994 and Wiener et al. 1994 supra . Results from this work have documented that when administered in vivo antibodies can direct dendrimer associated therapeutic agents to antigen bearing tumors. Dendrimers also have been shown to specifically enter cells and carry either chemotherapeutic agents or genetic therapeutics. In particular studies show that cisplatin encapsulated in dendrimer polymers has increased efficacy and is less toxic than cisplatin delivered by other means See e.g. Duncan and Malik Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 23 105 1996 .

Dendrimers have also been conjugated to fluorochromes or molecular beacons and shown to enter cells. They can then be detected within the cell in a manner compatible with sensing apparatus for evaluation of physiologic changes within cells See e.g. Baker et al. Anal. Chem. 69 990 1997 . Finally dendrimers have been constructed as differentiated block copolymers where the outer portions of the molecule may be digested with either enzyme or light induced catalysis See e.g. Urdea and Hom Science 261 534 1993 . This allows the controlled degradation of the polymer to release therapeutics at the disease site and provides a mechanism for an external trigger to release the therapeutic agents.

In some embodiments dendrimer conjugates of the present invention contain one or more signature identifying agents that are activated by or are able to interact with a signature component signature . In preferred embodiments the signature identifying agent is an antibody preferably a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the signature e.g. cell surface molecule specific to a cell to be targeted .

In some embodiments of the present invention tumor cells are identified. Tumor cells have a wide variety of signatures including the defined expression of cancer specific antigens such as Mucl HER 2 and mutated p53 in breast cancer. These act as specific signatures for the cancer being present in 30 HER 2 to 70 mutated p53 of breast cancers. In some embodiments a dendrimer of the present invention comprises a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a mutated version of p53 that is present in breast cancer. In some embodiments a dendrimer of the present invention comprises an antibody e.g. monoclonal antibody with high affinity for a signature including but not limited to Mucl and HER 2.

In some embodiments of the present invention cancer cells expressing susceptibility genes are identified. For example in some embodiments there are two breast cancer susceptibility genes that are used as specific signatures for breast cancer BRCA1 on chromosome 17 and BRCA2 on chromosome 13. When an individual carries a mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 they are at an increased risk of being diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer at some point in their lives. These genes participate in repairing radiation induced breaks in double stranded DNA. It is thought that mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 might disable this mechanism leading to more errors in DNA replication and ultimately to cancerous growth.

In addition the expression of a number of different cell surface receptors find use as targets for the binding and uptake of a dendrimer conjugate. Such receptors include but are not limited to EGF receptor folate receptor FGR receptor 2 and the like.

In some embodiments of the present invention changes in gene expression associated with chromosomal abborations are the signature component. For example Burkitt lymphoma results from chromosome translocations that involve the Myc gene. A chromosome translocation means that a chromosome is broken which allows it to associate with parts of other chromosomes. The classic chromosome translocation in Burkitt lymophoma involves chromosome 8 the site of the Myc gene. This changes the pattern of Myc expression thereby disrupting its usual function in controlling cell growth and proliferation.

From the discussion above it is clear that there are many different tumor signatures that find use with the present invention some of which are specific to a particular type of cancer and others which are promiscuous in their origin. The present invention is not limited to any particular tumor signature or any other disease specific signature. For example tumor suppressors that find use as signatures in the present invention include but are not limited to p53 Mucl CEA p16 p21 p27 CCAM RB APC DCC NF 1 NF 2 WT 1 MEN 1 MEN II p73 VHL FCC and MCC.

In some embodiments of the present invention a dendrimer conjugate comprises at least one imaging agent that can be readily imaged. The present invention is not limited by the nature of the imaging component used. In some embodiments of the present invention imaging modules comprise surface modifications of quantum dots See e.g. Chan and Nie Science 281 2016 1998 such as zinc sulfide capped cadmium selenide coupled to biomolecules Sooklal Adv. Mater. 10 1083 1998 .

In some embodiments the imaging module comprises dendrimers produced according to the nanocomposite concept See e.g. Balogh et al. Proc. of ACS PMSE 77 118 1997 and Balogh and Tomalia J. Am. Che. Soc. 120 7355 1998 . In these embodiments dendrimers are produced by reactive encapsulation where a reactant is preorganized by the dendrimer template and is then subsequently immobilized in on the polymer molecule by a second reactant. Size shape size distribution and surface functionality of these nanoparticles are determined and controlled by the dendritic macromolecules. These materials have the solubility and compatibility of the host and have the optical or physiological properties of the guest molecule i.e. the molecule that permits imaging . While the dendrimer host may vary according to the medium it is possible to load the dendrimer hosts with different compounds and at various guest concentration levels. Complexes and composites may involve the use of a variety of metals or other inorganic materials. The high electron density of these materials considerably simplifies the imaging by electron microscopy and related scattering techniques. In addition properties of inorganic atoms introduce new and measurable properties for imaging in either the presence or absence of interfering biological materials. In some embodiments of the present invention encapsulation of gold silver cobalt iron atoms molecules and or organic dye molecules such as fluorescein are encapsulated into dendrimers for use as nanoscopi composite labels tracers although any material that facilitates imaging or detection may be employed. In a preferred embodiment the imaging agent is fluorescein isothiocyanate

In some embodiments of the present invention imaging is based on the passive or active observation of local differences in density of selected physical properties of the investigated complex matter. These differences may be due to a different shape e.g. mass density detected by atomic force microscopy altered composition e.g. radiopaques detected by X ray distinct light emission e.g. fluorochromes detected by spectrophotometry different diffraction e.g. electron beam detected by TEM contrasted absorption e.g. light detected by optical methods or special radiation emission e.g. isotope methods etc. Thus quality and sensitivity of imaging depend on the property observed and on the technique used. The imaging techniques for cancerous cells have to provide sufficient levels of sensitivity to is observe small local concentrations of selected cells. The earliest identification of cancer signatures requires high selectivity i.e. highly specific recognition provided by appropriate targeting and the highest possible sensitivity.

In some embodiments once a targeted dendrimer conjugate has attached to or been internalized into a target cell e.g. tumor cell and or inflammatory cell one or more modules on the device serve to image its location. Dendrimers have already been employed as biomedical imaging agents perhaps most notably for magnetic resonance imaging MRI contrast enhancement agents See e.g. Wiener et al. Mag. Reson. Med. 31 1 1994 an example using PAMAM dendrimers . These agents are typically constructed by conjugating chelated paramagnetic ions such as Gd III diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid Gd III DTPA to water soluble dendrimers. Other paramagnetic ions that may be useful in this context include but are not limited to gadolinium manganese copper chromium iron cobalt erbium nickel europium technetium indium samarium dysprosium ruthenium ytterbium yttrium and holmium ions and combinations thereof. In some embodiments of the present invention a dendrimer conjugate is also conjugated to a targeting group such as epidermal growth factor EGF to make the conjugate specifically bind to the desired cell type e.g. in the case of EGF EGFR expressing tumor cells . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention DTPA is attached to dendrimers via the isothiocyanate of DTPA as described by Wiener Wiener et al. Mag. Reson. Med. 31 1 1994 .

Dendrimeric MRI agents are particularly effective due to the polyvalency size and architecture of dendrimers which results in molecules with large proton relaxation enhancements high molecular relaxivity and a high effective concentration of paramagnetic ions at the target site. Dendrimeric gadolinium contrast agents have even been used to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors using dynamic MRI based on how the vasculature for the latter type of tumor images more densely Adam et al. Ivest. Rad. 31 26 1996 . Thus MRI provides a particularly useful imaging system of the present invention.

Static structural microscopic imaging of cancerous cells and tissues has traditionally been performed outside of the patient. Classical histology of tissue biopsies provides a fine illustrative example and has proven a powerful adjunct to cancer diagnosis and treatment. After removal a specimen is sliced thin e.g. less than 40 microns stained fixed and examined by a pathologist. If images are obtained they are most often 2 D transmission bright field projection images. Specialized dyes are employed to provide selective contrast which is almost absent from the unstained tissue and to also provide for the identification of aberrant cellular constituents. Quantifying sub cellular structural features by using computer assisted analysis such as in nuclear ploidy determination is often confounded by the loss of histologic context owing to the thinness of the specimen and the overall lack of 3 D information. Despite the limitations of the static imaging approach it has been invaluable to allow for the identification of neoplasia in biopsied tissue. Furthermore its use is often the crucial factor in the decision to perform invasive and risky combinations of chemotherapy surgical procedures and radiation treatments which are often accompanied by severe collateral tissue damage complications and even patient death.

A dendrimer conjugate of the present invention allows functional microscopic imaging of tumors and provide improved methods for imaging. The methods find use in vivo in vitro and ex vivo. For example in one embodiment of the present invention dendrimer conjugates of the present invention are designed to emit light or other detectable signals upon exposure to light. Although the labeled dendrimers may be physically smaller than the optical resolution limit of the microscopy technique they become self luminous objects when excited and are readily observable and measurable using optical techniques. In some embodiments of the present invention sensing fluorescent biosensors in a microscope involves the use of tunable excitation and emission filters and multiwavelength sources See e.g. Farkas et al. SPEI 2678 200 1997 . In embodiments where the imaging agents are present in deeper tissue longer wavelengths in the Near infrared NMR are used See e.g. Lester et al. Cell Mol. Biol. 44 29 1998 . Dendrimeric biosensing in the Near IR has been demonstrated with dendrimeric biosensing antenna like architectures See e.g. Shortreed et al. J. Phys. Chem. 101 6318 1997 . Biosensors that find use with the present invention include but are not limited to fluorescent dyes and molecular beacons.

In some embodiments of the present invention in vivo imaging is accomplished using functional imaging techniques. Functional imaging is a complementary and potentially more powerful techniques as compared to static structural imaging. Functional imaging is best known for its application at the macroscopic scale with examples including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI and Positron Emission Tomography PET . However functional microscopic imaging may also be conducted and find use in in vivo and ex vivo analysis of living tissue. Functional microscopic imaging is an efficient combination of 3 D imaging 3 D spatial multispectral volumetric assignment and temporal sampling in short a type of 3 D spectral microscopic movie loop. Interestingly cells and tissues autofluoresce. When excited by several wavelengths providing much of the basic 3 D structure needed to characterize several cellular components e.g. the nucleus without specific labeling. Oblique light illumination is also useful to collect structural information and is used routinely. As opposed to structural spectral microimaging functional spectral microimaging may be used with biosensors which act to localize physiologic signals within the cell or tissue. For example in some embodiments of the present invention biosensor comprising dendrimers of the present invention are used to image upregulated receptor families such as the folate or EGF classes. In such embodiments functional biosensing therefore involves the detection of physiological abnormalities relevant to carcinogenesis or malignancy even at early stages. A number of physiological conditions may be imaged using the compositions and methods of the present invention including but not limited to detection of nanoscopic dendrimeric biosensors for pH oxygen concentration Ca concentration and other physiologically relevant analytes.

In some embodiments the present invention provides dendrimer conjugates having a biological monitoring component. The biological monitoring or sensing component of a dendrimer conjugate of the present invention is one that can monitor the particular response in a target cell e.g. tumor cell induced by an agent e.g. a therapeutic agent provided by the therapeutic component of the dendrimer conjugate . While the present invention is not limited to any particular monitoring system the invention is illustrated by methods and compositions for monitoring cancer treatments. In preferred embodiments of the present invention the agent induces apoptosis in cells and monitoring involves the detection of apoptosis. In particular embodiments the monitoring component is an agent that fluoresces at a particular wavelength when apoptosis occurs. For example in a preferred embodiment caspase activity activates green fluorescence in the monitoring component. Apoptotic cancer cells which have turned red as a result of being targeted by a particular signature with a red label turn orange while residual cancer cells remain red. Normal cells induced to undergo apoptosis e.g. through collateral damage if present will fluoresce green.

In these embodiments fluorescent groups such as fluorescein are employed in the monitoring component. Fluorescein is easily attached to the dendrimer surface via the isothiocyanate derivatives available from MOLECULAR PROBES Inc. This allows the dendrimer conjugate to be imaged with the cells via confocal microscopy. Sensing of the effectiveness of the dendrimer conjugates is preferably achieved by using fluorogenic peptide enzyme substrates. For example apoptosis caused by the therapeutic agents results in the production of the peptidase caspase 1 ICE . CALBIOCHEM sells a number of peptide substrates for this enzyme that release a fluorescent moiety. A particularly useful peptide for use in the present invention is 

In some embodiments of the present invention the lysine end of the peptide is linked to the dendrimer conjugate so that the MCA group is released into the cytosol when it is cleaved. The lysine end of the peptide is a useful synthetic handle for conjugation because for example it can react with the activated ester group of a bifunctional linker such as Mal PEG OSu. Thus the appearance of green fluorescence in the target cells produced using these methods provides a clear indication that apoptosis has begun if the cell already has a red color from the presence of aggregated quantum dots the cell turns orange from the combined colors .

Additional fluorescent dyes that find use with the present invention include but are not limited to acridine orange reported as sensitive to DNA changes in apoptotic cells Abrams et al. Development 117 29 1993 and cis parinaric acid sensitive to the lipid peroxidation that accompanies apoptosis Hockenbery et al. Cell 75 241 1993 . It should be noted that the peptide and the fluorescent dyes are merely exemplary. It is contemplated that any peptide that effectively acts as a substrate for a caspase produced as a result of apoptosis finds use with the present invention.

In some embodiments conjugation between a dendrimer e.g. terminal arm of a dendrimer and a functional group or between functional groups is accomplished through use of a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction click chemistry . Click chemistry involves for example the coupling of two different moieties e.g. a therapeutic agent and a functional group e.g. a first functional group and a second functional group via a 1 3 dipolar cycloaddition reaction between an alkyne moiety or equivalent thereof on the surface of the first moeity and an azide moiety e.g. present on a triazine composition or equivalent thereof or any active end group such as for example a primary amine end group a hydroxyl end group a carboxylic acid end group a thiol end group etc. on the second moiety see e.g. U.S. Provisional Patent App. No. 61 140 480 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Click chemistry is an attractive coupling method because for example it can be performed with a wide variety of solvent conditions including aqueous environments. For example the stable triazole ring that results from coupling the alkyne with the azide is frequently achieved at quantitative yields and is considered to be biologically inert see e.g. Rostovtsev V. V. et al. Angewandte Chemie International Edition 2002 41 14 2596 Wu P. et al. Angewandte Chemie International Edition 2004 43 30 3928 3932 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

In some embodiments conjugation between a dendrimer e.g. a terminal arm of a dendrimer and a functional ligand is accomplished during a one pot reaction. The term one pot synthesis reaction or equivalents thereof e.g. 1 pot one pot etc. refers to a chemical synthesis method in which all reactants are present in a single vessel. Reactants may be added simultaneously or sequentially with no limitation as to the duration of time elapsing between introduction of sequentially added reactants. In some embodiments a one pot reaction occurs wherein a hydroxyl terminated dendrimer e.g. HO PAMAM dendrimer is reacted with one or more functional ligands e.g. a therapeutic agent a pro drug a trigger agent a targeting agent an imaging agent in one vessel such conjugation being facilitated by ester coupling agents e.g. 2 chloro 1 methylpyridinium iodide and 4 dimethylamino pyridine see e.g. U.S. Provisional Patent App. No. 61 226 993 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Functionalized nanoparticles e.g. dendrimers often contain moieties including but not limited to ligands functional ligands conjugates therapeutic agents targeting agents imaging agents fluorophores that are conjugated to the periphery. Such moieties may for example be conjugated to one or more dendrimer branch termini. Classical multi step conjugation strategies used during the synthesis of functionalized dendrimers generate a stochastic distribution of products with differing numbers of ligands attached per dendrimer molecule thereby creating a population of dendrimers with a wide distribution in the numbers of ligands attached. The low structural uniformity of such dendrimer populations negatively affects properties such as therapeutic potency pharmacokinetics or effectiveness for multivalent targeting. Difficulties in quantifying and resolving such populations to yield samples with sufficient structural uniformity can pose challenges. However in some embodiments use of separation methods e.g. reverse phase chromatography customized for optimal separation of dendrimer populations in conjunction with peak fitting analysis methods allows isolation and identification of subpopulations of functionalized dendrimers with high structural uniformity see e.g. U.S. Provisional Pat. App. No. 61 237 172 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In certain embodiments such methods and systems provide a dendrimer product made by the process comprising a conjugation of at least one ligand type to a dendrimer to yield a population of ligand conjugated dendrimers b separation of the population of ligand conjugated dendrimers with reverse phase HPLC to result in subpopulations of ligand conjugated dendrimers indicated by a chromatographic trace and c application of peak fitting analysis to the chromatographic trace to identify subpopulations of ligand conjugated dendrimers wherein the structural uniformity of ligand conjugates per molecule of dendrimer within said subpopulation is e.g. approximately 80 or more.

As described above another component of the present invention is that the dendrimer conjugate compositions are able to specifically target a particular tissue region and or cell type e.g. CNS . In some embodiments the dendrimer conjugate targets the CNS e.g. via transferrin neurons within the CNS e.g. via Tet1 the peripheral nervous system muscles and or nerves.

In some embodiments of the present invention targeting groups are conjugated to dendrimers and or linkers conjugated to the dendrimers with either short e.g. direct coupling medium e.g. using small molecule bifunctional linkers such as SPDP sold by PIERCE CHEMICAL Company or long e.g. PEG bifunctional linkers sold by NEKTAR Inc. linkages. Since dendrimers have surfaces with a large number of functional groups more than one targeting group and or linker may be attached to each dendrimer. As a result multiple binding events may occur between the dendrimer conjugate and the target cell. In these embodiments the dendrimer conjugates have a very high affinity for their target cells via this cooperative binding or polyvalent interaction effect.

For steric reasons in some embodiments the smaller the ligands the more can be attached to the surface of a dendrimer and or linkers attached thereto. Recently Wiener reported that dendrimers with attached folic acid would specifically accumulate on the surface and within tumor cells expressing the high affinity folate receptor hFR See e.g. Wiener et al. Invest. Radiol. 32 748 1997 . The hFR receptor is expressed or upregulated on epithelial tumors including breast cancers. Control cells lacking hFR showed no significant accumulation of folate derivatized dendrimers. Folic acid can be attached to full generation PAMAM dendrimers via a carbodiimide coupling reaction. Folic acid is a good targeting candidate for the dendrimers with its small size and a simple conjugation procedure.

Antibodies can be generated to allow for the targeting of antigens or immunogens e.g. tumor tissue or pathogen specific antigens on various biological targets e.g. pathogens tumor cells normal tissue . Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal chimeric single chain Fab fragments and an Fab expression library.

In some embodiments the antibodies recognize tumor specific epitopes e.g. TAG 72 See e.g. Kjeldsen et al. Cancer Res. 48 2214 2220 1988 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 892 020 5 892 019 and 5 512 443 human carcinoma antigen See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 693 763 5 545 530 and 5 808 005 TP1 and TP3 antigens from osteocarcinoma cells See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 855 866 Thomsen Friedenreich TF antigen from adenocarcinoma cells See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 110 911 KC 4 antigen from human prostrate adenocarcinoma See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 708 930 and 4 743 543 a human colorectal cancer antigen See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 921 789 CA125 antigen from cystadenocarcinoma See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 921 790 DF3 antigen from human breast carcinoma See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 963 484 and 5 053 489 a human breast tumor antigen See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 939 240 p97 antigen of human melanoma See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 918 164 carcinoma or orosomucoid related antigen CORA See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 914 021 a human pulmonary carcinoma antigen that reacts with human squamous cell lung carcinoma but not with human small cell lung carcinoma See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 892 935 T and Tn haptens in glycoproteins of human breast carcinoma See e.g. Springer et al. Carbohydr. Res. 178 271 292 1988 MSA breast carcinoma glycoprotein termed See e.g. Tjandra et al. Br. J. Surg. 75 811 817 1988 MFGM breast carcinoma antigen See e.g. Ishida et al. Tumor Biol. 10 12 22 1989 DU PAN 2 pancreatic carcinoma antigen See e.g. Lan et al. Cancer Res. 45 305 310 1985 CA125 ovarian carcinoma antigen See e.g. Hanisch et al. Carbohydr. Res. 178 29 47 1988 YH206 lung carcinoma antigen See e.g. Hinoda et al. 1988 Cancer J. 42 653 658 1988 .

Various procedures known in the art are used for the production of polyclonal antibodies. For the production of antibody various host animals can be immunized by injection with the peptide corresponding to the desired epitope including but not limited to rabbits mice rats sheep goats etc. In a preferred embodiment the peptide is conjugated to an immunogenic carrier e.g. diphtheria toxoid bovine serum albumin BSA or keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH . Various adjuvants are used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG Bacille Calmette Guerin and

For preparation of monoclonal antibodies any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture may be used See e.g. Harlow and Lane Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. . These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler and Milstein Kohler and Milstein Nature 256 495 497 1975 as well as the trioma technique the human B cell hybridoma technique See e.g. Kozbor et al. Immunol. Today 4 72 1983 and the EBV hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies Cole et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 1985 .

In an additional embodiment of the invention monoclonal antibodies can be produced in germ free animals utilizing recent technology See e.g. PCT US90 02545 . According to the invention human antibodies may be used and can be obtained by using human hybridomas Cote et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80 2026 2030 1983 or by transforming human B cells with EBV virus in vitro Cole et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss pp. 77 96 1985 .

According to the invention techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 herein incorporated by reference can be adapted to produce specific single chain antibodies. An additional embodiment of the invention utilizes the techniques described for the construction of Fab expression libraries Huse et al. Science 246 1275 1281 1989 to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity.

Antibody fragments that contain the idiotype antigen binding region of the antibody molecule can be generated by known techniques. For example such fragments include but are not limited to the F ab 2 fragment that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule the Fab fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab 2 fragment and the Fab fragments that can be generated by treating the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent.

In the production of antibodies screening for the desired antibody can be accomplished by techniques known in the art e.g. radioimmunoassay ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbant assay sandwich immunoassays immunoradiometric assays gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays in situ immunoassays using colloidal gold enzyme or radioisotope labels for example Western Blots precipitation reactions agglutination assays e.g. gel agglutination assays hemagglutination assays etc. complement fixation assays immunofluorescence assays protein A assays and immunoelectrophoresis assays etc. .

The dendrimer conjugates of the present invention have many advantages over liposomes such as their greater stability better control of their size and polydispersity and generally lower toxicity and immunogenicity See e.g. Duncan et al Polymer Preprints 39 180 1998 . Thus in some embodiments of the present invention anti HER2 antibody fragments as well as other targeting antibodies are conjugated to dendrimers as targeting agents for the nanodevices of the present invention.

The bifunctional linkers SPDP and SMCC and the longer Mal PEG OSu linkers are particularly useful for antibody dendrimer conjugation. In addition many tumor cells contain surface lectins that bind to oligosaccharides with specific recognition arising chiefly from the terminal carbohydrate residues of the latter See e.g. Sharon and Lis Science 246 227 1989 . Attaching appropriate monosaccharides to nonglycosylated proteins such as BSA provides a conjugate that binds to tumor lectin much more tightly than the free monosaccharide See e.g. Monsigny et al. Biochemie 70 1633 1988 .

Mannosylated PAMAM dendrimers bind mannoside binding lectin up to 400 more avidly than monomeric mannosides See e.g. Page and Roy Bioconjugate Chem. 8 714 1997 . Sialylated dendrimers and other dendritic polymers bind to and inhibit a variety of sialate binding viruses both in vitro and in vivo. By conjugating multiple monosaccharide residues e.g. galactoside for galactose binding cells to dendrimers polyvalent conjugates are created with a high affinity for the corresponding type of tumor cell. The attachment reaction are easily carried out via reaction of the terminal amines with commercially available galactosidyl phenylisothiocyanate. The small size of the carbohydrates allows a high concentration to be present on the dendrimer surface.

Related to the targeting approaches described above is the pretargeting approach See e.g. Goodwin and Meares Cancer suppl. 80 2675 1997 . An example of this strategy involves initial treatment of a subject with conjugates of tumor specific monoclonal antibodies and streptavidin. Remaining soluble conjugate is removed from the bloodstream with an appropriate biotinylated clearing agent. When the tumor localized conjugate is all that remains a radiolabeled biotinylated agent is introduced which in turn localizes at the tumor sites by the strong and specific biotin streptavidin interaction. Thus the radioactive dose is maximized in dose proximity to the cancer cells and minimized in the rest of the body where it can harm healthy cells.

It has been shown that if streptavidin molecules bound to a polystyrene well are first treated with a biotinylated dendrimer and then radiolabeled streptavidinis introduced up to four of the labeled streptavidin molecules are bound per polystyrene bound streptavidin See e.g. Wilbur et al. Bioconjugate Chem. 9 813 1998 . Thus biotinylated dendrimers may be used in the methods of the present invention acting as a polyvalent receptor for the radiolabel in vivo with a resulting amplification of the radioactive dosage per bound antibody conjugate. In the preferred embodiments of the present invention one or more multiply biotinylated module s on the clustered dendrimer presents a polyvalent target for radiolabeled or boronated See e.g. Barth et al. Cancer Investigation 14 534 1996 avidin or streptavidin again resulting in an amplified dose of radiation for the tumor cells.

Dendrimers may also be used as clearing agents by for example partially biotinylating a dendrimer that has a polyvalent galactose or mannose surface. The conjugate clearing agent complex would then have a very strong affinity for the corresponding hepatocyte receptors.

In other embodiments of the present invention an enhanced permeability and retention EPR method is used in targeting. The enhanced permeability and retention EPR effect is a more passive way of targeting tumors See e.g. Duncan and Sat Ann. Oncol. 9 39 1998 . The EPR effect is the selective concentration of macromolecules and small particles in the tumor microenvironment caused by the hyperpermeable vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumors. The dendrimer compositions of the present invention provide ideal polymers for this application in that they are relatively rigid of narrow polydispersity of controlled size and surface chemistry and have interior cargo space that can carry and then release antitumor drugs. In fact PAMAM dendrimer platinates have been shown to accumulate in solid tumors Pt levels about 50 times higher than those obtained with cisplatin and have in vivo activity in solid tumor models for which cisplatin has no effect See e.g. Malik et al. Proc. Int l. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24 107 1997 and Duncan et al. Polymer Preprints 39 180 1998 .

In some embodiments of the present invention the preparation of PAMAM dendrimers is performed according to a typical divergent building up the macromolecule from an initiator core synthesis. It involves a two step growth sequence that includes of a Michael addition of amino groups to the double bond of methyl acrylate MA followed by the amidation of the resulting terminal carbomethoxy COCH group with ethylenediamine EDA .

In the first step of this process ammonia is allowed to react under an inert nitrogen atmosphere with MA molar ratio 1 4.25 at 47 C. for 48 hours. The resulting compound is referred to as generation 0 the star branched PAMAM tri ester. The next step involves reacting the tri ester with an excess of EDA to produce the star branched PAMAM tri amine G O . This reaction is performed under an inert atmosphere nitrogen in methanol and requires 48 hours at 0 C. for completion. Reiteration of this Michael addition and amidation sequence produces generation 1.

Preparation of this tri amine completes the first full cycle of the divergent synthesis of PAMAM dendrimers. Repetition of this reaction sequence results in the synthesis of larger generation G 1 5 dendrimers i.e. ester and amine terminated molecules respectively . For example the second iteration of this sequence produces generation 1 with an hexa ester and hexa amine surface respectively. The same reactions are performed in the same way as for all subsequent generations from 1 to 9 building up layers of branch cells giving a core shell architecture with precise molecular weights and numbers of terminal groups as shown above. Carboxylate surfaced dendrimers can be produced by hydrolysis of ester terminated PAMAM dendrimers or reaction of succinic anhydride with amine surfaced dendrimers e.g. full generation PAMAM POPAM or POPAM PAMAM hybrid dendrimers .

Various dendrimers can be synthesized based on the core structure that initiates the polymerization process. These core structures dictate several important characteristics of the dendrimer molecule such as the overall shape density and surface functionality See e.g. Tomalia et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 29 5305 1990 . Spherical dendrimers derived from ammonia possess trivalent initiator cores whereas EDA is a tetra valent initiator core. Recently rod shaped dendrimers have been reported which are based upon linear poly ethyleneimine cores of varying lengths the longer the core the longer the rod See e.g. Yin et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120 2678 1998 .

In some embodiments dendrimers of the present invention comprise a protected core diamine. In some embodiments the protected initiator core diamine is NH2 CH2 NHPG n 1 10 . In other embodiments the intitor core is selected from the group comprising but not limited to NH2 CH2 NH2 n 1 10 NH2 CH2 NH2 n 1 10 or unsubstituted or substituted 1 2 1 3 or 1 4 phenylenedi n alkylamine with a monoprotected diamine e.g. NH2 CH2 NHPG used during the amide formation of each generation. In these approaches the protected diamine allows for the large scale production of dendrimers without the production of non uniform nanostructures that can make characterization and analysis difficult. By limiting the reactivity of the diamine to only one terminus the opportunities of dimmer polymer formation and intramolecular reactions are obviated without the need of employing large excesses of diamine. The terminus monoprotected intermediates can be readily purified since the protecting groups provide suitable handle for productive purifications by classical techniques like crystallization and or chromatography.

The protected intermediates can be deprotected in a deprotection step and the resulting generation of the dendrimer subjected to the next iterative chemical reaction without the need for purification. The invention is not limited to a particular protecting group. Indeed a variety of protecting groups are contemplated including but not limited to t butoxycarbamate N t Boc allyloxycarbamate N Alloc benzylcarbamate N Cbz 9 fluorenylmethylcarbamate FMOC or phthalimide Phth . In preferred embodiments of the present invention the protecting group is benzylcarbamate N Cbz . N Cbz is ideal for the the present invention since it alone can be easily cleaved under neutral conditions by catalytic hydrogenation Pd C without resorting to strongly acidic or basic conditions needed to remove an F MOC group. The use of protected monomers finds particular use in high through put production runs because a lower amount of monomer can be used reducing production costs.

The dendrimers may be characterized for size and uniformity by any suitable analytical techniques. These include but are not limited to atomic force microscopy AFM electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy MALDI TOF mass spectroscopy C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy high performance liquid chromatography HPLC size exclusion chromatography SEC equipped with multi angle laser light scattering dual UV and refractive index detectors capillary electrophoresis and get electrophoresis. These analytical methods assure the uniformity of the dendrimer population and are important in the quality control of dendrimer production for eventual use in in vivo applications. Most importantly extensive work has been performed with dendrimers showing no evidence of toxicity when administered intravenously Roberts et al. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 30 53 1996 and Boume et al. J. Magnetic Resonance Imaging 6 305 1996 .

In some embodiments of the present invention the dendrimer conjugates comprise transgenes for delivery and expression to a target cell or tissue in vitro ex vivo or in vivo. In such embodiments rather than containing the actual protein the dendrimer complex comprises an expression vector construct containing for example a heterologous DNA encoding a gene of interest and the various regulatory elements that facilitate the production of the particular protein of interest in the target cells.

In some embodiments the gene is a therapeutic gene that is used for example to treat cancer to replace a defective gene or a marker or reporter gene that is used for selection or monitoring purposes. In the context of a gene therapy vector the gene may be a heterologous piece of DNA. The heterologous DNA may be derived from more than one source i.e. a multigene construct or a fusion protein . Further the heterologous DNA may include a regulatory sequence derived from one source and the gene derived from a different source.

Tissue specific promoters may be used to effect transcription in specific tissues or cells so as to reduce potential toxicity or undesirable effects to non targeted tissues. For example promoters such as the PSA probasin prostatic acid phosphatase or prostate specific glandular kallikrein hK2 may be used to target gene expression in the prostate. Similarly promoters may be used to target gene expression in other tissues e.g. insulin elastin amylase pdr 1 pdx 1 and glucokinase promoters target to the pancreas albumin PEPCK HBV enhancer alpha fetoproteinapolipoprotein C alpha 1 antitrypsin vitellogenin NF AB and transthyretin promoters target to the liver myosin H chain muscle creatine kinase dystrophin calpain p94 skeletal alpha actin fast troponin 1 promoters target to skeletal muscle keratin promoters target the skin sm22 alpha SM .alpha. actin promoters target smooth muscle CFTR human cytokeratin 18 K18 pulmonary surfactant proteins A B and Q CC 10 P1 promoters target lung tissue endothelin 1 E selectin von Willebrand factor KDR flk 1 target the endothelium tyrosinase targets melanocytes .

The nucleic acid may be either cDNA or genomic DNA. The nucleic acid can encode any suitable therapeutic protein. Preferably the nucleic acid encodes a tumor suppressor cytokine receptor inducer of apoptosis or differentiating agent. The nucleic acid may be an antisense nucleic acid. In such embodiments the antisense nucleic acid may be incorporated into the nanodevice of the present invention outside of the context of an expression vector.

In preferred embodiments the nucleic acid encodes a tumor suppressor cytokines receptors or inducers of apoptosis. Suitable tumor suppressors include BRCA1 BRCA2 C CAM p16 p211 p53 p73 or Rb. Suitable cytokines include GMCSF IL 1 IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL6 IL 7 IL 8 IL 9 IL 10 IL 11 IL 12 IL 13 IL 14 IL 15 interferon interferon or TNF. Suitable receptors include CFTR EGFR estrogen receptor IL 2 receptor or VEGFR. Suitable inducers of apoptosis include AdE1B Bad Bak Bax Bid Bik Bim Harakiri or ICE CED3 protease.

In some embodiments more than one administration of the dendrimer conjugates of the present invention or the other agent are utilized. Various combinations may be employed where the dendrimer is A e.g. comprising a pain relief agent and the other agent is B e.g. comprising a pain relief agent antagonist as exemplified below A B A B A B B B A A A B B A A A B B B B B A B B A B A A B B A B A B A B B A B B A A B A B A B A A B B B B A A A A B B A A A A B A A A A B A A B B B B A B B B B A B.

Other factors that may be used in combination therapy with the dendrimer conjugates of the present invention include but are not limited to factors that cause DNA damage such as gamma rays X rays and or the directed delivery of radioisotopes to tumor cells. Other forms of DNA damaging factors are also contemplated such as microwaves and UV irradiation. Dosage ranges for X rays range from daily doses of 50 to 200 roentgens for prolonged periods of time 3 to 4 weeks to single doses of 2000 to 6000 roentgens. Dosage ranges for radioisotopes vary widely and depend on the half life of the isotope the strength and type of radiation emitted and the uptake by the neoplastic cells. The skilled artisan is directed to Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 15th Edition chapter 33 in particular pages 624 652. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will in any event determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover for human administration preparations should meet sterility pyrogenicity general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.

In preferred embodiments of the present invention the regional delivery of the dendrimer conjugates to patients with cancers is utilized to maximize the therapeutic effectiveness of the delivered agent. Similarly the chemo or radiotherapy may be directed to particular affected region of the subjects body. Alternatively systemic delivery of the immunotherapeutic composition and or the agent may be appropriate in certain circumstances for example where extensive metastasis has occurred.

In addition to combining the dendrimer conjugates with chemo and radiotherapies it also is contemplated that traditional gene therapies are used. For example targeting of p53 or p16 mutations along with treatment of the dendrimer conjugates provides an improved anti cancer treatment. The present invention contemplates the co treatment with other tumor related genes including but not limited to p21 Rb APC DCC NF I NF 2 BCRA2 p16 FHIT WT I MEN I MEN II BRCA1 VHL FCC MCC ras myc neu raf erb src fms jun trk ret gsp hst bcl and abl.

In vivo and ex vivo treatments are applied using the appropriate methods worked out for the gene delivery of a particular construct for a particular subject. For example for viral vectors one typically delivers 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10or 1 10infectious particles to the patient. Similar figures may be extrapolated for liposomal or other non viral formulations by comparing relative uptake efficiencies.

An attractive feature of the present invention is that the therapeutic compositions may be delivered to local sites in a patient by a medical device. Medical devices that are suitable for use in the present invention include known devices for the localized delivery of therapeutic agents. Such devices include but are not limited to catheters such as injection catheters balloon catheters double balloon catheters microporous balloon catheters channel balloon catheters infusion catheters perfusion catheters etc. which are for example coated with the therapeutic agents or through which the agents are administered needle injection devices such as hypodermic needles and needle injection catheters needleless injection devices such as jet injectors coated stents bifurcated stents vascular grafts stent grafts etc. and coated vaso occlusive devices such as wire coils.

Exemplary devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 935 114 5 908 413 5 792 105 5 693 014 5 674 192 5 876 445 5 913 894 5 868 719 5 851 228 5 843 089 5 800 519 5 800 508 5 800 391 5 354 308 5 755 722 5 733 303 5 866 561 5 857 998 5 843 003 and 5 933 145 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary stents that are commercially available and may be used in the present application include the RADIUS SCIMED LIFE SYSTEMS Inc. the SYMPHONY Boston Scientific Corporation the Wallstent Schneider Inc. the PRECEDENT II Boston Scientific Corporation and the NIR Medinol Inc. . Such devices are delivered to and or implanted at target locations within the body by known techniques.

In some embodiments the therapeutic complexes of the present invention comprise a photodynamic compound and a targeting agent that is administered to a patient. In some embodiments the targeting agent is then allowed a period of time to bind the target cell e.g. about 1 minute to 24 hours resulting in the formation of a target cell target agent complex. In some embodiments the therapeutic complexes comprising the targeting agent and photodynamic compound are then illuminated e.g. with a red laser incandescent lamp X rays or filtered sunlight . In some embodiments the light is aimed at the jugular vein or some other superficial blood or lymphatic vessel. In some embodiments the singlet oxygen and free radicals diffuse from the photodynamic compound to the target cell e.g. cancer cell or pathogen causing its destruction.

Where clinical applications are contemplated in some embodiments of the present invention the dendrimer conjugates are prepared as part of a pharmaceutical composition in a form appropriate for the intended application. Generally this entails preparing compositions that are essentially free of pyrogens as well as other impurities that could be harmful to humans or animals. However in some embodiments of the present invention a straight dendrimer formulation may be administered using one or more of the routes described herein.

In preferred embodiments the dendrimer conjugates are used in conjunction with appropriate salts and buffers to render delivery of the compositions in a stable manner to allow for uptake by target cells. Buffers also are employed when the dendrimer conjugates are introduced into a patient. Aqueous compositions comprise an effective amount of the dendrimer conjugates to cells dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or aqueous medium. Such compositions also are referred to as inocula. The phrase pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce adverse allergic or other untoward reactions when administered to an animal or a human. As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the vectors or cells of the present invention its use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients may also be incorporated into the compositions.

In some embodiments of the present invention the active compositions include classic pharmaceutical preparations. Administration of these compositions according to the present invention is via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via that route. This includes oral nasal buccal rectal vaginal or topical. Alternatively administration may be by orthotopic intradermal subcutaneous intramuscular intraperitoneal or intravenous injection.

The active dendrimer conjugates may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally or intratumorally. Solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts are prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.

In some embodiments a therapeutic agent is released from dendrimer conjugates within a target cell e.g. within an endosome . This type of intracellular release e.g. endosomal disruption of a linker therapeutic conjugate is contemplated to provide additional specificity for the compositions and methods of the present invention. In some embodiments the dendrimer conjugates of the present invention contain between 100 150 primary amines on the surface. Thus the present invention provides dendrimers with multiple e.g. 100 150 reactive sites for the conjugation of linkers and or functional groups comprising but not limited to therapeutic agents targeting agents imaging agents and biological monitoring agents.

The compositions and methods of the present invention are contemplated to be equally effective whether or not the dendrimer conjugates of the present invention comprise a fluorescein e.g. FITC imaging agent. Thus each functional group present in a dendrimer composition is able to work independently of the other functional groups. Thus the present invention provides dendrimer conjugates that can comprise multiple combinations of targeting therapeutic imaging and biological monitoring functional groups. Additionally in some embodiments each functional group e.g. therapeutic agents targeting agents imaging agents and biological monitoring agents present in a dendrimer composition can function together with one or more of the functional groups e.g. cooperative binding of multiple targeting ligands .

The present invention also provides a very effective and specific method of delivering molecules e.g. therapeutic and imaging functional groups to the interior of target cells e.g. cancer cells . Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides methods of therapy that comprise or require delivery of molecules into a cell in order to function e.g. delivery of genetic material such as siRNAs .

The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The carrier may be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial an antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it may be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

Upon formulation dendrimer conjugates are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as injectable solutions drug release capsules and the like. For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution for example the solution is suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. For example one dosage could be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion see for example Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 15th Edition pages 1035 1038 and 1570 1580 . In some embodiments of the present invention the active particles or agents are formulated within a therapeutic mixture to comprise about 0.0001 to 1.0 milligrams or about 0.001 to 0.1 milligrams or about 0.1 to 1.0 or even about 10 milligrams per dose or so. Multiple doses may be administered.

Additional formulations that are suitable for other modes of administration include vaginal suppositories and pessaries. A rectal pessary or suppository may also be used. Suppositories are solid dosage forms of various weights and shapes usually medicated for insertion into the rectum vagina or the urethra. After insertion suppositories soften melt or dissolve in the cavity fluids. In general for suppositories traditional binders and carriers may include for example polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides such suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range of 0.5 to 10 preferably 1 2 . Vaginal suppositories or pessaries are usually globular or oviform and weighing about 5 g each. Vaginal medications are available in a variety of physical forms e.g. creams gels or liquids which depart from the classical concept of suppositories. In addition suppositories may be used in connection with colon cancer. The dendrimer conjugates also may be formulated as inhalants for the treatment of lung cancer and such like.

Although a mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention and the present invention is not limited to any particular mechanism in some embodiments a mechanism as shown below is utilized in a conjugate of the present invention 

Thus in some embodiments the present invention provides synthesis of dendrimer conjugates utilizing cyclization linkers e.g. designed as esterase cleavage substrates as shown below 

Experiments were conducted during development of embodiments of the invention in order to characterize release of drug from a dendrimer conjugate comprising a linker drug component. The linker drug components were characterized under esterase incubation conditions utilizing HPLC as an analytical tool to monitor drug release. This approach provides an assessment regarding structural influences of the linkers. For example characteristics of drug release from a linker e.g. in the absence of a dendrimer provides information regarding drug release from a linker conjugated to a dendrimer.

When incubated with pig liver esterase for 2 hours conjugate B showed minimal release and conjugate A showed 11 release. Furthermore conjugate A showed around 40 release at 24 h See e.g. .

Characterization of linkers as described in Example 6 indicated that steric hindrance issues were inhibiting release of a therapeutic from the conjugates e.g. due in some embodiments to inaccessibility of esterase to the linker .

For the synthesis of the locking module tetrahydropyridinium 3 3 carboxypropyl amino carbonyl 1 methyl aminobutyric acid GABA benzyl ester is linked to an interconvertible tetrahydronicotinamide quaternary nicotinamide salt structure that is able to participate in a re dox type reaction. The tetrahydronicotinamides are lipophilic stable compounds that readily oxidize back to precursor quaternary salts by oxidase and peroxidase enzymes in vivo. The synthesis of this compound is performed according to a modified literature procedure see e.g. Carelli V. et al. Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2003. 13 21 p. 3765 3769 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety Scheme 4 . Reaction of the GABA ester with nicotinoyl chloride gives the corresponding nicotinamide derivative. The deprotection of the benzyl ester by hydrogenation using Pd C catalyst yields the GABA derivative that is transformed to a quaternary salt by treatment with dimethyl sulfate. The pyridinium salt is reduced with NaSOor electrochemically to give a tetrahydronicotinamide derivative. This compound is conjugated in varying ratios to partially acetylated dendrimer using carbodimide coupling to give the desired locking function to the dendrimer conjugate.

Prodrug approaches have been applied to Morphine in many studies in order to improve solubility absorption tissue selectivity and other drug delivery properties. Generally either or both 3 and 6 hydroxyl groups are converted to an ester see e.g. Christrup L. L. et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 1997. 154 2 p. 157 165 Drustrup J. et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 1991. 71 1 2 p. 105 116 Groth L. et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 1997. 154 2 p. 149 155 Mignat C. et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 1996. 85 7 p. 690 694 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . The kinetics of ester enzymatic hydrolysis have been studied well. The present invention provides dendrimer conjugates wherein ester prodrugs are attached to a dendrimer platform that possesses CNS targeting characteristics. Since the structural features of the ester significantly affect the rate of hydrolysis three different ester linkages between Morphine and the dendrimer are provided. Serum esterase catalyzed drug release reactions are carried out to find the desired hydrolysis profile.

Morphine linker A a 3 Aliphatic Acid Ester See e.g. Daniels T. R. et al. Clinical Immunology 2006. 121 2 p. 159 176 Daniels T. R. et al. Clinical Immunology 2006. 121 2 p. 144 158 Carelli V. et al. Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2003. 13 21 p. 3765 3769 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Synthesis of the Morphine linker A is straightforward as shown in Scheme 5. Morphine hydrochloric acid salt will be reacted with glutaric anhydride in basic aqueous solution to afford the desired product.

The 3 morphine ester of the 4 N Boc benzoic acid is formed in a reaction with carbonyldiimidazole CDI in the presence of a base. The Boc group is removed by treatment with 1N HCl in ether. The free amino group is immediately reacted with glutaric anhydride to obtain the morphine linker B Scheme 6 .

Self immolative linkers have been proven to be a critical factor in the success of the widely applied tripartite prodrug approach. A 1 6 elimination linker Linker A in Scheme 7 is activated by serum esterases and used to conjugate Morphine to dendrimers. Synthesis of this linker is well documented and its reaction with morphine is carried out in methylene chloride in the presence of diisopropyl ethyl amine and 4 dimethylamino pyridine DMAP . The N Boc group is removed under mild acidic conditions and the resulting amino group reacted with glutaric anhydride to form the desired product Scheme 7 .

Each of the Morphine linker units are conjugated to the dendrimer which has already been attached with the locking module. EDC chemistry is employed to promote the amide bond formation. The conjugates are isolated and purified using ultrafiltration and HPLC techniques.

Small molecules such as folic acid see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. Biomacromolecules 2006. 7 2 p. 572 579 Majoros I. J. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2005. 48 19 p. 5892 5899 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties peptides RGD and EGF see e.g. Shukla R. et al. Chemical Communications 2005 46 p. 5739 5741 herein incpororated by reference in its entirety and Her2 antibodies see e.g. Shukla R. et al. Bioconjugate Chemistry 2006. 17 5 p. 1109 1115 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety target partially acetylated dendrimer conjugates to tumor cells expressing these antigens. Transferrin is used to cross the BBB and a small peptide Tet 1 to target neurons in the CNS. Transferrin has been utilized as a targeting vector to transport a drugs liposomes and proteins across the BBB by receptor mediated transcytosis see e.g. Smith M. W. and M. Gumbleton Journal of Drug Targeting 2006. 14 4 p. 191 214 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Fluorescein conjugated synthetic Tet1 peptide binds strongly to cultured PC 12 primary motor neurons and dorsal root ganglion DRG cells. Tet1 peptide also binds and internalizes in DRG and motor neurons but not muscles in tissue sections. As such Tet1 can be used to target neurons once the complex reaches the CNS.

Transferrin is conjugated to the dendrimer in two steps as described in the literature see e.g. Smith M. W. and M. Gumbleton Journal of Drug Targeting 2006. 14 4 p. 191 214 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . First a thiol reactive maleimide group is introduced on the dendrimer by reacting with sulfo SMCC at room temperature for 2 h. The dendrimer conjugate is purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G 25 column and subsequent dialysis. Next sulfhydryl groups are introduced using Traut s reagent. Briefly a cold solution of human holotransferrin in PBS EDTA buffer pH 7.4 is mixed with iminothiolane and allowed to react for 1 h. The modified transferrin is purified by eluting the mixture on a PD 10 column using PBS EDTA buffer. The degree of thiol modification is determined using Ellman assay. The maleimide derivatized dendrimer is reacted with thiol modified transferrin Tf SH for 2 h. to give a stable thioether bond. The reaction is stopped by quenching unreacted thiol groups with N ethylmaleimide. The final conjugate is purified by ultrafiltration MWCO 100 000 and analyzed by HPLC PAGE and UV vis spectroscopy.

Multiple peptide ligands on the dendrimer allow for polyvalent interactions between the ligands and cell surface targeting molecules in a way that provides a much stronger interaction than what is achieved with a single peptide interaction. Recently a linear peptide Tet 1 HLNILSTLWKYR SEQ ID NO 1 with the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin was identified by using phage display. Tet1 is used for targeted delivery of the narcotic analgesic antagonist to the CNS. The peptide is synthesized with a terminal sulphydral linker. This peptide SH molecule is conjugated to the dendrimer using standard protocols and the conjugate is purified by dialysis or gel filtration to remove excess reagents. PAGE and other analytical techniques are employed to determine the extent of peptide conjugation in the product.

The narcotic analgesic Morphine is conjugated to the dendrimer using different esterase sensitive linkers. Morphine linker compounds can be conjugated to the dendrimer in two reaction steps. First an active ester of the drug linker is prepared using EDC in a DMF DMSO solvent mixture in the presence of HOBt. This active ester solution is then be added to the aqueous solution of the dendrimer modified with a targeting and locking function. The reaction mixture is allowed to react for 24 h. Scheme 8 . The final conjugate is purified using ultrafiltration and characterized.

Naloxone indoquinone Linker see e.g. Naylor M. A. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1997. 40 15 p. 2335 2346 Zhang Z. et al. Organic Biomolecular Chemistry 2005. 3 10 p. 1905 1910 .

Synthesis of the indoquinone Naloxone linker involves multiple steps. Starting from 2 methyl 5 methoxyindole alkylation on nitrogen with sodium hydride and t butyl 4 bromobutanoate followed by formylation provides the 3 formyl indole. After the nitration reaction the 4 NOgroup is reduced to the amino group. Treatment with Fremy s salt produces the indoquinone structure. The 3 formyl group is reduced and converted to 4 NO phenyl carbonate compound A. Morphine is converted to the carbamate compound B through an activated carbonate intermediate. Compounds A and B are combined in the presence of an amine in DMF to provide the completed drug linker unit after an acid catalyzed t butyl ester hydrolysis Scheme 9 .

A nitroimidazole template is used as a reductive drug releasing system to couple Naloxone. The one position on the drug is alkylated with t butyl 4 bromobutanoate and the 2 hydroxymethyl group is introduced by a reaction with para formaldehyde. After conversion of the hydroxyl group to an activated carbonate it is coupled with a dendrimer previously mentioned compound B see Scheme 9 in the presence of a base. The t butyl ester is removed to yield the Naloxone linker unit that is ready to be conjugated to the dendrimer carrier Scheme 10 .

The tripartite prodrug strategy has been well studied and successfully applied to numerous drug delivery systems especially in targeted cancer therapeutics see e.g. de Groot F. M. H. E. W. P. Damen and H. W. Scheeren Curr. Med. Chem. Anti Cancer Agents 2001. 8 p. 1093 1122 Dubowchik G. M. and M. A. Walker Pharmacology Therapeutics 1999. 83 p. 67 123 Papot S. et al. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti Cancer Agents 2002. 2 p. 155 185 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . The general principle of drug release is shown in the following simplified scheme. Namely a trigger unit is attached to a hetero atom such as an oxygen or nitrogen on a unique linker which is in turn attached to the drug of interest through a carbonate or a carbamate linkage. Once the trigger is recognized and cleaved by an enzyme in the body the linker spontaneously decomposes to lead a facile liberation of the drug. This strategy has been proven to be effective as a powerful delivery system for various hydroxyl and amino group containing drug X 0 NH . In Scheme 11 an 1 6 elimination linker is used for illustration purposes although many other types are available to accomplish the similar goals of drug release see e.g. de Groot F. M. H. et al.

As shown in Scheme 11 the dendrimer conjugates takes advantage of the serum esterase see e.g. Antczak C. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001. 9 p. 2843 2848 Pohl T. and H. Waldmann J. Am. Chem.

Ed. 1998. 37 p. 1143 1146 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties to activate the trigger unit in the prodrug constructs. Furthermore the prodrug construct is conjugated to the unique dendrimer platform as a drug delivery carrier.

Typical 1 6 elimination linkers are used that can be activated by serum esterase. Since the rate of the ester bond cleavage can be significantly affected by the structural features at the acid side the pivalate see e.g. Antczak C. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001. 9 p. 2843 2848 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and phenylacetate see e.g. Pohl T. and H. Waldmann J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997. 119 p. 6702 6710 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety are used as the first set of templates to test the rate of drug release. Further Structure Activity Relationship SAR studies on the linkers is carried out in order to achieve the optimal drug releasing profile.

As shown in Scheme 12 therapeutics are attached to the linker with R t Bu. The 5 formylsalicyclic acid is coupled with mono Boc ethylenediamine under an EDC catalyzed condition in DMF. The crude product is treated with an acyl chloride 2 eq and triethyl amine 2.5 eq simultaneously. After isolation and purification by silica gel chromatography the product is reduced by boran in THF. The benzyl alcohol product is treated with p nitrobenzyl chloroformate in the presence of pyridine and 4 dimethylamino pyridine DMAP . The product is isolated and purified by silica gel chromatography.

The drugs for this study Ketamine and Lorazepam will be attached to the above mentioned linkers through a displacement reaction of the 4 nitrophenol group to form a carbamate linkage Ketamine see e.g. Leung L. Y. and T. A. Baillie J. Med. Chem. 1986. 29 p. 2396 2399 Woolf T. et al. J. Org.

The partially acetylated G5 dendrimer is further modified to have carboxylic acid at the terminal of each branch. This is achieved by reacting the partially acetylated G5 dendrimer with large excess of glutaric anhydride. The t Boc protecting group on the drug linker unit is removed by treatment with 1 equivalent of 1N HCl in ether. The freed amino group is immediately conjugated with the appropriately functionalized dendrimer through an EDC catalyzed coupling reaction as shown in Scheme 14 

Doxapram Scheme 3 used for reversal of respiratory depression that is induced by Ketamine Lorazapram treatment cannot be covalently conjugated onto dendrimer surface amines due to its structural characteristics. An alternative approach is to formulate Doxapram as a dendrimer complex for acid triggered release. Dendrimer drug complexes are formed through for example hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions electrostatic interactions or a combination of these approaches see e.g. Esfand R. and D. A.

In order to prepare dendrimer Doxapram complexes that release drug during acidosis poly amidoamine PAMAM dendrimers with surface succinamic acid substitutions are synthesized to facilitate both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with Doxapram.

G5 dendrimers with different succinamic acid termini are synthesized e.g. Shi X. et al. Electrophoresis 2006. 27 9 p. 1758 1767 herein incorporated by reference in its entireties . The amine terminated G5.NHdendrimers are first acetylated in different percentages followed by reaction with succinic anhydride to transfer the remaining amine groups to carboxylic acid groups Scheme 15 . The acetylation reaction see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. Macromolecules 2003. 36 p. 5526 5529 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety involves addition of 0.5 mL of pyridine to a 10 mL methanol solution containing 100 mg G5.NHdendrimer. Methanolic solutions 10 mL of acetic anhydride with different calculated molar ratios 25 50 75 and 100 of the total primary amines of G5.NH are added in parallel into the dendrimer pyridine mixture solutions while vigorously stirring and the mixture are allowed to react for 24 h. Methanol is then removed from the reaction mixture with a rotary evaporator. The oily crude product is diluted with HO and dialyzed against water 6 4 liters for three days to remove the excess of reactants and byproducts. Water is removed from the retentate and the product is re dissolved in water then lyophilized. The final G5 acetamides are annotated by using their theoretical composition numbers as G5.25Ac G5.50Ac G5.75Ac and G5.100Ac. For the carboxylation reaction 50 mg dry polycationic G5 acetamide derivative acetylation percentages 0 25 50 and 75 is dissolved in 10 mL DMSO. Into each of the G5 acetamide solution is added under vigorous stirring 10 mL of DMSO solution containing succinic anhydride with 2 3 times molar excess of the remaining primary amine groups of the particular G5 acetamide. The reaction is maintained at room temperature for 24 h. Then the final DMSO solution is dialyzed against water 6 4 liters to remove the excess succinic anhydride as well as the organic solvent. The aqueous retentate is filtered and lyophilized. The final G5 succinamic acids are denoted as G5.25SAH G5.50SAH G5.75SAH and G5.100SAH. The synthesized dendrimer acetamides and succinamic acids are characterized using high performance liquid chromatography HPLC gel permeation chromatography GPC matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight MALDI TOF mass spectrometry capillary electrophoresis CE and NMR see e.g. Shi X. et al.

Dendrimer Doxapram complexes are prepared see e.g. Kolhe P. et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 2003. 259 p. 143 160 Morgan M. T. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003. 125 50 p. 15485 15489 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . 27 mg 8.2 10mol of the G5.25SAH dendrimer molecular weight is estimated from previous publication Mw 32 910 is dissolved in 2.0 mL of CHOH. Doxapram hydrochloride Mw 0.34 mg 8.2 10mol is added to the CHOH solution and stirred for 10 min. HO 1.0 mL is added to the solution and the solution is stirred for 1 h. Next the CHOH is removed via evaporation over several hours. The encapsulated drug dendrimer solution is then be stored at room temperature until further use. Samples for NMR analysis are prepared using deuterated solvents. The amount of Doxapram complexed with G5 dendrimer succinamic acids is determined using UV Vis spectroscopy. The maximum loading capacity of Doxapram in G5 succinamic acids with different percentages of carboxyl modification is determined. Additional methods for characterization of the complexes include NMR techniques zeta potential and FTIR spectroscopy.

Binding of Morphine to a cell surface receptor initiates a series of signal transduction events which lead to cellular responses. An early event in the signal transduction pathway is the activation of Gi Go proteins leading to the inhibition of adenlyate cyclase activity and decrease in the cellular cAMP levels see e.g. Childers S. R. and S. R. Childers . Life Sciences 1991. 48 21 p. 1991 2003 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The biological functionality of the dendrimer opioid conjugates can be determined by i monitoring the in vitro binding of the conjugate onto live cells or isolated cell membranes ii determining the activation inactivation of G proteins in isolated membranes and iii quantifying the cAMP content in intact cells.

The rate limiting step in the activation of G protein is the dissociation of bound GDP which enables the binding of GTP at the displaced site. This is followed by the dissociation of G protein subunits that facilitates the activation of adenlyate cyclase and the subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP by the inherent GTPase of the G protein see e.g. Pierce K. L. et al. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 2002. 3 9 p. 639 50 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The activity of an opioid agonist can be determined in cell free systems using partially purified membrane from opioid receptor expressing cells that contains the G proteins. This is done by measuring the rate of agonist stimulated membrane binding of a non hydrolyzable analog of GTP such as the GTP S see e.g. Traynor J. R. et al. Journal of Pharmacology Experimental Therapeutics 2002. 300 1 p. 157 61 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety or by monitoring the membrane GTPase activity see e.g. Sun H. et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 1995. 92 6 p. 2229 33 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The biochemical functionality of dendrimer opioid conjugates is determined before and after pre treatment with purified esterase by G protein based assays.

A procedure similar to that described by Traynor et al is used see e.g. Traynor J. R. et al. Journal of Pharmacology Experimental Therapeutics 2002. 300 1 p. 157 61 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Cells are rinsed with PBS and scraped into Tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.3 M sucrose in presence of protease inhibitors and homogenized in a dounce homogenizer. The nuclei and unbroken cells are removed by low speed centrifugation at 200 g and the supernatant is spun again at 15 000 g for 20 min. The membrane preparation obtained is washed with Tris HCl buffer and used for binding studies. The protein concentration of the membrane is determined using standard protocols. 100 g of the partially purified membrane preparation is incubated for 10 min at 37 C. in a buffer containing S GTP S and GDP. The dendrimer opioid agonist conjugate is then added and at different time points aliquots of the reaction mixture removed and rapidly filtered through a glass fiber filter. The filters are rinsed and the bound radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Non specific binding is determined in presence of excess 50 M non radioactive GTP S. The rate constants and maximal binding of the S GTP S is determined using the GraphPad Prism program GraphPad San Diego Calif. . Appropriate controls are run in the absence of ligands and in the presence of free agonists. The effect of dendrimer opioid antagonist on the agonist induced binding is then verified.

The results of the studies described above indicate if the intact dendrimer opioid conjugates have any in vitro biological activity. The S GTP S binding studies using dendrimer Morphine conjugate that had been pre incubated with purified esterase are performed to demonstrate the biological activity of the ligand that is released by esterase. For this the conjugate is incubated with commercially available esterase for different time periods and adding ice cold buffer will stop the esterase action. The reaction mixture is immediately filtered through a 10 kDa filter at 4 C. and the filtrate used as the ligand in the S GTP S binding assay. Similarly the filtrates obtained following hypoxic treatment of dendrimer Naloxone conjugates are used to test whether the released free Naloxone inhibits agonist induced Gi protein activation.

GTPase activity is determined see e.g. Sun H. et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 1995. 92 6 p. 2229 33 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Cell membranes are partially purified. 10 to 100 g of the membrane protein are incubated in HEPES buffer pH 8.0 containing dithiothrietol and different concentrations of the dendrimer opioid agonist. The reaction is initiated by adding 100 nM GTP P and aliquots withdrawn at different time intervals into tubes containing ice cold 5 Norit A in phosphate buffer. After centrifugation of the mixture the radioactivity of the liberated P phosphate in the supernatant is quantified by scintillation counting. The binding constants are determined. Appropriate controls are run in parallel and the effect of dendrimer opioid antagonists and esterase and hypoxia treated conjugates are also be determined. If needed the specificity for Gi protein activation is verified by using membranes isolated from cells that had been pre treated with pertussis toxin 200 ng ml for 24 hrs a treatment that inactivates the GTPase activity of the Gi protein.

Dendrimer conjugates with either Morphine or Naloxone and in combination are tested in vitro on opioid responsive neuronal cell lines. Opiate Morphine binds to the mu opioid receptor MOR also known as the enkephalin G protein coupled receptor on the subsynaptic membrane of neurons involved in the transmission of pain signals. By binding to the enkephalin receptor Morphine enhances the analgesic effects of enkephalin neurons. Opiate antagonists such as Naloxone bind to mu receptors but do not activate them and prevent the binding of opiates. Morphine s relative efficacy to promote MOR internalization is much less than its relative efficacy to activate a G protein associated with the cytoplasmic C terminal of the receptor see e.g. Borgland S. L. et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry 2003. 278 21 p. 18776 84 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Morphine binding to a receptor triggers an allosteric change in the Ga subunit of the G protein causing replacement of GDP with GTP and activation of the Ga subunit. Activated Ga in turn activates an effector molecule cyclase an enzyme in the inner side of the plasma membrane and this enzyme then catalyzes the conversion of ATP into the second messenger cyclic AMP cAMP . Changes in the activity of Morphine and antagonism by Naloxone of intracellular generation of cAMP will be used as a marker of the function of dendrimer conjugated and released opioids. Responsive neuronal cells in vitro are measured by cyclase ELISA see e.g. Horton J. K. et al. Journal of Immunological Methods 1992. 155 1 p. 31 40 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

PAMAM dendrimers conjugated and or complexed to drugs such as Ketamine Lorazepam Doxapram Morphine and Naloxone are characterized. Methods for characterizing such conjugates have been developed see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al. Biomacromolecules 2006. 7 2 p. 572 579 Majoros I. J. et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2005. 48 19 p. 5892 5899 Shi X. et al. Electrophoresis 2006. 27 9 p. 1758 1767 Islam M. T. I. J. Majoros and J. R.

High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC Size Exclusion Chromatography SEC Capillary electrophoresis CE and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of flight MALDI TOF mass spectrometric techniques are utilized.

HPLC is a widely accepted analytical method for separation and purification of various compounds. PAMAM dendrimer and its conjugates have been successfully characterized and analyzed using a gradient HPLC elution see e.g. Islam M. T. I. J. Majoros and J. R. Baker Journal of Chromatography B Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences 2005. 822 1 2 p. 21 26 Islam M. T. et al. Analytical Chemistry 2005. 77 7 p. 2063 2070 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Briefly HPLC analysis is carried out on a Waters Delta 600 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector a Waters 717 Plus auto sampler and Waters Fraction collector III. The instrument is controlled by Empower 2 software. For analysis of the conjugates a C5 silica based RP HPLC column 250 4.6 mm 300 connected to a C5 guard column 4 3 mm is used. The mobile phase for elution of different generations of PAMAM dendrimers is a linear gradient beginning with 100 0 v v water acetonitrile ACN at a flow rate of 1 mL min. Trifluoroacetic acid TFA at 0.14 wt concentration in water as well as in ACN is used as a counter ion to make the dendrimer surfaces hydrophobic.

An Agilent Technologies CE instrument is used for this work. A procedure similar to as described by Shi et. al. see e.g. Shi X. Y. et al. Electrophoresis 2005. 26 15 p. 2949 2959 Shi X. Y. et al. Analyst 2006. 131 3 p. 374 381 Shi X. Y. et al. Electrophoresis 2005. 26 15 p. 2960 2967 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties is used to characterize dendrimer conjugates. Samples are introduced by hydrodynamic injection. Detection is done by an online PDA detector installed in the system.

SEC experiments for dendrimers and their conjugates are performed using an Alliance Waters 2690 2695 separations module Waters Corp. Milford Mass. equipped with a Waters 2487 UV absorbance detector Waters Corp. a Wyatt Dawn DSP laser photometer Wyatt Technology Corp.

Citric acid buffer 0.1 M concentration with 0.025 sodium azide in water is used as a mobile phase pH 2.74 using NaOH. Molar mass moments of the PAMAM dendrimers is determined using Astra software version 4.9 Wyatt Technology Corp. .

MALDI TOF mass spectra is acquired using a Waters TofSpec 2E spectrometer in a reflection mode. Each sample is dissolved in 50 50 mixture of methanol water to obtain an approximate concentration of 0.25 mg mL. The samples is then mixed with equal volumes 5 L of the matrix solution 10 mg mL R cyano 4 hydroxycinnamic acid CHCA dissolved in ACN ethanol 50 50 . The TFA salt form of the separated samples is isolated and collected. A 1 L solution of the mixture is injected on the spots of the target plate and evaporated to dryness. Calibration of the spectrometer is done using a mixture of known peptides in the CHCA matrix.

HPLC is widely used in the pharmaceutical field to analyze a variety of drugs. Ketamine Lorazepam and Morphine have been extensively characterized using HPLC see e.g. Kuracka L. et al. Clinical Chemistry 1996. 42 5 p. 756 760 Orlovic D. et al. Chromatographia 2000. 52 11 12 p. 732 734 Svensson J. et al. Journal of Chromatography B Biomedical Sciences and Applications 1982. 230 2 p. 427 432 Svensson J. O. Journal of Chromatography B Biomedical Sciences and Applications 1986. 375 p. 174 178 Tebbett I. R. Chromatographia 1987. 23 5 p. 377 378 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . These drugs are conjugated to the dendrimer scaffold using an ester linkage. The drugs are released from the carrier molecule into the biological matrix after cleavage by cellular esterase tested both as purified enzyme and cellular extract. HPLC is used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze free drug content in the biological medium after its release . Quantitative analysis is done by a calibration curve method generated by a standard sample of the free drugs.

To study drug release using HPLC the drug conjugated to the dendrimer scaffold is incubated with serum at 37 C. in a heparinized tube for 72 hrs. Once the drug is released from the scaffold by the esterase aliquots at various time points are collected and frozen until HPLC analysis. Prior to HPLC analysis for free drug content the serum sample and cerebrospinal fluid with and without drug conjugate are pre treated using the Solid Phase Extraction method carried out by using CSep pak cartridges to remove any interfering matrix impurities. After pre treatment the samples are reconstituted with the HPLC eluent and injected into a reverse phase column.

For quantitative analysis standard drug samples are obtained and stock solutions for each of these drugs are made in an appropriate solvent. Using a serial dilution method standards for each drug at various concentrations are prepared to generate a calibration curve. Concentration of free drug after its release is calculated using a regression equation. Simultaneous analysis of Ketamine and Lorazepam are carried out by preparing a sample containing both drugs. This is then analyzed under the specified HPLC conditions.

Recovery of the Sample see e.g. Kuracka L. et al. Clinical Chemistry 1996. 42 5 p. 756 760 Kimiskidis V. et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis in press each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties 

An important step for HPLC analysis of the drug in biological medium is its extraction. The percent recovery of the sample by an extraction process is crucial. To check for the percent recovery of a drug sample from the biological medium a standard drug sample of a known concentration is spiked into serum and or cerebrospinal fluid. This spiked sample is then subjected to sample pre treatment. An HPLC analysis is performed on the pre treated spiked sample and a standard drug sample. From the calibration curve and the regression equation the percent recovery is computed.

The synthetic approach for Doxapram involves formation of a complex with the dendrimer which releases the drug on lower pH pH trigger . Doxapram release from the dendrimer is studied in complexes formed with different ratios of dendrimer and drug and with different dendrimers with varied amounts of succinamide substitution. The dendrimer drug complex is subjected to dialysis against various buffer systems pH ranging from 7.4 to 6.8 and the dialysate subjected to HPLC analysis to determine drug release and release kinetics. Ultrafiltration of complexes mixed with serum buffered to different pH is also employed to determine the exact drug release at varied serum pH.

Concentrated sample of the dendrimer Doxapram complex is prepared in saline. 500 L of this solution is then placed in a dialysis tube MWCO 10 KD . This sample is dialyzed against buffers of various pH ranging from 6.8 to 7.4. The volume of the buffers in the outer phase is 100 mL. Permeates at various time points are withdrawn from the outer phase and centrifuged against a molecular weight cut off filter to remove buffers and to concentrate the sample. The retentate is reconstituted with the eluent and subjected to analysis using HPLC. A series of Doxapram standards are prepared in an appropriate solvent using a serial dilution to generate a calibration curve. Quantitative analysis for the amount of drug release is computed using a regression equation. In an alternative approach to mimic physiological conditions Doxapram release is studied in serum.

Release of Naloxone is triggered by hypoxia induction due to exceeding limits of Morphine dosage. An in vitro hypoxia model that facilitates drug release is used for naloxone release. An in vitro hypoxia model for measuring a neurotransmitter Dopamine release is used see e.g. Stamford J. A. Journal of Neuroscience Methods 1990. 34 1 3 p. 67 72 Toner C. C. and J. A. Stamford Journal of Neuroscience Methods 1996. 67 2 p. 133 140 Toner C. C. and J. A. Stamford Neuroscience 1997. 81 4 p. 999 1007 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . A quantitative method for determination of drug content in artificial CSF ACSF using HPLC see e.g. Kimiskidis V. et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis in press herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Also Naloxone has been thoroughly characterized and analyzed using HPLC see e.g. Achilli G. et al. Journal of Chromatography A 1996. 729 1 2 p. 273 277 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Accordingly an in vitro model using HPLC to study the CSF release kinetics of Naloxone under hypoxic conditions is provided.

An in vitro hypoxia model is provided. The sample vials are placed in an enclosed chamber that has the capability to continuously allow the flow of required gases and alternatively facilitates ease of sampling. The amount of gas that pumped into this chamber is maintained and controlled through a peristaltic pump. The temperature of the system is maintained at 37 C. Using this set up the sample vials containing dendrimer drug conjugate in CSF are incubated in this enclosed chamber. Varying concentrations of human DT diaphorase Sigma the brain enzyme responsible for the bioreduction catalysis of the indolequinone Naloxone conjugate that is regulated by hypoxia are provided. Initially hypoxia is induced by gassing the chamber with 95 N 5 COgas for about 30 minutes at 400 ml hr see e.g. Toner C. C. and J. A. Stamford Neuroscience 1997. 81 4 p. 999 1007 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Simultaneously another sample vial is oxygenated by flowing 95 O 5 COthat serves as a control. After sample incubation under hypoxic condition aliquots from each sample oxygenated and deoxygenated are taken and stored until analysis. For sample incubated under hypoxic conditions storage of the aliquots sample pre treatment and sample preparation are carried out in a glove box to maintain hypoxic conditions. HPLC of these samples is then carried out to check for free drug content.

The sample is incubated under 95 N 5 COatmosphere for different time periods and aliquots are collected at the end of each incubation time period to study the amount of drug release. Also the rate of gassing the amount of gas passing through the chamber is critical. To optimize these conditions the chamber is gassed at various speeds and at the end of each run the aliquots are taken for analysis using HPLC. Once the conditions for hypoxia induced drug release are optimized the samples in CSF are subjected to the set conditions to characterize the kinetics of drug release. The samples are pre treated prior to HPLC analysis. Complete quantitative analysis using standard samples of Naloxone is carried out in a similar fashion.

The complete qualitative and quantitative analysis using HPLC is carried out on a Waters Delta 600 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector a Waters 717 Plus auto sampler Waters Fraction collector III and Empower 2 software. An analytical size column C8 or C18 with a particle size of 5 is used. Initially an isocratic elution using acetonitrile phosphate buffer pH 7.0 is used. The conditions for an HPLC experiment if required are modified in order to incorporate various analyses and generate efficient results.

Synthesized analgesic nanodevices should be stable and biologically inactive. The biological activity or lack thereof is tested using the radio ligand competition binding assay. If no binding competition is observed the nanodevices are treated to release fully functional drugs. The drugs release kinetics and biological activity is further evaluated using fluorescence polarization immunoassay FPIA analysis and the radioligand competition binding assay. This assay is used to study the ability of released drug and drug conjugates to bind to the respective receptors.

The assay is performed using membrane preparations from cell lines shown in Table 2 that express various receptors. Prior to membrane preparation the cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 heat inactivated bovine calf serum 2 mM L glutamine as well as penicillin and streptomycin. The cells are grown at 37 C. in a 5 COincubator. Cell membranes are prepared as described previously see e.g. Horner K. A. et al. Brain Research 2004. 1028 2 p. 121 32 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Total protein concentration is determined with bovine serum albumin BSA as a standard. Cell membrane binding assays for receptors are performed as described previously see e.g. Horner K. A. et al. Brain Research 2004. 1028 2 p. 121 32 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Briefly cell membranes 0.1 mg protein are incubated in 100 mM Trizma 0.3 bovine serum albumin containing a constant concentration of H drug and various concentrations of unlabeled drug either coupled to or released from the dendrimer. Nonspecific binding is defined as that measured in the presence of 1 M of cold drug.

To evaluate of kinetics of Morphine and Naloxone release from the nanodevice the fluorescence polarization immunoassay is performed as described previously see e.g. KuKanich B. et al. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring 2005. 27 3 p. 389 92 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . FPIA samples are prepared by mixing of 100 L standard solution or supernatant of drug filtered through a 10 kDa cutoff membrane to separate drug released from nanodevice. The materials are mixed with 100 L of the tracer solution in borate buffer and 300 L of optimal dilution of MAb.

Sigmoidal curves are fitted to a four parameter logistic equation.

To demonstrate that the CNS targeted dendrimer conjugate is transported across the BBB the DIV BBB system Flocel Inc. Cleveland Ohio that closely mimics the in vivo BBB is used see e.g. Cucullo L. et al. Current Opinion in Drug Discovery Development 2005. 8 1 p. 88 99 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Briefly the DIV BBB is characterized by tight junctions segregated lumenal ablumenal transporters i.e. potassium amino acids glucose GLUT 1 a negligible permeability to 14C sucrose and a high transendothelial electrical resistance TEER 1000 cm2 . The dendrimer drug conjugate is dissolved in saline and injected through the luminal side of the DIV BBB cartridge. The conjugate is allowed to pass through the endothelial capillaries EC to the ablumenal side. The samples are then be collected from the ablumenal side at various time intervals and analyzed for the presence of conjugate using HPLC.

Dendrimers with varying degrees of substitution with the tetrahydronicotinamide derivative are exposed to horseradish peroxidase enzymes Sigma in varying buffers neuronal cell lines enzyme and protein concentrations to simulate the CNS environment. MS and proton NMR determine the amount of charged material on the dendrimer. This material is tested for the ability to cross the BBB. Transport before and after treatment is compared as is activity with different levels of conjugate to determine an optimal degree of conjugation to develop inducible locking activity.

The ability of transferrin and Tet1 dendrimer conjugates to bind to neurons is evaluated using several techniques. Neuronal cell lines SH SY5Y SK N SH T47D see Table 2 above are cultured and incubated with radio labeled transferrin and Tet1 dendrimer conjugates. Cells are washed and the cell pellets collected and assayed for bound radioactivity. Non labeled transferrin and tet peptides are employed in an effort to block binding. Conjugates having both drug and targeting ligand are employed to determine if there is cooperative binding. Alternatively the dendrimer conjugates are labeled with fluorescein and the binding and uptake in the neuronal cells tested using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al.

These techniques allow for rapid dose ranging studies.

Morphine and Naloxone were first modified to form pro drugs through the attachment of rationally designed chemical modifications and . The modifications used for the Morphine pro drugs were designed to be progressively and consistently cleaved by the esterases present in plasma while those used in the formation of the Naloxone pro drugs were cleaved to yield active drug by reduction only under hypoxic conditions therefore serving as the feedback mechanism. Structural variations in the linkers resulted in variations in the rate of the continuous release of Morphine and the hypoxia activated release of Naloxone. Both sets of pro drugs were then associated with G5 PAMAM dendrimers to form a delivery platform through either i non covalent complexation with the polymer or ii covalent conjugation to the dendrimer. A schematic illustrating the family of resulting formulations is in vivo displayed in .

Based on this release study it was determined that 78 mg of the indolequinone linker based Naloxone pro drug are required to achieve a release of 6 mg Naloxone hour.

In order to provide effective narcotic Morphine Hydromorphone analgesia over prolonged periods scale up synthesis processes for the compounds are developed. Three 3 grams of each compound are synthesized. These compounds are used in combination to obtain the desired release kinetics of the analgesic and narcotic antagonist.

All of the Morphine pro drugs A B C D E F G see were synthesized through conventional organic chemistry . Yields for each step were moderate to excellent. To minimize the number of permeatations four of the six Morphine pro drugs synthesized are selected for scale up. Given the increased potency of Hydromorphone as compared to Morphine two esterase s7ensitive Hydromorphone pro drugs are sythesized on gram scales.

The synthesis of indolequinone linker based Naloxone pro drugs was achieved on the 10 20 mg scale. Although 8 indolequinone based Naloxone pro drugs were originally synthesized only the 4 pro drugs containing diamine spacers were shown to be stable in PBS buffer. Therefore only these 4 pro drugs are scaled up to gram quantities . The final indolequinone Naloxone products are further purified by preparation TLC 0.25 mm thick 20 20 cm Whatman .

An advantage of using dendrimer drug complexes for drug delivery applications is generally known 1 to make water insoluble drugs water soluble and 2 to achieve high drug loading capacity. The hydrophobic interior of dendrimers along with their unique surface functional groups allow for effective complexation of drugs . The mechanism to form dendrimer drug complexes is based on the hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding Van der Waals force and or the combination thereof see e.g. Esfand R. and D. A. Tomalia Drug Discovery Today 2001. 6 p. 427 436 Kolhe P. et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 2003. 259 p. 143 160 Morgan M. T. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003. 125 50 p. 15485 15489 Papagiannaros A. et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 2005. 302 p. 29 38 Patri A. K. J. F. Kukowska Latallo and J. R. Baker Jr. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 2005. 57 p. 2203 2214 Shcharbin D. and B. M. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 2006. 1760 p. 1021 1026 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In experiments conducted during the course of the present invention it was shown that Morphine and Naloxone pro drugs can be complexed with G5 dendrimers with very high payload 40 70 pro drug molecules per dendrimer molecule . The novel concept to use dendrimer pro drug complexes allows one to design desired bimodal release profiles of drugs through different mechanisms. For example a dendrimer Morphine pro drug complex can be first released through a general diffusion driven mechanism followed by the cleavage of the ester bond of the pro drugs to release Morphine drug.

To obtain gram scales of the Morphine Hydromorphone or Naloxone pro drug complexes a G5 dendrimer with 80 amine groups acetylated and the remaining amines carboxylated G5.NHAc80 SAH is used for complexation. G5.NHAc SAH dendrimer 1.0 g is dissolved in 50 mL water and a specific pro drug molar ratio of dendrimer pro drug 1 80 dissolved into 5 mL methanol. The two solutions are mixed together and magnetically stirred over night to allow the evaporation of methanol. Then the solution is centrifuged to remove possible precipitates related to non complexed Morphine or Naloxone pro drugs as the pro drugs are hydrophobic and insoluble in water. The precipitate is collected and dissolved into methanol for HPLC analysis. The supernatant is lyophilized. The loading capacity of drugs is determined using HPLC. The final complexes are characterized using NMR zeta potential measurements and light scattering.

In experiments conducted during the course of the present invention several dendrimer pro drug conjugates were synthesized. The pro drugs containing acid amine or azide functional groups were reacted with carboxyl amine hydroxyl or alkyne surface modified dendrimers respectively to afford the desired dendrimer drug compounds . A similar strategy is utilized to scale up these compounds 100 mg 1 g .

In experiments conducted during the course of the present invention it was shown that the synthesis of folic acid targeted dendrimer drug conjugates can be scaled up to 100 g without any significant purification problems. A G5 PAMAM dendrimer is used as a general platform. G5 PAMAM dendrimer is first partially acetylated using a calculated amount acetic anhydride in presence of triethylamine as base. The remaining amino groups of the dendrimer are further modified to have either carboxylic acid or alkyne groups at the terminus of each branch. The carboxyl surface modification is achieved by reaction of the partially acetylated G5 dendrimer with a large excess of succinic glutaric anhydride in methanol. The partially acetylated G5 dendrimer is reacted with 3 4 ethynyloxy phenyl propanoic acid to give alkyne functionalized partially acetylated dendrimer. Pro drugs containing a carboxyl functional group are reacted with partially acetylated dendrimer to provide amide linked dendrimer drug conjugate. The carboxyl surface modified dendrimer is attached to the pro drugs having amine functional groups using standard carbodiimide coupling reaction. In experiments conducted during the course of the present invention a method was developed for reacting azide functionalized drug linkers with alkyne terminated dendrimers using Cu I as catalyst. All these conjugate syntheses are readily scaled up to gram quantities using a variety of coupling conditions. The synthesized conjugates are purified by gel filtration large scale ultrafiltration using membranes of large surface area and dialysis and characterized using NMR mass spectroscopy and UV vis.

In experiments conducted during the course of the present invention successful methods were developed to characterize PAMAM dendrimers see e.g. Majoros I. J. et al.

High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC Size Exclusion Chromatography SEC Capillary electrophoresis CE and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of flight MALDI TOF mass spectrometric techniques are utilized.

HPLC is a widely accepted analytical method for separation and purification of various compounds. PAMAM dendrimer and its conjugates have been successfully characterized and analyzed using a gradient HPLC elution see e.g. Islam M. T. I. J. Majoros and J. R. Baker Journal of Chromatography B Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences 2005. 822 1 2 p. 21 26 Islam M. T. et al. Analytical Chemistry 2005. 77 7 p. 2063 2070 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Briefly HPLC analysis is carried out on a Waters Delta 600 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector a Waters 717 Plus auto sampler and Waters Fraction collector III. The instrument is controlled by Empower 2 software. For analysis of the conjugates a C5 silica based RP HPLC column 250 4.6 mm 300 connected to a C5 guard column 4 3 mm is used. The mobile phase for elution of different generations of PAMAM dendrimers is a linear gradient beginning with 100 0 v v water acetonitrile ACN at a flow rate of 1 mL min. Trifluoroacetic acid TFA at 0.14 wt concentration in water as well as in ACN are used as a counter ion to make the dendrimer surfaces hydrophobic.

An Agilent Technologies CE instrument is used for capillary electrophoresis. A procedure is used to characterize dendrimer conjugates see e.g. Shi X. Y. et al. Electrophoresis 2005. 26 15 p. 2949 2959 Shi X. Y. et al. Analyst 2006. 131 3 p. 374 381 Shi X. Y. et al. Electrophoresis 2005. 26 15 p. 2960 2967 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties . Samples are introduced by hydrodynamic injection. Detection is done by an online PDA detector installed in the system.

SEC experiments for dendrimers and their conjugates are performed using an Alliance Waters 2690 2695 separations module Waters Corp. Milford Mass. equipped with a Waters 2487 UV absorbance detector Waters Corp. a Wyatt Dawn DSP laser photometer Wyatt Technology Corp. Santa Barbara Calif. an Optilab DSP interferometric refractometer Wyatt Technology Corp. and TosoHaas TSK Gel Guard PHW 06762 75 7.5 mm 12 m G 2000 PW 05761 300 7.5 mm 10 m G 3000 PW 05762 300 7.5 mm 10 m and G 4000 PW 300 7.5 mm 17 m columns. Citric acid buffer 0.1 M concentration with 0.025 sodium azide in water is used as a mobile phase pH 2.74 using NaOH. Molar mass moments of the PAMAM dendrimers are determined using Astra software version 4.9 Wyatt Technology Corp. .

MALDI TOF mass spectra is acquired using a Waters TofSpec 2E spectrometer in a reflection mode. Each sample is dissolved in a 50 50 mixture of methanol water to obtain an approximate concentration of 0.25 mg mL. The samples are then mixed with equal volumes 5 L of the matrix solution 10 mg mL R cyano 4 hydroxycinnamic acid CHCA dissolved in ACN ethanol 50 50 . The TFA salt form of the separated samples is isolated and collected. A 1 L solution of the mixture is injected on the spots of the target plate and evaporated to dryness. Calibration of the spectrometer is done using a mixture of known peptides in the CHCA matrix.

The controlled drug release is based on the premise that the synthesized pro drugs remain biologically minimally active or inactive and the free drug is released to an active form by a physiological trigger such as an esterase action or hypoxia. The biological function of the pro drugs and the released drugs by bioassays are monitored. The binding characteristics of the released drugs on appropriate cells which express the receptors for these drugs are tested. Ligands with established biochemical signal effects following their binding are studied by monitoring these signals. For example the binding of Morphine to a cell surface receptor initiates a series of signal transduction events which lead to several cellular responses. An early event in the signal transduction pathway is the activation of Gi Go proteins leading to the inhibition of adenlyate cyclase activity and decrease in the cellular cAMP levels see e.g. Childers S. R. and S. R. Childers Life Sciences 1991. 48 21 p. 1991 2003 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The biological functionality of the dendrimer opioid conjugates are determined in vitro by for example i monitoring the binding of the conjugate onto live cells or isolated cell membranes ii determining the activation inactivation of G proteins in isolated membranes and iii quantifying the cAMP content in intact cells.

This assay is performed using membrane preparations from cell lines shown in Table 3 that express various receptors.

The binding of the synthesized pro drugs and dendrimer drug compounds onto receptors of these drugs in partially purified membrane fractions of cell lines listed in Table 3 is tested. For this membrane is extracted with 0.5 Triton X in buffer containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h. The supernatant is ultra filtered to remove the detergent and other small molecules and the protein extract used as a source of receptors for drug conjugate binding. If needed the opioid receptor is further purified by affinity chromatography of the Triton X solubilized fraction. The binding of the conjugates is tested using a BIAcore X instrument BIAcore AB Uppsala Sweden see e.g. Hong S. et al. Chemistry Biology 2007. 14 1 p. 105 113 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The conditions for receptor immobilization and ligand binding is optimized using different BIAcore sensor chips and buffer solutions as suggested by the vendor. The data obtained is analyzed by a global fitting binding model using the BlAevaluation 3.2 software. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants K are calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants k k . The data obtained displays the efficacy for binding of the conjugates vs. free drugs on their respective receptors.

The rate limiting step in the activation of G protein is the dissociation of bound GDP which enables the binding of GTP at the displaced site. This is followed by the dissociation of G protein subunits that facilitates the activation of adenlyate cyclase and the subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP by the inherent GTPase of the G protein see e.g. Pierce K. L. et al. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 2002. 3 9 p. 639 50 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The activity of an opioid agonist is determined in cell free systems using partially purified membrane from opioid receptor expressing cells that contains the G proteins. This is done by measuring the rate of agonist stimulated membrane binding of a non hydrolyzable analog of GTP such as the GTP S see e.g. Traynor J. R. et al. Journal of Pharmacology Experimental Therapeutics 2002. 300 1 p. 157 61 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety or by monitoring the membrane GTPase activity see e.g. Sun H. et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 1995. 92 6 p. 2229 33 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . The biochemical functionality of dendrimer opioid conjugates before and after pre treatment with purified enzymes and plasma is determined by G protein based assays.

Cells are rinsed with PBS and scraped into 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.3 M sucrose in presence of protease inhibitors and homogenized in a dounce homogenizer. The nuclei and unbroken cells are removed by low speed centrifugation at 200 g and the supernatant is spun again at 15 000 g for 20 min. The membrane preparation obtained is washed with Tris HCl buffer and used for binding studies. The protein concentration of the membrane is determined using standard protocols. 100 g of the partially purified membrane preparation is incubated for 10 min at 37 C. in a buffer containing S GTP S and GDP. The pro drugs are then added and at different time points aliquots of the reaction mixture removed and rapidly filtered through a glass fiber filter. The filters are rinsed and the bound radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Non specific binding is determined in presence of excess 50 M non radioactive GTP S. The rate constants and maximal binding of the S GTP S is determined using the GraphPad Prism program GraphPad San Diego Calif. . Appropriate controls are run in the absence of ligands and in the presence of free agonists. The effect of the dendrimer opioid antagonist on the agonist induced binding is then be verified.

The results of the studies described above indicate if the intact pro drugs have any in vitro biological activity. The S GTP S binding studies using pro drugs that had been pre incubated with purified esterase plasma are done in order to demonstrate the biological activity of the ligand that is released by esterase. For this the conjugate complex is incubated with the enzymes for different time periods and adding ice cold buffer to stop the esterase action. The reaction mixture is immediately filtered through a 10 kDa filter at 4 C. and the filtrate used as the ligand in the S GTP S binding assay see e.g. Traynor J. R. et al. Journal of Pharmacology Experimental Therapeutics 2002. 300 1 p. 157 61 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Similarly the filtrates obtained following hypoxic treatment of dendrimer Naloxone pro drug complexes conjugates are used to test whether the released free Naloxone inhibits agonist induced Gi protein activation.

GTPase activity will be determined as previously described see e.g. Sun H. et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 1995. 92 6 p. 2229 33 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Cell membranes are partially purified. 10 to 100 g of the membrane protein are incubated in HEPES buffer pH 8.0 containing dithiothrietol and different concentrations of pro drugs. The reaction is initiated by adding 100 nM GTP P and aliquots withdrawn at different time intervals into tubes containing ice cold 5 Norit A in phosphate buffer. After centrifugation of the mixture the radioactivity of the liberated P phosphate in the supernatant is quantified by scintillation counting. The binding constants are determined. Appropriate controls are run in parallel and the effect of respiratory stimulants and esterase and hypoxia treated conjugates are also determined. If needed the specificity for Gi protein activation is verified by using membranes isolated from cells that had been pre treated with pertussis toxin 200 ng ml for 24 hrs a treatment that inactivates the GTPase activity of the Gi protein.

Dendrimer based pro drugs with either Morphine Hydromorphone or Naloxone and in combination are tested in vitro on opioid responsive neuronal cell lines. Morphine binding and G protein mediated signal transduction events leads to the activation of the enzyme adenlyate cyclase and generation of the second messenger cyclic AMP cAMP . Changes in the activity of Morphine and antagonism by Naloxone of intracellular generation of cAMP are used as a marker of the function of dendrimer conjugated and released opioids. Responsive neuronal cells are measured by cyclase ELISA see e.g. Horton J. K. et al. Journal of Immunological Methods 1992. 155 1 p. 31 40 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The cytotoxicity of the free drugs and the conjugates is determined by multiple biochemical assays such as XTT assay Clonogenic assay and lactate dehydrogenase LDH release assay using the cells lines given in Table 3. As some indolequinones have variable cytotoxic potential in the oxidized and reduced state see e.g. Newsome et al Organic Biomolecular Chemistry 5 10 1629 40 2007 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety the cytotoxicity of the compounds before and after reduction by reductases is tested.

This assay is based on the conversion of XTT sodium 3 1 phenylaminocarbonyl 3 4 tetrazolium bis 4 methoxy 6 nitro benzene sulfonic acid hydrate Roche Diagnostics to formazan by mitochondria of live cells. Cells are placed in 96 well microtiter plates and incubated with various concentrations of the drug conjugates for different time periods. The drugs are removed and the cells are allowed to recover for 3 days. The cells are incubated with XTT reagent for 2 hours and the absorbance of the formazan product formed is measured at 492 nm on ELISA reader using a reference wavelength of 690 nm.

This is based on inhibiting colony formation initiated by single cells. 100 cells are plated in 60 mm dishes and incubated drug conjugates under various conditions and allowed the singles cells to form colonies over a period of 7 10 days. Cells are rinsed and stained with methylene blue. Cell colonies 20 cells are counted using an AcuCount1000 Bio Logics counter.

This is based on the determination of cell membrane integrity and the leakage of LDH from dead cells. Cells are plated in 96 wells and exposed to drug conjugates for varying times. The conjugates are removed and incubated with a fluorogenic substrate for LDH Cyto Tox One Promega . The generated fluorescence is measured excitation 560 nm and emission 590 nm as a function of the concentration of LDH in the media.

If needed in order to differentiate between apoptosis vs. necrosis apoptosis sensing assays such as Annexin V PS staining BD Sciences and CaspaTag Caspase 3 binding Chemicon assays are conducted.

Methods were designed to evaluate the release kinetics and activity of drugs prodrugs and conjugated drugs with dendrimers. This is done to document that both the specific activity and dosage of drug achievable with these systems are adequate for the desired therapeutic and feedback effects. These studies are performed with parallel development of both the Morphine Hydromorphone and Naloxone arms with combination testing as an ongoing process. It is anticipated that a number of additional compounds will be created as well as modifications to promising candidates in order to arrive at optimal release kinetics. Ultimately utilizing a down selection process based on efficacy testing and ADMET the best compounds will be placed in a preclinical simulation providing evidence for an IND submission to the FDA.

The components of each phase possess unique requirements in animal model design and testing which have been considered to enhance our capability for success.

 a Hartley Guinea Pigs see e.g. Nambiar M. P. et al. Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 2007. 219 2 3 p. 142 150 Shih T. M. T. C. Rowland and J. H. McDonough Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 2007. 320 1 p. 154 161 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Adult male Hartley guinea pigs weighing 500 grams are an accepted model utilized by the esterase scientific community. Guinea pigs allow for initial testing of large numbers of prodrug conjugates which can be studied in an economical and effective way. In addition these animals are adequate size to be intubated under general anesthetic conditions for airway control and hypoxia induction. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is required to validate hypoxic release of Naloxone is also possible in this animal model. Animal size allows for the collection of approximately 5 ml whole blood prior to an end terminal bleed which limits the number of time points for collection of an otherwise optimal small animal model for study.

An esterase knockout mouse bred specifically to simulate in vivo human esterase conditions is provided. This model provides highly translatable data to the human condition. This model serves as a backup to guinea pig for Morphine Hydromorphone release.

A total of 12 pro drug pro drug compounds are tested at 6 dosage levels utilizing 2 delivery methods with 6 evaluation time points per animal. Three animals for each group for statistical validity are used. Blood samples are drawn at time 0 prior to drug administration and at serial time points of 10 30 60 min and 6 12 24 hours via a placed indwelling catheter. For the first 6 time points 0.5 ml are withdrawn. This is followed by an end terminal bleed for approximately 10 ml final whole blood. These samples immediately undergo analysis for Morphine Hydromorphone levels in serum using an ELISA assay. For the best 2 drugs only recovery procedures are carried out with continued blood sampling at 2 weeks and 1 month followed by sacrifice and histopathology to validate the lack of long term toxicity.

For serum Morphine Hydromorphone level determination the Calbiotech Morphine Specific Direct ELISA Kit is utilized. In 96 well plates 20 ul serum is incubated per manufacturer instructions. Both positive and negative controls are analyzed as provided in the assay. The resulting products are read utilizing a 96 well plate reader Bio Rad 680 XR Microplate Reader and analyzed using provided statistical software. The assay s reported sensitivity is to 1 ng mL which is more than adequate for the anticipated in vivo serum levels.

Guinea Pigs are anesthetized and the carotid artery accessed for placement of an invasive oxygen monitor catheter which provides direct measurement of blood oxygenation during the study. Blood is drawn as a preoperative standard and then 6 prodrug conjugates are administered using 6 different dosage schedules via 2 delivery methods. Hypoxia is then induced using a gas mixture to obtain the desired levels of Sa02 10 20 40 70 100 . Blood is collected and analyzed at each of these levels to confirm appropriate drug release at the desired hypoxic levels. These samples immediately undergo analysis for Naloxone levels using HPLC. For the best 2 drugs only recovery procedures are carried out with continued blood sampling at 2 weeks and 1 month followed by sacrifice and histopathology to validate the lack of long term toxicity.

HPLC see e.g. Kuracka L. et al. Clinical Chemistry 1996. 42 5 p. 756 760 Orlovic D. et al. Chromatographia 2000. 52 11 12 p. 732 734 Svensson J. et al.

R. Chromatographia 1987. 23 5 p. 377 378 each herein incorporated by reference in their entireties is utilized to quantitatively analyze Naloxone content in the serum samples. Prior to HPLC analysis of the reaction mixtures the samples are pre treated by protein precipitation by organic solvents. If needed Solid Phase Extraction method carried out by using CSep pak cartridges to remove proteins and any other interfering matrix impurities is also performed. After pre treatment the samples are reconstituted with the HPLC eluent and injected into a reverse phase column. The complete qualitative and quantitative analysis using HPLC is carried out on a Waters Delta 600 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector a Waters 717 Plus auto sampler Waters Fraction collector III and Empower 2 software. An analytical size column C8 or C18 with a particle size of 5 m is used. Initially an isocratic elution using acetonitrile phosphate buffer pH 7.0 is used. The conditions for an HPLC experiment if required are modified in order to incorporate various analyses and generate efficient results. To determine the percent recovery of a drug sample from the serum a standard drug sample of a known concentration is spiked into serum and or cerebrospinal fluid. This spiked sample is then subjected to sample pre treatment. A HPLC analysis is performed on this pre treated spiked sample and a standard drug sample. From the calibration curve and the regression equation the percent recovery is computed.

For quantitative analysis standard drug samples are obtained and stock solutions for each of these drugs made in an appropriate solvent. Using a serial dilution method standards for each drug at various concentrations are prepared to generate a calibration curve. Concentration of free drug after its release is calculated using a regression equation.

ADMET data has already been obtained for Morphine Hydromorphone Naloxone and the dendrimers themselves. Therefore toxicity issues from these compounds will not be a limiting factor in selection of the final compound. Analysis of the final formulations is conducted to assure that they are also not toxic. Therefore ADMET characteristics of only those compounds that show desirable release kinetics will need to be surveyed. Three adult male Hartley pigs 500 grams per compound are used to ensure statistical validity. Six dosage levels with 2 delivery methods are explored with the goal of achieving dose related toxicity in the highest group for definition of the therapeutic threshold. Morphine Hydromorphone and 2 Naloxone C radio labeled compounds will undergo ADMET testing.

An indwelling port is placed to assist with scheduled blood draws. Following drug administration blood samples are drawn at serial time points of 1 4 7 and 14 days. An end terminal bleed is completed and animals will be sacrificed with 10 organ harvest for histopathological examination to determine distribution and toxicity effects. Blood samples undergo HPLC analysis for evaluation of compound conjugate levels.

A component of developing a controlled analgesic release system is determining the mixture of Morphine Hydromorphone and Naloxone necessary obtain the desired clinical effects. Due to the fast drug release kinetics pro drugs are used for the initial loading bolus to reach the desired drug serum concentration. Pro drug dendrimer complexes and conjugates both of which have shown slower drug release kinetics are used for maintenance to replace drug lost during the distribution and elimination phases .

Gottingen pigs are 20 kg and offer a translatable model to human condition with the ability for both intubation and invasive hemodynamic monitoring as well as a large quantity of blood for analysis of drug release. Data obtained from pigs is adequate for proof of concept validation. This model allows evaluation of numerous time points both for Morphine Hydromorphone release via esterase and Naloxone release via hypoxia.

In vivo studies simultaneously examining the activity Morphine Hydromorphone and Naloxone based compounds is conducted. Due to the complex monitoring required for these studies they need to be performed in Gottingen pigs. Combinations of both Morphine Hydromorphone and Naloxone based compounds are administered to the pigs. Pigs are dosed five times 5 over a period of one hour. This is done to simulate a potential overdose scenario and therefore enable evaluation of the feedback mechanism within the controlled analgesic release system. The pigs are bled regularly for over the course of 12 hours.

Gottingen mini pigs are anesthetized and the carotid artery accessed for placement of an invasive oxygen monitor catheter which provides direct measurement of blood oxygenation during the study. Blood is drawn as a preoperative standard. Eight combinations of the best 2 drugs from each category narcotic and anti narcotic are evaluated using a clinical simulation model applicable to direct in field application. Pigs receive serial administration of the combination of drugs at time 0 15 30 45 60 min for a total of 5 doses. This simulates a potential overdose scenario and therefore enables evaluation of the feedback mechanism within the controlled analgesic release system. If hypoxia has not occurred following the final dosage a gas mixture is administered with reduced oxygen concentrations to simulate hypoxia due to analgesic overdose. Blood samples are taken at 0 15 30 45 60 and 120 minutes as well as at SaOvalues of 10 20 40 70 100. The serum collected is analyzed using an ELISA assay Morphine Hydromorphone and HPLC Naloxone to confirm obtainment of appropriate drug release levels. For the 2 most promising compound combinations recovery procedures are carried out with continued blood sampling at 2 weeks and 1 month. Following a terminal bleed the pigs are sacrificed and undergo histopathological examination to determine long term distribution and toxicity effects.

This example demonstrates that naloxone is released from an indolequinone based naloxone prodrug only under low oxygen conditions. Naoxone pro drug 125 M was incubated with 30 fresh frozen human plasma in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 in the presence of 133 M each of NADH and NADPH. The reaction mixture was divided into two portions and to one portion Argon gas was slowly bubbled using a capillary tube until the oxygen pressure reached 18 mm Hg monitored using a Blood Gas Analyzer. The tube was tightly sealed and transferred into a hypoxia chamber with a pOthat was maintained at 18 mm Hg by continuously passing Argon gas. The sample was incubated overnight at room temperature with the second portion incubated under normoxia condition kept outside the chamber. At the end of the time period the samples were frozen at 20 C. and the samples were thawed prior to loading onto the HPLC column. HPLC analysis was performed within 24 hours of the incubation. The analysis was performed on a reverse phase column 250 4.6 mm C5 300 A with a flow rate of 1 mL min using a gradient elution beginning at 90 10 Water Acetonitrile with 0.14 TFA and ending at 10 90 within 30 minutes. Released Naloxone was monitored and detected using a PDA detector at wavelength of 280 nm. shows that naloxone is released from an indolequinone based naloxone prodrug only under low oxygen conditions.

This example demonstrates in vivo sustained release of morphine in a guinea pig model. Male Hartley guinea pigs 375 475 g from Elm Hill labs were allowed free access to food and water before being used in the testing of analgesia effects free morphine morphine complex and morphine prodrug A complex

After collecting the blood samples from the animals the blood samples were spun down and the supernatant plasma was taken for further analysis using UPLC ultra performance liquid chromatography . Prior to subjecting the samples to UPLC the samples were pre treated to remove the plasma proteins using a solid phase extraction protocol. Using a Waters HLB micro elution plates the samples were passed through the cartridge following a washing and an equilibration step with Water and methanol respectively the samples were then loaded on to the cartridge and followed by elution with 40 60 Acetonitrile Isopropanol. The solvent was evaporated over night and the samples were reconstituted in UPLC eluent for analysis. UPLC analysis was performed using an Acquity HSS T3 column 2.1 10 mm . Flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml min. Released Morphine was monitored using a PDA detector at 280 nm. The gradient elution used for this method began at 98 2 Water Acetonitrile containing 0.14 TFA and ended with 2 98 Water Acetonitrile containing 0.14 TFA in 6.5 minutes. shows in vivo studies with a guinea pig model demonstrating that naloxone is release from naloxone pro drug only under low oxygen conditions.
