The present disclosure generally relates to media content sources such as video channels social network profiles data feeds etc. and more specifically to ranking such media content sources.

Multiple different types of media content sources are available online. Media content sources are sources of media items such as videos text strings and so forth. Users can subscribe to particular media content sources and then receive media items from those media content sources. One example of a media content source is a video channel such as provided by a video hosting service. Another example of a media content source is a user profile of a social network service. Yet another example of a media content source is a data feed such as a twitter feed provided by a social network service. Due to a vast quantity of available media content sources it may be difficult for users to find and subscribe to media content sources that interest them.

The following is a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor delineate any scope of the particular implementations of the disclosure or any scope of the claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

In an implementation of the present disclosure a processing device identifies multiple media items that meet a criterion. The media items may be those that have been accessed by a user or those pertaining to a particular subject for example. The processing device determines annotations in the media items that identify media content sources. The processing device calculates scores for the media content sources. A score is calculated for a media content source based at least in part on how many annotations identify the media content source. The processing device ranks the media content sources based on the calculated scores. The processing device then provides one or more ranked media content sources for presentation to the user.

In addition methods and systems for performing the operations of the above described implementations are also implemented. Further a computer readable storage medium is provided to store instructions for performing the operations of the above described implementations.

In one implementation a system includes means for identifying a plurality of media items that satisfy a criterion. The system further includes means for determining a plurality of annotations in the plurality of media items that identify a plurality of media content sources. The system further includes means for calculating scores for the plurality of media content sources wherein a score for a media content source of the plurality of media content sources is calculated based at least in part on a quantity of the plurality of annotations that identify the media content source. The system further includes means for ranking the plurality of media content sources based on the calculated scores. The system further includes means for providing one or more ranked media content sources for presentation to a user.

The system may additionally include means for determining a plurality of descriptions of the plurality of media items that identify the plurality of media content sources wherein the score for the media content source is calculated based on the quantity of the plurality of annotations that identify the media content source and a quantity of the plurality of descriptions that identify the media content source. Additionally or alternatively the system may include means for determining a plurality of comments to the plurality of media items that identify the plurality of media content sources wherein the score for the media content source is calculated based on the quantity of the plurality of annotations that identify the media content source and a quantity of the plurality of comments that identify the media content source. Additionally the system may include means for determining a plurality of additional annotations in the plurality of media items identifying external sources that reference the plurality of media content sources wherein the score for the media content source is calculated based on the quantity of the plurality of annotations and a quantity of the plurality of additional annotations.

Described herein are a system and method for ranking media content sources and suggesting media content sources to users for subscription and or consumption. Users can subscribe to particular media content sources and then receive media items from those media content sources. Multiple different online or web based services offer many media content sources for subscription and or consumption. For example a video hosting service can offer a multitude of channels with each channel providing a collection of videos. A video channel may include videos sharing common metadata e.g. artist genre title etc. videos uploaded by the same user and or videos in a user created playlist. Each channel may be a media content source. The videos in a channel are typically uploaded or selected by a particular entity e.g. a user that curates the channel . Channels may be dedicated to particular subjects or may have particular themes. Examples of channels include comedy channels music video channels gaming channels automotive channels sports channels and so forth. Channels can also be associated with a particular entity e.g. a particular user without being dedicated to any specific topic. Users that subscribe to a channel may receive videos from that channel for viewing.

In another example a social networking service can include millions of profiles which include user profiles as well as profiles of entities such as businesses. Each profile may be a media content source. A profile provides updates about a user or entity as the user or entity posts those updates. Updates may include music videos text images and whatever else the user has decided to post. Other users can subscribe to or follow a particular profile after which the subscribing user will receive updates when new posts are added to the profile subscribed to.

In another example a social networking and microblogging service can millions of different accounts. Each account may be a media content source. Users can subscribe to or follow other accounts after which the subscribing user receives text based messages of up to 140 characters as those messages are posted by the account subscribed to. Such messages are commonly referred to as tweets. 

In each of the above examples a particular service provider provides hundreds to millions of disparate media content sources. It can be an arduous task for users to filter through the multitude of media content sources to identify and select media content sources that those users might be interested in. Embodiments of the present invention provide a system that ranks media content sources for a user to enable the user to more easily find and subscribe to media content sources of interest.

Note that some implementations of the present disclosure are discussed with reference to videos and or channels that provide videos. Such videos may be digital videos and may be encoded in numerous different formats such as the Windows Media Real Media Audio Video Standard AVS Theora VP8 WebM VC 1 Quicktime MPEG 4 also known as MP4 Flash MPEG 2 DivX audio video interlace AVI or advanced video coding AVC video file formats. Though some implementations may be discussed with reference to videos and channels implementations of the present disclosure also apply to other digital media items such as images text strings audio files and so forth. Additionally implementations apply to media content sources other than channels such as social network profiles feeds accounts and so forth. Examples of audio files to which implementations of the present disclosure may apply include digital music and other audio clips such as moving picture experts group MPEG audio layer 3 MP3 files advanced audio coding AAC files waveform audio file format WAV files audio interchange file format AIFF files Apple Lossless m4A files etc. Examples of image files to which the implementations of the present disclosure may apply include joint photographic experts group JPEG files portable network graphics PNG files bitmap image BMP files graphics interchange format GIF files and so forth.

The client machines A N may be personal computers PCs laptops mobile phones tablet computers set top boxes televisions video game consoles digital assistants or any other computing devices. The client machines A N may run an operating system not shown that manages hardware and software of the client machines A N. A browser not shown may execute on some client machines e.g. on the OS of the client machines . The browser may be a web browser that can access content served by a content server by navigating to web pages of the content server e.g. using the hypertext transport protocol HTTP . The browser may issue queries and commands to the content server such as commands to access a specific video commands to share a video commands to optimize the video and so forth.

Some client machines A N include applications that are associated with a service provided by content server . Examples of client machines that may use such applications apps include mobile phones smart televisions tablet computers and so forth. The applications or apps may access content provided by content server issue commands to content server receive content from content server and so on without visiting web pages of content server .

Via an app or a browser the client machines A N may subscribe to one or more media content sources provided by content server . The app or browser of the client machine A N may then receive media items associated with the subscribed media content sources . Additionally the client machines A N may also upload media items to the content server for storage in a repository via the app or browser.

Server machine may be a rackmount server a router computer a personal computer a portable digital assistant a mobile phone a laptop computer a tablet computer a netbook a desktop computer a media center or any combination of the above. Server machine includes content server that serves media items from repository to client machines A N. Content server may include a multitude of media content sources and a media source recommender that ranks media content sources for users and recommends media content sources to the users based on the ranking. The nature of the media content sources may depend on the content server . For example if content server is a video hosting service then media content sources may be channels for videos. In another example if content server is a social networking service then media content sources may be user or entity profiles or accounts. Media source recommender is described in greater detail below with reference to .

In general functions described in one embodiment as being performed by the content server can also be performed on the client machines A N in other embodiments if appropriate. In addition the functionality attributed to a particular component can be performed by different or multiple components operating together. The content server can also be accessed as a service provided to other systems or devices through appropriate application programming interfaces and thus is not limited to use in websites.

Repository is a persistent storage that is capable of storing media items such as video files text strings images audio files and so forth. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art in some implementations repository might be a network attached file server while in other implementations repository might be some other type of persistent storage such as an object oriented database a relational database and so forth that may be hosted by the server machine or one or more different machines coupled to the server machine via the network . The media items stored in the repository may include user generated content that is uploaded by client machines A N. The media items may additionally or alternatively include content provided by other entities e.g. service providers such as news organizations publishers libraries and so on . Media items may or may not be associated with particular media content sources .

Content server may receive media items from client machines also referred to herein as clients A N and or a third party server machine and store those media items in repository . Uploaded media items may be associated with particular media content sources e.g. an account or channel of an entity that uploaded the media items . New media items and or an identification of the new media items may be sent to those client machines A N that have subscribed to these media content sources . Client machines A N may subsequently request to consume e.g. play or view these media items. If the media items were not already transmitted to the requesting client machines A N then content server may send the media items to these client machines A N from repository .

In the example of videos content server may stream selected videos of a media content source to clients A N or may download the videos to the clients A N. In streaming the clients A N can begin playback of the video before receiving the entire video. In contrast with downloading the video typically is not playable until a complete file is received by the client A N.

Media source recommender may be coupled to a repository which may store media items reference logs media content sources and or access logs . Alternatively different types of data may be stored in different repositories. For example access logs and reference logs may be stored in a separate repository than media items and media content sources . In one embodiment the repository stores a record of all users who have registered an account with a content server. Each registered account includes at least a user name and e mail address associated with the account. A registered account may also include information about the user associated with the account such as their name hobbies uploaded videos favorite videos and or playlists of videos created by the users. Such information may be used to adjust weighting applied to references by media items to media content sources.

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s actions or activities user s preferences etc. or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. Thus the user may have control over how much information is collected about the user and used by a content server.

Media item logger may monitor the media items accessed by a user. For each user media item logger may determine the user s interactions with media items and populate an access log with information on such interactions. The user may be logged into an account of the user in which case the user interactions may be associated with a particular user. Accordingly media items accessed over multiple sessions may be logged. Alternatively the user may be an anonymous user which may not have a user account. In such an example media item logger may log those media items accessed by the user during a single session in an access log .

Users may be subscribed to one or more media content sources. In one implementation media item logger monitors media content sources to which a user is subscribed and adds entries to the access logs for media items provided by these media content sources. Accordingly in such an implementation an access log may include entries both for media items actually accessed by a user as well as entries for media items provided by media content sources to which the user subscribes.

Each entry in the access log may identify a media item whether the media item was accessed or was unaccessed but was provided by a media content source that a user is subscribed to a time of access a device identifier ID if available data identifying the type of interaction with the media item and so forth. Interaction types can include any user interaction such as playing saving rating sharing pausing rewinding viewing commenting and forwarding a media item.

Media items may include annotations descriptions and comments described more fully below . These annotations descriptions and comments may reference media content sources and or media items associated with media content sources. Media item logger may identify rates of activation e.g. click through rates of the annotations in the media items as well as click through rates of references to media content sources and media items in comments and descriptions. Such click through rates and rates of activation may be stored in access logs or in separate logs.

Media item analyzer analyzes media items. Media item analyzer may perform an initial analysis to determine which media items satisfy one or more scoring criteria. One possible scoring criterion is a user access criterion that is satisfied if a media item was accessed by a particular user e.g. a user for which a media content source recommendation is to be made . If the user access criterion is used then media content sources may be scored and ranked based on references to those media content sources from media items accessed by the user.

Another scoring criterion is a user interest criterion that is satisfied if a media item has been accessed by other users who have also accessed media items accessed by a particular user. Media item analyzer may compare the access logs of different users. When another user who has accessed a threshold amount of the same media items accessed by the particular user in question is identified media item analyzer may determine what additional media items have been accessed by that other user. Media item analyzer may analyze those additional media items for references to media content sources and media source ranker may include data on those references in the calculation of the media content source ranking. Additionally media item analyzer may determine subjects or categories of media items accessed by a particular user. Media item analyzer may then identify other media items that are of the same category as satisfying the user interest criterion. Media item analyzer may then analyze those identified media items.

Another scoring criterion is a subject criterion. A media item satisfies a subject criterion if the media item relates to a particular subject. Such a relation to a subject may be determined based on metadata of the media item such as tags. In an example if comedy media content sources are to be ranked then media items identified as comedy media items may satisfy the subject criterion.

Another scoring criterion is a subscription criterion. A media item satisfies the subscription criterion if the media item was provided by a media content source to which a user is subscribed. If the subscription criterion is used then media content sources may be scored and ranked based on references to those media content sources from media items provided by other media content sources to which the user is subscribed.

In some implementations no scoring criteria may be used or multiple scoring criteria may be used. If no scoring criteria are used then all media items may be selected for analysis. If multiple scoring criteria are used then media items satisfying any of the multiple scoring criteria may be selected for further analysis. Alternatively those media items satisfying all of the used scoring criteria may be used.

Once media items are selected for further analysis media item analyzer analyzes those media items to identify media content sources. Media items may include multiple different types of references to media content sources. Such references may be included in annotations embedded in the media items in user comments associated with the media items in descriptions of the media items and or in other metadata associated with the media items.

Media items such as videos may include annotations that have been inserted into the video at a particular point. For example an annotation may be inserted 3 minutes into a 5 minute video. When the 3 minute point is reached during playback of the video an object e.g. a button and or or popup may be displayed in accordance with the annotation. One type of annotation that may be inserted into a media item is a call to action annotation. A call to action annotation may be a button that invites a user to press the button thus activating the annotation and initiating an action. Such an action may be directing that user to a media item e.g. a video or a media content source e.g. a channel . The object may be present during some or all of the video e.g. for 2 12 to 5 00 and may be present at a particular region of a display. In one implementation the call to action annotation may be clicked by a user to open a new web page.

If annotations are identified media item analyzer may further analyze the annotation to determine whether it is associated with or references any particular media content source. For example an annotation may redirect a user to a particular media content source e.g. a video channel or to a video or other media item associated with a media content source. Media item analyzer may identify and record such associations to media content sources.

Metadata such as a description of a media item may include a reference to one or more media content sources and or to media items that are associated with the media content sources. For example a description of a video on a particular topic may include a recommendation to visit or subscribe to a particular media content source on that topic. Media item analyzer may analyze the descriptions of media items to identify such references to media content sources and or media items. When such references are identified media item analyzer may record the identify of the referenced media content sources and or media content sources associated with the reference media items.

Users may add their own comments to media items. For example users that like a media item may post a comment to that effect. Some comments of users may include recommendations to other media items and or to media content sources. For example a user commenting on a video may state that they also really enjoyed another particular video. Media item analyzer may analyze the comments for a media item to identify any references to other media items or to media content sources. Media item analyzer may then determine media content sources associated with referenced media items and may record the identity of the media content sources.

Media item analyzer may analyze all of the media items that satisfy a scoring criterion e.g. all media items accessed by a user in one implementation . Media item analyzer may keep a record of all media content sources referenced in those media items . In one implementation media item analyzer maintains one or more reference logs each of which may be a list tabulation or other data structure of identified media content sources. The reference logs may include a separate entry for each identified media content source. Each entry may include a count of the number of references that have been made to that media content source or to media items that are associated with the media content source. The references may be divided based on reference source in one implementation. For example separate counts may be maintained for a number of annotations having references to a media content source a number of descriptions having references to a media content source a number of comments that have references to a media content source and so on.

Additionally media item analyzer may identify any links or references to external sources e.g. to external websites such as blogs social media sites news sites etc. that are included in or associated with media items that satisfy a scoring criterion. External source analyzer may analyze those external sources to determine whether those external sources include references to any media content sources and or media items associated with media content sources. For example external source analyzer may scrape a web site referenced in a feed to find any other feeds mentioned in the referenced web site. The identities of any such referenced media content sources may be recorded by external source analyzer . For example external source analyzer may add the external references to media content sources to reference logs .

Media source ranker ranks media content sources for a user based on the analysis performed by media item analyzer and or external source analyzer . To rank the media content sources media source ranker may compute scores for those media content sources to be ranked. In one implementation media source ranker computes scores for media content sources based on entries in reference logs . In a basic implementation media source ranker may add up a number of references to a media content source e.g. a number of references from annotations descriptions and or comments and this value may be the score for that media content source.

In further implementations media source ranker may determine a contribution of individual references to the media content source and then add up these contributions to compute the score for that media content source. Media source ranker may weight the contribution of a particular reference based on multiple different criteria such as reference source e.g. whether the reference was from an annotation a description or a comment whether the reference was direct or indirect e.g. whether the reference was an indirect reference from a referenced external source how long ago the media item including the reference was accessed which scoring criterion was satisfied by the media item associated with the reference e.g. whether the media item was accessed by a user provided by a media content source to which the user subscribes accessed by other users etc. and so forth. For example references from media items accessed by a user may be assigned a higher contribution than references from media items provided by media content sources to which the user subscribes. A contribution of a reference to the score may also depend on a click through rate or other activity measure for that reference. For example an annotation may provide a greater contribution to the score if that annotation was activated by numerous users than if that annotation was not activated.

If the scoring criterion used is a user access criterion then user interest in particular media items may be used to weight contributions of references to the score for a media content source. For example the contribution of a reference may be increased if the user has indicated that he or she has a particular interest in a media item including the reference. This may be indicated by the user posting a positive comment about the media item the user accessing the media item multiple times the user sharing the media item and so on.

In some instances no scoring criterion is used to filter media items. In one implementation an entire corpus of media items may be evaluated regardless of whether any particular user has accessed those media items. If media content source scoring is being performed for a particular user then media score ranker may apply a higher weight to those media content sources that were referenced from media items accessed by the user. For example in one implementation media source ranker applies a weight of 1 to references to a media content source by media items accessed by the user a weight of 0.5 to references to a media content source by media items provided by another media content source to which the user is subscribed and a weight of 0.2 to references to the media content source by media items not accessed by the user and not provided by any media content source to which the user is subscribed. Typically there will be many more media items that have not been accessed by a user than have been accessed by the user. Accordingly the scale of the applied weights may be shifted so that the weight applied to a reference from an un accessed media item is a fraction of that applied to a reference from an accessed media item. For example a weight of 0.001 may be applied to a reference from a media item that was not accessed by the user.

Once scores have been computed for multiple media content sources media source ranker ranks the media content sources based on their scores. Media content sources having higher scores may be more likely to be of interest to a user whereas media content sources having lower scores may be less likely to be of interest to the user. Accordingly media content sources having the highest scores may be ranked ahead of media content sources having lower ranks.

User interface may provide ranked media content sources for recommendation and display to a user. In one implementation those media content sources having highest ranks are displayed to a user. For example the highest ranked or media content sources may be displayed to a user. The user may also be provided with an option to view additional media content sources with lower rankings e.g. by pressing a show more button . The user may select a recommended media content source to sample media items associated with that media content source. User selection of a recommended media content source may cause for example clips from representative media items to be presented to the user. If the user determines that he or she likes the sampled media items of a media content source the user may subscribe to the media content source via the user interface e.g. by pressing a subscribe button .

User interface may recommend media content sources to users in multiple different views. In one implementation ranked media content sources are recommended to a user as part of a new user signup flow. In another implementation ranked media content sources are recommended to a user for particular categories or subjects.

At block processing logic analyzes media items in a corpus of media items to identify those media items that satisfy a scoring criterion e.g. those media items that have been accessed by a particular user those media items provided by a media content source to which the user subscribes etc. .

At block processing logic analyzes the accessed media items to identify references to media content sources. Such analysis may include performing an analysis of annotations included in the media item an analysis of the media item s description an analysis of comments made to the media item and so forth. Such analysis may additionally include identifying external sources e.g. external websites referenced in the media item and then analyzing those external sources to identify references to media content sources. A result of the analysis of the media items may be identification of one or more references made to multiple different media content sources.

At block processing logic selects a media content source that was referenced by at least one tracked media item satisfying the scoring criterion. At block processing logic calculates a score for the media content source based on a number of references to that media content source from the tracked media items satisfying the scoring criterion. In one embodiment the score is calculated based at least in part on a quantity of annotations to the media content source. At block processing logic determines whether there are any additional media content sources that have been referenced by tracked media items satisfying the scoring criterion. If so the method returns to block and a score is calculated for another media content source. If scores have been generated for all media content sources referenced by media items satisfying the scoring criterion the method continues to block .

At block processing logic ranks the media content sources based on their scores. The media content sources may be ranked in descending order based on the scores. At block processing logic provides the ranked media content sources for presentation to a user. Those media content sources having highest ranks may be presented to a user e.g. as subscription recommendations .

At block processing logic determines external sources identified in the references of the media items accessed by the user. Processing logic may then analyze those external sources e.g. by scraping external websites to find any references to media content sources.

At block processing logic calculates scores for the media content sources. The score for a media content source may be calculated based on a quantity of references that were made to that media content source. The references may be from media items accessed by the user from other media items accessed by other users and or from external sources.

At block processing logic ranks the media content sources based on their scores. At block processing logic provides the ranked media content sources for presentation to the user.

At block processing logic identifies descriptions of media items that identify the media content source. At block processing logic applies weights to score contributions of the descriptions.

In the foregoing description numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent however to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form rather than in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present disclosure.

Some portions of the detailed description have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as analyzing ranking determining enabling identifying calculating or the like refer to the actions and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The present disclosure also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium such as but not limited to any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs and magnetic optical disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.
