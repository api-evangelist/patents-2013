In method the virtual storage system interfaces with the online document storage and retrieval system e.g. the banking system as depicted in for example . At operation the virtual storage system establishes a connection with the banking system and data of a first format corresponding to specific electronic data e.g. user specific banking account data is transmitted from the banking system to the virtual storage system and stored in a database within a storage device of the virtual storage system . It should be noted that the data could for example be unstructured data or structured data generated in the banking system as a result of transactions conducted on behalf of a banking customer and transmitted by the banking system to the virtual storage system and stored within the storage device of the virtual storage system . illustrate examples of unstructured data and structured data respectively. As shown in unstructured data may be a text flat format such as notepad format. As shown in the structured data may be of an Extensible Markup language XML format for example. The XML format is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is readable by both a human and a computing device.

According to one or more embodiments the data of the first format may be transmitted periodically e.g. once per hour once per day weekly or monthly in the case of monthly statements or dynamically in real time i.e. as updates occur within the banking system .

Further from operation the process continues to operation where the data is converted from a first format into a second format. According to one embodiment the first format may be unstructured data and the second format may be structured data.

From operation the process continues to operation where the data of the second format is retrieved from the storage device and used to generate via the processor an electronic statement of a user.

From operation the process continues to operation where a first style sheet associated with the data having been previously created and stored within a storage device of the virtual storage system is retrieved for transforming the data.

According to one or more embodiments a style sheet is a computer language to express the presentation of the electronic data. For example a style sheet may include computer language which expresses the amount of spacing between text lines the colors used for the text and the backgrounds and font size and style for example. According to one or more embodiments a style sheet may be stored in a storage device as a separate file from data e.g. unstructured or structured data to thereby be reused as needed.

According to one or more embodiments the first style sheet is of a predetermined format for example an Extensible Stylesheet Language XSL format for performing XSL transformations. According to one or more embodiments the first style sheet is customized at the virtual storage system to be bank specific.

From operation the process continues to operation where the first style sheet is loaded into the system memory and retrieved by the processor to be used to transform the data. From operation the process continues to operation where the data is converted by the processor based on the first style sheet. For example according to one or more embodiments the XML data is converted i.e. transformed to Hyper Text Markup Language HTML data based on the first style sheet.

At operation a second style sheet previously created for the structured data and stored within a storage device of the virtual storage system is retrieved and is loaded on the system memory and retrieved by the processor . According to one or more embodiments the second style sheet is a cascading stylesheet CSS . The second stylesheet is used for describing the presentation semantics the style and formatting of the electronic document e.g. banking statement written in HTML. The CSS allows style information from several sources to be blended together for example corporate style guidelines styles common to a group of documents or styles specific to a single document. The second style sheet enables the separation of structured data e.g. the HTML data from the document presentation including e.g. the layout colors and fonts. The present invention is not limited to any particular type of first and second stylesheets or number of stylesheets and may vary as needed. For example according to another embodiment the second style sheet may be may be embedded into the first style sheet. From operation the process continues to operation where the data along with the second style sheet are transmitted to the user s computing device and then loaded in the processor of the user s computing device. The processor of the user s computing device processes the data along with the second style sheet such that the data is displayed on the display of the user s computing device according to the second style sheet.

According to one or more embodiments the data retrieved from the banking system may be encrypted prior to being stored within a storage location of the virtual storage system the encryption operation may be performed in a different storage location of the virtual storage system e.g. a data center than the storage location where the data is to be stored. The encryption operation may be performed in accordance with the process outlined in the co pending application Ser.
