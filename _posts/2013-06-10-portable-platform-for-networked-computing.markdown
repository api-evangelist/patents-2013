title: Portable platform for networked computing
abstract: In one embodiment, a portable, networked, computing device comprises a processor, a plurality of radios, and a memory. The device may be operable to pair, by at least one of the radios, with a device associated with a user. The device may then monitor, by one of the radios, a signal for a connection established with a first network. When the device determines that the signal for the first network has dropped below a threshold level of quality, it may enable access point mode for at least one of the paired devices by turning on a radio to establish a connection with a second network and thereby providing connectivity to the second network for the at least one of the paired devices. If multiple networks are available, the device may select an optimal network based on an assessment of one or more factors.

This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 801 526 filed 15 Mar. 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

A mobile computing device such as a smartphone tablet computer or laptop computer may include functionality for determining its location direction or orientation such as a GPS receiver compass altimeter accelerometer or gyroscope. Such a device may also include functionality for wireless communication over any conventional technology such as by way of example and not limitation BLUETOOTH near field communication NFC radio frequency e.g. RFID infrared IR Wi Fi pager or cellular e.g. 2G 3G 4G . Such a device may also include one or more cameras scanners touchscreens microphones or speakers. Mobile computing devices may also execute software applications such as games web browsers or social networking applications. With social networking applications users may connect communicate and share information with other users in their social networks.

In particular embodiments a portable networked computing device PND provides seamless and portable network connectivity for a user s devices in a device cloud. In particular embodiments the PND may be a stand alone small e.g. key fob sized device in other embodiments the PND may be integrated into one of the user s devices e.g. a smartphone or tablet computing device . The PND may be designed to take advantage of any available network connection in order to act as a network access point for devices that may not include all of the same capabilities. A PND may be paired with one or more devices with which it may communicate directly in a peer to peer fashion by low power radio when it is within a threshold proximity with the PND paired device s . The PND itself may monitor network availability and or link quality and turn on one or more of its own additional radios on an as needed basis conserves power and may reduce cost . For example when the PND detects that WiFi signals are becoming weak it may activate its cellular radio to seamlessly provide network connectivity to paired devices within proximity of the PND.

A brand new device being introduced into the user s device cloud may take advantage of proximity to devices already registered as being associated with the user to jump start customization of the user s experience with the device using social networking information. In addition when a guest enters a PND user s home the guest s PND will attempt to establish a peer to peer connection with one of the user s devices in the device cloud. The guest may be authenticated in accordance with social graph information and other social networking information e.g. first degree friends may automatically be authenticated to access and use the user s devices . Such access may be granted restricted according to any property or attribute associated with an element of the user s social graph e.g. only allowing access to other social network users in a designated Close Friends group to be automatically authenticated upon entering the user s home .

Mobile portable PND paired devices in the user s device cloud may include a 2G radio or a two way pager radio so that the device can send out an alert and communicate its location if it determines that it is lost based on an inability to detect the PND within range.

A user may be able to use one of the devices in the device cloud to control one or more mobile portable PND paired devices comprising the user s device cloud e.g. PND phone tablet laptop automobile watch camera . In a group situation such as where each member of a household has their own individual PND that is carried on their person each PND may be configured for individual authentication and levels of authorization to access and or control devices in the household device cloud. Roaming users to whom members of the household may be connected by way of a social graph may be granted permissions in accordance with social graph information and other social networking information.

A user interface may be provided on the control device to control other devices in the device cloud. Such a control interface may be displayed in a convenient manner so as not to impair the user experience. For example if the control device is a smartphone the interface to control other devices may be provided in such a way so as not to require the user to unlock their smartphone in order to use the interface. Icons to control one or more devices may appear on the locked screen interface based on proximity of the smartphone to the one or more devices.

A portable networked computing device PND that can act as a universal control and network access point for one or more devices with which the PND is paired. In particular embodiments a PND may comprise a portable device e.g. key fob sized device including network components to enable the PND to pair with and communicate with PND paired devices. In particular embodiments a PND pairs with devices using a radio e.g. a low power radio using the Bluetooth low energy BLE standard or a conventional radio using the soft access point functionality of the WI FI DIRECT standard that requires that any such paired devices be within a threshold proximity to the PND.

PND may be designed to take advantage of any available network connection while acting as a network access point for devices that may not include all of the same capabilities. A PND paired device may thereby be able to conserve power without sacrificing network connectivity by including only low power radios which may also improve the device s form factor both by eliminating cellular radio s and antenna e as well as reducing the size of the battery allowing for a slimmer lighter device .

PND may include antennae and one or more low power and high power radios for various types of network connections e.g. cellular e.g. 2G 3G 4G 4G LTE Wi Fi e.g. 802.11n 802.11ac 802.11ad WiGig Wi Fi based higher level protocols e.g. INTEL WIRELESS DISPLAY WiDi Wi Fi mesh e.g. ITU T G.hn TV whitespace mesh TVWS or 802.11af GPS Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy near field communication NFC satellite pager radio etc.

In particular embodiments PND may also include external physical features such as for example and not by way of limitation a button interface a status indicator a small low power screen a memory card slot and connection ports e.g. USB Ethernet optical . In particular embodiments a PND may be able to connect to a power adapter draw power from a received RF signal generate power using integrated piezoelectric components or otherwise utilize power using any conventional source.

Each PND paired device may be able to use PND for network connectivity either on a constant basis e.g. whenever the user holding PND is within proximity to the PND paired device or on an as needed basis e.g. whenever the PND paired device s network connectivity becomes sporadic weak unavailable or costly based on financial cost to the user or energy resource consumption by the PND paired device .

For example PND may comprise a small device attached to a user s keychain that has cellular and Wi Fi connectivity and is paired with tablet and telephone via Wi Fi Bluetooth or NFC. Since PND is seamlessly connected to the Internet at all times if user carries tablet and telephone around in a bag PND may provide user with a seamless connection to the Internet regardless of where user might go taking PND and the user s PND paired devices so as to provide IP based telephony and messaging capabilities to telephone and Internet connectivity to tablet . PND may also be paired with and provide network connectivity for other devices so that the user is able to use network enabled features on any such devices as long as PND is within the threshold proximity to the device.

Since PND can act as an access point and thereby establish a local private network for devices paired with PND multiple devices connected to one PND may also be able to communicate with each other via PND even when PND is not connected to an external network.

In particular embodiments one of more of the PND paired devices may operate as dumb terminal devices that become personalized computing devices upon pairing with a user s PND. A dumb terminal device may include any computing device that does not persistently store user specific information and can be temporarily converted into a personalized computing device for a user e.g. public or shared use . PND may be able to pair with and utilize a dumb terminal device for any and all suitable purposes. In some embodiments PND may wirelessly pair with a device in some embodiments PND may be able to physically plug into the device.

For example a library may provide number of standard issue desktop computers i.e. dumb terminal devices wherein a member of the library can pair a desktop computer with their PND and the PND will configure desktop computer to adopt the user s preferences e.g. desktop theme language settings and time zone comply with the user s security policies e.g. authentication authorization and screen lock timeout policies and access and load the user s content e.g. social networking information music library photo album subscribed periodicals .

In another example user may be able to get into car an autonomous robot driven taxicab which upon pairing with PND authenticates user provides personalized destination suggestions for user e.g. the user s home workplace school or a destination specified in the user s calendar authorizes payment for user based on the user s selected destination and transports user to their selected destination in accordance with their personal preferences e.g. as fast as possible or controlled and leisurely while providing videoconferencing facilities for user during the ride.

PND may also store user specific authentication and authorization credentials payment credentials e.g. smart card chip telephony identifiers e.g. SIM card configuration settings preferences favorites lists bookmarks applications or any other data to enable PND to facilitate personalized and secure computing in conjunction with the PND paired devices. In particular embodiments certain PND paired devices e.g. home security system a safe a gun locker a bicycle chain a laptop security cable may comprise additional components for security purposes e.g. sensors and logic to perform biometric identification .

In particular embodiments PND may be able to disavow a pairing with a dumb terminal device without leaving any trace of personal information usage logs or other user identifying information on the dumb terminal device.

A PND itself may monitor network availability and or link quality and turn on one or more of its radios on an as needed basis in order to conserve power and reduce cost e.g. turning on a high power radio such as a cellular radio or turning on a radio that provides a connection to a network requiring payment to use bandwidth . When the link quality e.g. as characterized by received signal strength indication RSSI detected by PND drops below a particular threshold i.e. begins to decrease to the point where it appears the user is going to leave the zone of the Wi Fi network PND turns on the cellular radio and goes into access point mode on its Wi Fi to seamlessly provide network connectivity to paired devices within threshold proximity of PND . The threshold may be characterized according to any of a number of different attributes of the signal including but not limited to signal strength signal to noise ratio average data throughput average data latency or any other attribute of the signal or any combination of attributes. The threshold may also be characterized by one or more data quality metrics as well such as the current and or historical throughput to a known site e.g. a social networking website with respect to either latency and or throughput for example if the latency exceeds the threshold or the throughput drops below the threshold then PND may go into access point mode . In particular embodiments either PND and or the PND paired device may be able to detect network availability and or link quality. In particular embodiments PND may obtain such information from the PND paired device and vice versa.

In particular embodiments PND may calculate the threshold and or make this determination to go into access point mode based off of other factors or conditions besides simply detecting a real time drop in RSSI such as for example historical data logging RSSI data at particular locations e.g. the PND is being carried by the user and headed in the direction of a dead spot where RSSI has historically dropped below some threshold designations of low RSSI locations e.g. inside of a secure military complex that blocks all wireless signals except those on a particular bandwidth or designations of estimated RSSI at particular locations e.g. network coverage maps calculated based on signal type and base station location information . In particular embodiments such factors may be determined based on information shared across a network of users such as for example a network of registered PND users a network of users associated with an organization e.g. a company s employees or a group of customers paying for network service or a social network of users connected within a social graph.

When a PND paired device loses network connectivity e.g. moves out of range of a home Wi Fi network the device may automatically begin utilizing PND for network connectivity. PND itself may continually monitor the level of connectivity with familiar networks and only serve as an access point when it detects that any signals from familiar networks is becoming attenuated.

In particular embodiments PND may be able to perform seamless handoffs between different types of networks so as to avoid any interruption in connectivity. Once a PND paired device comes into range of a familiar network it may be able to seamlessly switch back from using PND for network connectivity to using the familiar network e.g. when the user comes home and is within range of a home Wi Fi network the user s tablet may switch over to connect to the home Wi Fi network .

At step the PND may pair with one or more devices. For example while the user is at home and within threshold proximity to any or all of phone desktop computer refrigerator security system television TV tablet and camera the PND may remain paired to any such devices. In particular embodiments the PND may pair with a device in order to retrieve network connectivity information prior to configuring any network connections. In particular embodiments PND may require that initial pairing with a device take place using a radio that requires very close proximity such as NFC or by a Wi Fi or Bluetooth radio where distance is determined by a maximum RSSI threshold in order to provide extra security and help avoid inadvertently pairing PND with a device.

At step the PND may monitor available networks and detect a familiar network e.g. a home Wi Fi network . As long as the detected signal for the network is of sufficient quality the PND may itself utilize the familiar network for network connectivity and expect that any PND paired devices will do the same. In particular embodiments the PND may automatically determine that a detected network is a familiar network because it is provided by another user that is known to user e.g. a social networking connection of user . The PND may identify the provider of a network by detecting the other user s PND and identifying and or authenticating that PND. In particular embodiments the PND belonging to user may utilize particular security measures based on attributes of the detected network e.g. whether it is an open or secured network or whether the other user is a trusted friend of user or simply a friend of a friend . In particular embodiments the PND belonging to user may limit or throttle back certain types of network communications by paired devices based on attributes of the detected network e.g. if the detected network require payment based on bandwidth usage or quantity of data downloaded or if the detected network imposes bandwidth limits .

In particular embodiments a PND may be able to access a mesh network grid formed when a sufficient density of users within a geographic region provide wireless network access to which PND can connect. A PND carrying user may be able to travel significant distances e.g. across a city without activating any cellular radios or other high power radios simply by switching from wireless network to wireless network. For example in a particular region many if not all residents may have set up individual Wi Fi and or television whitespace TVWS networks wherein a user s PND is configured to access some or all such networks in addition to more far ranging networks e.g. commercial cellular networks to provide seamless connectivity for devices that paired with the user s PND .

Such embodiments may facilitate security and or bandwidth consumption control for a unit of a mesh network e.g. an individual home Wi Fi network by establishing rules that place restrictions upon roaming users who wish to connect to their wireless network such as by way of example and not limitation 1 restricting access to other social network users e.g. by confirming that they have a valid user identifier 2 restricting access to other social network users within their social graph 3 restricting access to other social network users within a threshold degree of separation 4 restricting access according to any other property or attribute associated with an element of the user s social graph e.g. only allowing access to other social network users in a designated group 5 restricting access to particular days or times 6 only allowing access to particular users e.g. other social network users who are not within the user s social graph by charging a connection fee 7 restricting access to a maximum number of roaming users 8 restricting access to a maximum bandwidth per device 9 restricting access to particular application types 10 restricting access by a connection timeout 11 restricting access to only allow connections by roaming users who also contribute to the access grid by providing their own wireless networks or any combination of such rules.

At step the PND may detect that the signal for the familiar network is dropping or has dropped below a threshold level of quality e.g. the signal drops becomes unstable or attenuated and enable its access point mode in step thereby providing network connectivity for any paired devices. The threshold level of quality of a network signal may be determined as discussed above based off of various factors and or conditions. For example if user has walked out of their home holding telephone tablet and camera gotten into automobile and begun driving off the PND may detect that it is no longer within range of the home Wi Fi network and is now only within range of a home TVWS network. At this point the PND may enable its access point mode in order to provide seamless connectivity for telephone tablet camera and automobile . In particular embodiments the PND may enable its access point mode simply based on the fact that user entered and turned on automobile since at that point it is very likely that user will imminently move out of range of the home Wi Fi network. In particular embodiments the PND may only enable access point mode if the PND detects PND paired devices within threshold proximity to the PND thereby conserving power if there are no devices that may need to use the PND for network connectivity .

The PND may also commence performing operations in order to smoothly establish a network connection for any such devices so that they can continue communication via the PND instead of the familiar network such as for example initiating facilitating a soft handoff by temporarily utilizing both the familiar network and the PND access point in parallel. The PND may use multi frequency radios 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz to ensure that it can maintain access point mode and test the quality of the familiar network. PND could also use GPS or indoor beacons to determine the imminent dropout of the original Wi Fi. PND and the user devices could also communicate in a peer to peer fashion to mutually evaluate network changes.

In particular embodiments rather than switching between networks the PND may combine available bandwidth across multiple networks e.g. in order to meet a specified Quality of Service standard or requirement for transmission of particular types of content such as high definition video .

At step the PND may detect that the signal for the familiar network is of sufficient quality again or that another familiar network is now within range and disable its access point mode in step . In particular embodiments if the PND detects that there are any paired devices that are communicating via the PND the PND may perform operations in order to smoothly hand off the network connection for any such devices so that they are instead connected to the familiar network. For example if user has arrived at work and PND detects the user s work Wi Fi network or if user has arrived at an often frequented caf with a TVWS network the PND may connect to the newly detected network initiate facilitate a soft handoff for any devices that are currently utilizing the PND for network connectivity e.g. telephone and tablet and then disable its access mode. In particular embodiments PND may detect that a paired device is utilizing the PND for a high demand activity e.g. making a telephone call or streaming high bandwidth content and postpone disabling access point mode until the activity has ended.

If more than one network is available the selection of which particular network to join may included an assessment of which network is optimal wherein the analysis may be based on any number of cost factors including but not limited to technical factors economic factors security factors and user preference factors such as for example available bandwidth network type e.g. 4G cellular vs. TVWS vs. 802.11n signal strength noise level of interference resource consumption required to establish and maintain a connection with the network e.g. utilizing a radio to connect to a cellular network may require more power than a radio to connect to a Wi Fi network whether a particular network is familiar to PND e.g. PND previously successfully connected to the network or has a stored password to access the network whether there is any cost incurred by connecting to the network e.g. is there free access is the access free but the network require that you use software that displays ads is this a sunk cost where the user is already paying for a regular subscription to the network is the access pay per use whether the network is operated by a known person or entity e.g. by your employer by another user to whom you are connected in a social networking system by the host of an event for which the user has purchased admission level of available security e.g. open vs. WEP vs. WPA2 etc.

Once a PND paired device e.g. telephone comes into range of a network associated with a particular phone number for the user e.g. home network or work network the PND paired device may ring in response to callers calling the particular phone number. For example when the user is at home within range of their home network the PND paired device may detect an incoming call to the home phone number and cause the device to ring. PND may also be able to provide an IP based telephone feature that works transparently across international boundaries and across disparate networks which may operate based on disparate technologies in particular embodiments a phone number may be associated with a user s social networking user identity and a first user of a social network may be able to call a second user of the social network simply by dialing the second user using their social networking identifier e.g. login username .

Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of where appropriate. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of as occurring in a particular order this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method of occurring in any suitable order. Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

Typically when a user sets up a new personalized device such as an ANDROID or APPLE IOS device the user is required to log in to the device with their existing user ID. The setup process may require that the user enter their password repeatedly which may be cumbersome for the user. Oftentimes it may be quite awhile before the device can present the user with a customized experience on the device based on profile information associated with their existing user login. In addition when using the device to make purchases a user may again need to enter their password repeatedly.

In step PND or a device that has already been paired with PND senses a new un paired device within a threshold proximity. In particular embodiments the new device itself may sense that it is within threshold proximity of PND or a PND paired device. For example if the user purchases a new tablet device online and has it shipped to their home when the user brings the tablet into their home the tablet may come within threshold proximity of the user s PND and or one or more devices registered as being associated with the user. The new tablet may also sense that it is within range of the user s home Wi Fi network wherein the user s Wi Fi router is paired with PND . The threshold proximity may be determined by the natural range of a particular radio that is to be used for pairing new devices. For example in order to prevent inadvertent pairings or attempts to pair a device some embodiments may require that a near field communication NFC radio be used for pairing new devices. In other embodiments e.g. where pairing is performed using a network technology with a longer signal range such as Wi Fi Direct or BLE the threshold proximity may be configured at a particular distance e.g. one foot or less or one meter or less or in accordance with an RSSI indicator e.g. upper value for saturation .

In particular embodiments a brand new device being introduced into the user s device cloud may be able take advantage of proximity to a PND or other devices that have already been registered as being associated with the user in order to jump start customization of the user s experience with the device by using social networking information. In particular embodiments a user s profile may be pre configured to permit purchase activation of a brand new device when the user accesses a purchase activation interface on the new device and the new device is within a threshold proximity of one or more other devices already registered as being associated with the user.

In step in particular embodiments the new device pairs with the user s PND and joins the user s device cloud. As part of the pairing process PND may attempt to establish a direct peer to peer style connection with the device in order to exchange initial information. The user s PND may store the initial information associated with the new device e.g. device ID MAC address and the new device may likewise store the initial information associated with the PND e.g. PND ID . In particular embodiments if the new device is within range of the user s home Wi Fi network the new device may be able to pair with the user s PND even if it is not within threshold proximity of PND e.g. even if user left PND at their workplace the new device may still be able to pair with PND by connecting to PND over the Internet via the home Wi Fi network in order to jump start customization of the user s experience with the device .

In step the new device may provide information to PND . For example a device belonging to user may have established its own network connectivity settings e.g. Wi Fi service set identifiers SSIDs encryption configuration settings and passwords prior to pairing with PND which it may then share with PND upon pairing with PND .

In step the new device may obtain user information from the PND or another PND paired device. For example based on the state of the tablet as a brand new device and the proximity of the tablet with one or more other devices and or the presence of the device within the user s home Wi Fi network the tablet may obtain identifying information for the user such as the user s social networking user identifier.

In step the new device uses the user information to provide a customized user experience for user . For example the tablet may use the user s social networking user identifier to establish a connection to the social network and begin downloading some information of various types in order to present an out of the box social network based user experience e.g. by displaying a cover photo on the locked screen by being allowed to access the user s home Wi Fi network by setting basic device settings and or metadata in accordance with the user s preferences such as time zone preferred language etc. . In some embodiments full access to the device and to the user s social networking information as presented on the device may not be granted until the user enters their social networking system credentials into the device. In particular embodiments a brand new device may be encoded with the user s social networking user identifier on an integrated chip e.g. an RFID NFC tag at a factory warehouse or some other point in a distribution chain so that the device can begin downloading some information of various types in order to present an out of the box social network based user experience his case the user may not be required to enter their social networking password as long as the new device is placed within a threshold proximity to another device already registered as being associated with the user.

Once user has set up one or more PND paired devices the user may wish to securely provide a guest with access to devices in the user s device cloud e.g. refrigerator TV and automobile . Guest may be authenticated in accordance with social graph information and other social networking information e.g. first degree friends may automatically be authenticated to access and use the user s devices . Such access may be granted restricted according to any property or attribute associated with an element of the user s social graph e.g. only allowing access to other social network users in a designated Close Friends group to be automatically authenticated upon entering the user s home .

In step in particular embodiments when guest enters the user s home and comes within threshold proximity of a device for example TV guest s PND will attempt to establish a direct peer to peer style connection with TV . The requirement that a direct connection be established between PND and the user s device implies that guest is standing in the presence of the user thus reducing the likelihood of gaining access through spoofing. In particular embodiments for this type of authentication use case PND may be required to establish the direct connection using NFC or another type of wireless technology where the threshold proximity is very low such that guest is required to be very close to the device as opposed to standing outside a window .

In step once a direct connection has been established the device may attempt to authenticate and or authorize access for guest . For example TV may retrieve a social networking user ID for guest from PND access a social networking system and determine whether guest and the user are connected within a social graph of a social networking system. If yes TV may recognize guest as a friend of the user and display an interface for the user to grant credentials to guest . Such credentials may be assigned an expiration timestamp or be revoked. In particular embodiments the device may grant access in accordance with an authorization level based on whether guest is connected to user within a threshold degree of separation based on whether guest belongs to a user designated group of trusted friends or a user designated black list of untrusted friends or based on some other information associated with guest .

In particular embodiments use of a PND may support multi factor authentication of a guest to whom a user may be connected by way of a social graph. The possession factor may be satisfied by guest carrying the PND on their person. In an example relying on possession inherence of a kind when guest enters the user s house and attempts to pair their PND with the user s TV PND may transmit a token to the TV which uses that token to search for guest in the user s social graph and retrieve their user profile. The TV may then display guest s profile and ask the user to click a button on their own PND to confirm their guest s identity and permit guest to pair their PND with the TV. In an example relying on possession knowledge after the TV locates guest in the user s social graph the TV may display a request for guest to enter authentication credentials such as a password or swipe gesture pattern e.g. by using a remote control of the TV by using PND by using another device paired with PND or by using a device paired with PND . In an example relying upon two degrees of possession the user s own PND or a PND belonging to someone else in the household may also need to be present. In particular embodiments authentication may be require that PND be within threshold proximity of at least a minimum number of devices in user s device cloud e.g. three PND paired devices if PND can be determined to be within threshold proximity of at least those minimum number of user s devices guest may be authenticated the assumption being that guest could not be within threshold proximity of that many of user s devices without having been invited in . The more rigorous requirements of multi factor authentication may also be applied selectively e.g. for guests who are not first degree friends of the user within the social graph .

In particular embodiments a PND may be authenticated using a token based peer to peer technique as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 843 155 filed 15 Mar. 2013 and titled Wireless Data Privacy Maintained Through a Social Network. In particular embodiments authentication may be performed

In step the device grants access and or control to guest based on the detected presence of their PND . In some embodiments if PND is not detected the device may temporarily or permanently disable access control or only certain types of access control until PND is detected and or guest re authenticates their identity . In particular embodiments this process may also include steps to authorize guest to access different features of the device. For example at the moment when a user confirms that guest should be authenticated the user may also manually configure access permissions for guest with respect to the device. In another example access permissions may be automatically configured in accordance with guest s social networking profile and other social networking information. For example if guest is a child the TV s range of channels may automatically be limited to those deemed appropriate for children.

Although PND has been described as being associated with a single user in particular embodiments PND may be used by a group of users e.g. a family or group of friends to provide connectivity to devices associated with any user in the group and or to allow any user in the group to connect to a dumb terminal device. In particular embodiments such a PND may be associated with a group profile including any suitable type of information described herein e.g. group level authorization and security settings payment credentials for a group bank account shared group content . In particular embodiments PND may be used in association with a social networking system to automatically detect and permit access to friends of a user of PND such access may be restricted by degree of separation within the user s social graph.

Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of where appropriate. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of as occurring in a particular order this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method of occurring in any suitable order. Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

In some embodiments when a PND paired device determines that it has been lost because it is neither within range of the PND nor within range of a familiar network the device may include a 2G radio or a two way pager radio so that the device can send out an alert and communicate its location. Such a device may utilize an IP address that can be geo located or in the case of Wi Fi the SSID password combination may be used to designate a trusted location home work friend s house etc. .

In particular pager radios are often used in emergency situations for reasons that make them ideal for use when integrated into a device that has been lost 1 pager networks are typically based on simulcast delivery by satellite controlled networks with many overlapping pager transmitters 2 pager radios can penetrate solid structures much more easily than other radios e.g. cellular or Wi Fi and 3 pager radios draw very little power.

In some embodiments no alert may be generated if a device happens to be within range of a trusted network e.g. home Wi Fi network or is able to maintain a peer to peer connection with PND . In some embodiments the 2G or pager radio remains powered off until the PND paired device does not detect PND and is not within range of a trusted network.

As discussed above by pairing a device with PND the user may be able to activate control and otherwise use devices in the device cloud. By connecting with the PND one or more devices in the device cloud may be used to communicate with and control actively or automatically one or more other devices in the device cloud. A control interface may be provided on one device the control device to control other devices in the device cloud. In particular embodiments the control device may only provide controls for particular controllable devices in the device cloud e.g. those that are sensed within a threshold proximity those that include a remote interaction interface by which the device can receive and process commands for remote control those for which the user of PND has been granted authorization to control the device or those that are available e.g. powered on connected to a network operational and or enabled for remote control .

When smartphone comes within a threshold proximity of various devices in device cloud an icon for each device may appear on the screen of smartphone . For example in when user carries smartphone into the living room UI displays icons for four devices within threshold proximity Main Television the TV in the living room Curtains Living Room Lights and Downstairs Thermostat. The standard for being within threshold proximity may differ from one PND paired device to another based on factors such as the range of radio s used to establish a connection with the PND paired device e.g. a big screen TV with a Wi Fi receiver may have a larger range than a watch with a Bluetooth receiver the usage profile of the PND paired device e.g. the normal distance for usage and operation of a big screen TV viewing distance may be farther than the normal distance for usage and operation of a touchscreen tablet a comfortable arm s length distance etc. If user selects the icon for a particular device an interface may be displayed that enables smartphone to act as a remote control for the selected device. As shown in when user selects the Living Room Lights icon an interface is displayed to enable user to control two arrays of dimmer controlled overhead recessed lighting in the living room while watching television. As shown in when user selects the Downstairs Thermostat icon user can also control the air conditioning and subfloor heating in the living room.

In another example scenario when the user is watching a movie on the TV 1 an interface may be provided on the smartphone through which the user can control a remote control car and 2 a picture in picture PiP display may appear on the TV where the user can monitor a video camera mounted on the remote control car to follow the user s toddler or puppy around and monitor what they are doing in another room.

In another example scenario if a user is working in their home office upstairs with the door closed the user s laptop may display a first notification when the front door is being opened by someone with a key at which point a control interface may appear on the screen of the laptop to display an image of the user s child captured by a security camera mounted at the front door and then the user s laptop may display a second notification when the TV downstairs has just been turned on and the channel changed to view cartoons at which point the control interface may provide a feature to take over control of the TV and either turn it off change the channel to an educational channel or transmit audio through the TV s speakers so that the user can tell their child to go do their homework .

In another example scenario as the user walks through the house before going to bed different interfaces may pop up on the screen of the smartphone as the user walks down a hallway and passes different rooms where each interface displays a UI to control aspects of the associated room e.g. to turn off lights lock doors turn off TVs silence phone ringers draw curtains etc. . As shown in after user is done watching television and goes upstairs to go to bed smartphone senses devices in the master bedroom and displays icons to control those devices Master Bedroom Television Security System Bedroom Lights Upstairs Thermostat. 

In some embodiments instead of having a single designated control device that is physically carried with the user PND may transfer the designation from device to device within the device cloud based on which device that is able to provide an adequate control interface is in closest proximity to PND and presumably the user . Different types of control interfaces e.g. display screen embedded microphone to detect spoken commands embedded 3D motion sensor to detect gesture commands etc. may be integrated into different types of devices. For example when the user is in their car with embedded microphones and a touch screen in the dashboard the user may command the garage door to open and the oven to begin pre heating as the car turns onto their street and PND comes within Wi Fi range of the user s house . After the user parks their car in the garage PND detects that the user has walked away from the car and into the kitchen and transfers the control device designation from the car to a refrigerator with an interactive screen embedded microphones and embedded 3D motion sensors in the door. Now that the refrigerator is the designated control device while the user is cooking in the kitchen the user can monitor a videocamera trained on a baby sleeping upstairs and while hands are messy give spoken commands and or motion gesture commands to the refrigerator to reply to a text message sent to smartphone .

In particular embodiments automatic and active controls may be triggered simultaneously for example if there is one person in a large home with many rooms as the person walks through different rooms in the house to cook dinner watch TV use the restroom and go to sleep each room may automatically adjust the temperature and lighting as the user enters and leaves the room and an interface to may briefly pop up on the user s smartphone for the first 20 seconds after the user enters a new room to allow the user to actively control the temperature and lighting as well.

In a group situation such as where each member of a household has their own individual PND that is carried on their person each PND may be configured for individual authentication and authorization. In this manner different permissions may be granted to each PND e.g. the parents may have administrative level controls over all devices whereas teenagers may have restricted controls and toddlers pets may have no controls . In this scenario when each PND is paired with one or more devices in the house automatic controls may be implemented to control a particular device based on the particular PND that is detected in proximity to the device.

For example a toddler s or puppy s PND may be configured so that the PND acts as a tracking device that notifies devices in the home as the PND approaches. If the PND and or a PND paired device detects that the toddler puppy is approaching the PND may send a signal to the PND paired device to take certain actions that would not be triggered by a PND configured for an adult or older child e.g. a mechanized baby gate automatically closes off access to a stairwell . In another example if a toddler wakes up and approaches the living room where adults are watching a horror movie the TV may automatically pause the movie and display a screensaver or a channel appropriate for children. In another example if a secure cabinet containing medicines liquor cleaning supplies detects that a child is approaching the cabinet without any adults in proximity the secure cabinet may lock its door s .

In a situation involving one or more roaming users each carrying a PND on their person who are not members of the household varying levels of control may be granted to the roaming users based on social networking information or other information. For example differing access permissions may be granted to different service providers depending on their different roles e.g. gardeners may need access to a side gate to the backyard but not access into the house a nanny may need access to the house but not to the parents bedroom or the home office a housecleaner may need access to almost all areas of the house houseguests staying at the house while the owner is away may obtain access to everything except particular closets and the liquor cabinet and may not be granted access to purchase on demand movies .

Other roaming users to whom members of the household may be connected by way of a social graph may be granted permissions in accordance with social graph information and other social networking information e.g. first degree friends may automatically be granted access to the home Wi Fi network . Such permissions may be granted restricted by as examples without limitation 1 restricting access to other social network users e.g. by confirming that they have a valid user identifier 2 restricting access to other social network users within their social graph 3 restricting access to other social network users within a threshold degree of separation or 4 restricting access according to any other property or attribute associated with an element of the user s social graph e.g. only allowing access to other social network users in a designated group .

In particular embodiments UI may be displayed in a convenient manner so as not to impair the user experience. For example if a smartphone and a PND are detected as being within proximity of the TV the interface to control the TV may be provided in such a way so as not to require the user to unlock their smartphone in order to use the interface e.g. displaying controls on the locked screen interface where the user is also prompted to unlock their smartphone . In another example a notification may be sent to the smartphone that when clicked on opens up the device control interface without unlocking the smartphone. In another example one or more icons to control one or more devices may appear on the locked screen interface based on proximity of the smartphone to the one or more devices.
