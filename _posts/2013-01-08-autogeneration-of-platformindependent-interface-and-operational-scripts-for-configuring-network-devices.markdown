title: Auto-generation of platform-independent interface and operational scripts for configuring network devices
abstract: A network device is described that parses configuration data of the network device in accordance with a schema, for candidate configuration parameters. The device outputs a parameter identifier of each candidate configuration parameter, and in response, receives an indication of a selection of the candidate configuration parameters and corresponding labels. Both the selected parameters and the labels conform to a platform-independent interface for a remote procedure call for provisioning a service on any one of a plurality of different devices within a network. The device generates a device-specific configuration script for modifying the configuration data of the device in accordance with the schema of the device. The device-specific configuration script can receive, via the platform-independent interface for the remote procedure call, parameterized information associated with the selected parameters and update the configuration data based on the parameterized information.
