This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 677 990 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INTERFACING WITH STUDENTS OVER A NETWORK filed Jul. 31 2012 the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention is generally directed to learning systems and methods and in particular the present invention relates to a student messaging for geographically dispersed students.

With developments in the education industry students seek access to course related information and their own course work anywhere anytime. Students want current relevant interesting and engaging course materials and assignments taught by teachers instructors counselors and advisors who are aware of student s educational and professional path and goals based on a clear map of course progress and degree program. Enabling and facilitating students online activities around their campus is a major consideration in providing the desired student experience.

Online education now demands providing educational services to a diverse global audience from different cultural backgrounds. Education providers face the challenge of providing high quality education across a diverse student population. Educational programs must provide skills that students can apply in their lives and professions to make a real difference in the real world. Educators must strive to create a community of learners connected to one another. A learning management system LMS as referred to in the art is software for delivering tracking and managing training of students. LMSs range from systems for managing student training records to software for distributing courses over the Internet and offering features for online collaboration. In many instances LMSs are used to automate record keeping as well as to register students for classroom and online courses. Self registration faculty led learning learning workflow the provision of on line learning e.g. read and understand on line assessment management of continuous professional education CPE collaborative learning e.g. application sharing discussion threads and learning resource management e.g. instructors facilities 

Conceptually there is no difference between the role of a teacher in conventional LMSs and the role of a teacher in a bricks and mortar classroom. In both cases the students are grouped and assigned a specific teacher. The teacher introduces all course content and materials into the classroom and mediates and assesses the learning process of the student. Thus under LMS the web is a tool to replicate as closely as possible the traditional classroom environment and the LMS is limited by its system boundaries just as the physical classroom is limited by four walls and doors.

With advances in content and media delivery technologies the LMS model has not fully taken advantage of the available features for educating students. For example such advances allow students to access educational content not only via laptops and desktops but also smart phones PDA s iPods Netbooks and eBooks. It is for example estimated that the majority of prospective student market has a smart phone or PDA with advances content delivery capabilities via downloadable applications or by content streaming. These new devices have enabled users access to podcasting wikis blogs web cams eBook readers MP3 players social networks and virtual learning environments.

Conventional LMS developers attempt in incorporating new features into their existing systems in some cases can result in significant developments cost in redesigning their content to incorporate the functionality of these new technologies. In other cases the developers may have to open up their system platform through application programming interfaces API s to bolt on new technological capabilities. LMS redesign investment may be expensive especially when new development work may not be able to keep up with the proliferation of ever advancing technologies and features. Opening up platforms through APIs may present a significant competitive disadvantage to LMS vendors and service providers who have invested heavily in their proprietary instructional material delivery systems.

Additionally educational services are increasingly offered over global networks of institutions and universities. For example Laureate Education Inc. the assignee of the present application currently offers accredited campus based and online courses in a wide variety of programs including undergraduate and graduate degree programs and specializations to nearly a wide range of students in numerous countries. Such a global educational network requires supporting learning environments that are tailored to bring to students a global perspective blended with a local point of view creating a truly multicultural career oriented educational experience for students. For example the educational experience may be a career focused or licensing program a multi year undergraduate degree program or master s and or doctorate degree program in any one of a number of fields including engineering education business health care hospitality architecture and information technology etc.

The advent of social networking platforms is impacting the way s in which learners engage with technology in general. Curriculum uses of social networking services also can include sharing curriculum related resources. Educators tap into user generated content to find and discuss curriculum related content for students. Responding to the popularity of social networking services among many students teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in traditional classroom environments as they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative authentic and or flexible non linear learning experiences. Some social networks such as English baby and LiveMocha are explicitly education focused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environment. The Web 2.0 technologies built into most social networking services promote conferencing interaction creation research on a global scale enabling educators to share remix and repurpose curriculum resources. In short social networking services can become research networks as well as learning network.

The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Educators and advocates of new digital literacies are confident that social networking encourages the development of transferable technical and social skills of value in formal and informal learning. In a formal learning environment goals or objectives are determined by an outside department or agency. Tweeting instant messaging or blogging enhances student involvement. Students who would not normally participate in class are more apt to partake through social network services. Networking allows participants the opportunity for just in time learning and higher levels of engagement. The use of social networking allows educators to enhance the prescribed curriculum. When learning experiences are infused into a website that students utilize every day for fun students realize that learning can and should be a part of everyday life.

Social networking services foster learning through what is described as a Participatory Culture. A participatory culture consists of a space that allows engagement sharing mentoring and an opportunity for social interaction. Participants of social network services may avail themselves of this opportunity. Informal learning in the forms of participatory and social learning online is an excellent tool for teachers to sneak in material and ideas that students will identify with and therefore in a secondary manner students will learn skills that would normally be taught in a formal setting in the more interesting and engaging environment of social learning. Sites like Twitter provide students with the opportunity to converse and collaborate with others in real time. Social networking services provide a virtual space for learners.

Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning educator professional development and content sharing. Ning for teachers TermWiki Learn Central TeachStreet and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs eportfolios formal and ad hoc communities as well as communication such as chats discussion threads and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features.

Laureate Education Inc. s U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009 0311658 A1 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference discloses System And Method For Collaborative Development Of Online Courses And Programs Of Study over a social network. A database stores an initial framework that defines a sequence of learning units for creating a desired learning environment for students. The learning units are identified by corresponding learning unit identifiers. A plurality of workstations coupled to the network are used for entry of reviewer information by the participants using the learning environment created for the students. The reviewer information comprise one or more comments entered by one participant about a learning unit and a rank entered by another participant about the comment with the rank being correlated with a defined ranking standard. A processor processes the rank according to a predefined criteria to produce a ranking result that is associated with a learning unit identifier. The ranking result is used for associating learning content to the learning unit identified by the learning unit identifier.

Laureate Education Inc. s U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2009 0291426 A1 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference discloses an Educational System For Presenting One Or More Learning Units To Students In Different Learning Environments where each unit is associated with an assessment information relating to students. A digital rights and asset management application controls access to the content associated with each one of said one or more units according to corresponding unit identifiers. An assessment application e.g. a grade book application stores assessment information derived from presenting the content to said one or more users in the first and second interactive environments including social networks with the unit identifier correlating the assessment information with the units.

Social networking sites share a variety of technical features that allow individuals to construct a public semi public profile articulate a list of other users that they share a connection with and view their list of connections within the system. The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of friends who are also users of the site. A profile is generated from answers to questions such as age location interests etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others e.g. Facebook allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or Applications. Many sites allow users to post blog entries search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile contact them add them to their list of contacts and so on. Some social networks have additional features such as the ability to create groups that share common interests or affiliations upload or stream live videos and hold discussions in forums.

Companies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions such as cloud computing with social networking concepts. Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences. Many provide specialized networking tools and applications that can be accessed via their websites such as LinkedIn. Others companies such as Monster.com have been steadily developing a more socialized feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites. These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are Vocational Networking Sites or Vocational Media Networks with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.

An activity stream is a list of recent activities performed by an individual typically on a single website. For example Facebook s News Feed is an activity stream. When users are logged into Facebook a News Feed presents constantly updated list of their friends Facebook activity. The News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes upcoming events and birthdays among other updates. The News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user s friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed a news stream on the user s profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. News Feed shows top stories and most recent stories in one feed and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories as well as to un highlight stories. The News Feed allow users to view recent stories first.

Since the proliferation of activity streams on websites there have been calls to standardize the format so that websites could interact with a stream provided by another website. The Activity Streams project for example is an effort to develop an activity stream protocol to syndicate activities across social Web applications. Activity Streams is an open format specification for activity stream protocols which are used to syndicate activities taken in social web applications and services similar to those in Facebook Newsfeed FriendFeed the Movable Type Action Streams plugin etc. Several major websites with activity stream implementations have already opened up their activity streams to developers to use including Facebook and MySpace. Facebook Desktop for Adobe AIR lets users see a running timeline or stream of the activities of their friends on a desktop computer or even on a cell phone. Though activity stream arises from social networking nowadays it has become an essential part of business software. Enterprise social software is used in different types of companies to organize their internal communication and acts as an important addition to traditional corporate intranet. Such major collaboration software like Jive Software Yammer or Chatter offer activity stream as a separate product. At the same time other major software providers such as tibbr Central Desktop and Wrike offer activity stream as an integrated part of their collaboration software solution.

With advances in information technologies there exists a need for an educational system that allows geographically dispersed students to communicate messages with each other based on regional requirements.

Briefly according to the present invention a learning management system and method displays corresponding learning environments for delivery of instructional material to a plurality of geographically dispersed remote student workstations located in a plurality of regions after the learning system authenticates a corresponding plurality of students at the plurality of geographically dispersed remote student workstations. Each learning environment displays a user interface on a respective remote student workstation located in one region of the plurality of regions. At least one region profile stores information specifying a rule associated with communication of information between a first region and another second region. Messages are communicated amongst the geographically dispersed remote student workstations located in the plurality of regions in accordance with the region profile.

According to some of the more detailed features of the invention the rule prevents communication of a message between a first student in a first course and a second student in a second course or between a first student in a first region and a second student in a second region or between a first student of a first educational institution and a second student of a second educational institution or between a student over a certain age and a student under the certain age or between a first country and a second country.

According to other more detailed features of the invention the rule causes a message in a first language of a first region to be translated into a second language of a second region for example using a machine translation technique.

According to other more detailed features of the invention the message includes a message from a student or a message to a student or a student profile or a status of a student or a stream update or an instructional material.

The system may also include features for enabling users to identify contacts of their respective contacts. In addition the system may automatically notify users of personal information updates made by their respective contacts.

A network service comprises a platform that builds a plurality of networks of related users. Such network service platform may be presented to the users via a website served by servers such as those disclosed in connection with . Network services allow for creation of user profile pages that may include pictures and user information.

The users may be related based on shared interests in learning a subject. For example the related users can be students taking the same course or classes. The related users can comprise students and faculty responsible for mediating instructional material for a course of study. The related users can be students having shared interest in learning about a specific subject that is offered by a learning institution or various learning activities. The related users can comprise students and other users that have real life connections with the students. Such real life connections can be based on friendship ethnical backgrounds etc.

A learning management system may comprise a database a learning system and a networking service. The database such as any one or more of those depicted in or otherwise described herein may store electronic addresses for a plurality of contacts associated with the student. The student s contacts may be any other system user that is associated with the user. As discussed above a user s contact may be in a community with the user a circle with the user a course with the user or any combination thereof. A student may be associated with a set of student s contacts i.e. contacts of the student. The set of student s contacts may comprise at least one student selected contact and at least one mandatory contact. The student selected contact may be a contact designated by the student to be in the set of the student s contacts. For example the student selected contact may a member of a circle of the student another user added by the student to the student s contact list or any other contact otherwise identified by the student as the student s contact. In some embodiments the student selected contact may a member of a contact group that is subject to a group approval such as a community.

The mandatory contact may be a contact that is not designated by the student to be in the set of the student s contacts but is still one of the student s contacts. For example a mandatory contact may be a classmate that is enrolled in the same course with the student a course instructor assigned to the course an assessor of student performance of the course a course developer assigned to a course a member of a contact group that is subject to group approval e.g. a member of a community or any other contact not selected designated and or identified by the student to be in the set of student s contacts. Courses as a type of association of contacts may refer to groups of connected users e.g. students teachers teaching assistants that are involved in the same course. Membership in a course may be mandatory in that any person involved with a course may automatically be included in the course group and the user may not have the ability to opt out of the course group. Similarly a mandatory contact or compulsory contact of the student may be automatically included in the student s contacts and the student may not be able to remove the mandatory contact from the student s contacts. The identification selection or assignment of mandatory contacts of a student e.g. members of a course group may be provided by a registrar another source of course enrollment data or any other source on the system.

The learning system may be configured to deliver one or more instructional materials to the student. The one or more instructional materials may be any of those discussed herein.

The networking service may be in communication with the learning management system and the networking service may be configured to provide a user interface that enables the student to communicate messages with the student selected contact and the mandatory contact. The user interface may be any of those depicted herein e.g. interfaces provided for chatting posting updates etc.

In some embodiments the user interface may enable the student to selectively communicate messages with the student selected contact and mandatory contact during a learning session. For example a user may send or receive messages updates chats feed information status updates presence updates or any other communication from the student selected contact and or the mandatory contact during a learning session. For example the communications could be the updates depicted in .

In some embodiments the one or more instructional materials are associated with a course of study and the mandatory contact is associated with a course contact. For example the mandatory contact may be associated with another student taking the course a course instructor assigned to the course an assessor of student performance in the course a course developer assigned to the course or any combination thereof.

A network computer system such as the ones described herein may include social networking features that allow students faculty or other users to communicate with one other while using other features provided by the system. When using the social networking services a user may receive updates about social networking contacts. Updates may include updates on other users chat statuses or new information associated with other people. The updates may be displayed as a stream. In some embodiments the updates may appear as a live stream i.e. in which new updates are displayed as they occur on a real time basis or where users activities are streamed as soon as they happen. A stream may display for each update the source of the update who posted the updated the time of the update a message a content item or any combination thereof. The stream may be displayed while users are interacting with other parts of the system.

Because a stream may include an overwhelming amount of information the items of a stream may be filtered. As discussed herein a user may have the option of filtering updates in the stream to include only those updates meeting specified criteria such as membership in one or more courses circles communities.

Additionally or alternatively smart filtering may also be used in which filtering is performed automatically by the system based on a user s interactions.

In the learning management system a server configured to create a learning environment on a remote student workstation or accessible by a remote workstation for delivery of instructional material to a student after the server authenticates a student log in. The created learning environment displays a user interface to the student on the remote student workstation such as the interfaces described herein. The user interface may also be used to interact with an instructional material when the student enters into a learning session associated with a course. The learning session may refer to when a student interacts with an instructional material. If the student does not interact with instructional material then there is no learning session. which will be described in more detail below depicts an example of a learning session in which instructional materials are presented to a student and the student interacts with the instructional material.

A database such as any of those discussed herein may store electronic addresses for a plurality of contacts associated with the student. The plurality of contacts may comprise any of the contact types disclosed herein. The student may be associated with a set of student s contacts comprising a first contact associated with the first course and a second contact.

A networking service in communication with the server may be configured to display to the student within the learning environment a first activity stream associated with the first contact and a second activity stream associated with the second contact wherein upon detection of student s entry into the learning session the first activity stream is displayed without displaying the second activity stream. For example a user may be enrolled in and receive activity stream updates from contacts in four classes. The system may detect that a user is currently working on a lessons for a first class and based on that information remove from the activity stream updates from the other three classes. When the user later switches to working on lessons for a second class updates from the first class may be removed from being displayed and the activity stream updates from the second class may be displayed to the user. Although in this example the second activity stream is associated with a second class the second activity stream may be any activity stream. For example the activity stream may correspond to updates from a community a circle or any other organizational structure recognized by the system.

Many possible configurations for displaying the activity streams are possible. For example upon detection of the student s exit from the learning session e.g. the student leaves the instructional material to visit a different class or group the second activity stream may be displayed. The second activity stream may be displayed concurrently with the displaying of the first activity stream e.g. after the user exited the learning session the user s contacts associated with learning session may be displayed with all of the other contacts of the student. Alternatively the second activity stream may displayed without displaying the first activity stream. The first activity stream may comprises a first message from the first contact the second activity stream may comprises a second message from the second contact or any combination thereof. At least one of the first activity stream or second activity stream may comprises a message transmitted from the student. The first activity stream may comprise a first status update from the first contact the second activity stream may comprise a second status update from the second contact or any combination thereof.

The instructional material may be concurrently displayed with the first activity stream. For example the user may view the activity stream of updates from classmates displayed on an interface while interacting with instructional materials e.g. a lecture presentation etc. that are also displayed on the interface.

The first contact may be associated with another course student a course instructor a course performance assessor a course developer or a course administrator. The second contact may be associated with a student selected contact. At least one of the first or second activity streams may comprise a live stream in which updates are received in a real time basis as they occur. A message corresponding to the second activity stream is transmitted to the student upon detection of student s exit from the learning session.

In some embodiments a server such as any of those discussed herein may be configured to create a first learning environment on a remote student workstation or accessible by a remote student workstation for delivery of a first instructional material to a student after the server authenticates a student log in and a second learning environment on the remote student workstation or accessible on the remote student workstation for delivery of a second instructional material to the student after the server authenticates the student log in. The created first learning environment may display a first user interface to the student on the remote student workstation. The first user interface may be used to interact with the first instructional material when the student enters into a first learning session associated with the first course. The created second learning environment may display a second user interface to the student on the remote student workstation. The second user interface may be used to interact with the second instructional material when the student enters into a second learning session associated with a second course.

A database such as any of those discussed herein may store electronic addresses for a plurality of contacts associated with the student. The student may be associated with a set of student s contacts comprising a first contact associated with the first course and a second contact associated with the second course. For example the first contact may be a classmate of the student in the first course and the second contact may be an instructor of the student in the second course. However the first and second contacts could be any type of contact associated with the first and second courses respectively.

A networking service in communication with the server may be configured to display to the student within the first learning environment a first activity stream associated with the first contact and configured to display to the student within the second learning environment a second activity stream associated with the second contact. Upon detection of student s entry into the first learning session the first activity stream may be displayed without displaying the second activity stream and upon detection of student s entry into the second learning session the second activity stream may be displayed without displaying the first activity stream.

This type of filtering may be implemented according to one or more of the following configurations. In some embodiments the first activity stream may comprise a first message transmitted from the first contact the second activity streams comprises a second message transmitted from the second contact or any combination thereof. The first message may be transmitted from the first contact to the student the second message may be transmitted from the second contact to the student or any combination thereof. A message corresponding to the second activity stream may be transmitted to the student upon detection of student s exit from the learning session. At least one of the first activity stream or second activity stream may comprise a message transmitted from the student. The first activity stream may comprise a first status update from the first contact the second activity stream comprises a second status update from the second contact or any combination thereof. The first instructional material may be concurrently displayed with the first activity stream the second instructional material may be concurrently displayed with the second activity stream or any combination thereof. The first contact may be associated with another first course student a first course instructor a first course performance assessor a first course developer or a first course administrator. The second contact may be associated with a second course student a second course instructor a second course performance assessor a second course developer or a second course administrator. The first activity stream may comprise a live stream the second activity stream or comprise a live stream or any combination thereof.

Either type of filtering i.e. filtering by the student or filtering by the system may allow the system to avoid sending updates or buddy lists that are not being used because the updates or users have been filtered out. As a result the system may avoid sending extraneous data regarding updates that the user will not even see.

The created learning environment may display a user interface such as any of those described herein to the student on the remote student workstation. The user interface may be used to interact with an instructional material when the student enters into a learning session associated with a course.

A networking service in communication with the server may communicate messages to or from the student from within the learning environment. The messages may comprise any type of communication or message include any of those or any combination of those described herein. The communication of messages with the student may be monitored to determine whether a message contains an unauthorized content. Unauthorized content may be any item specified by the system as content that is not authorized to be transmitted. Not being authorized may be depended on the content itself the potential recipient of the content or message the transmitter of the content or message or any combination thereof.

Several possible actions may be taken by the system after detecting unauthorized content in messages. The message containing the unauthorized content may be deleted the message containing the unauthorized content may be redacted the unauthorized content may be deleted from the message prior to being received by the recipient the unauthorized content may be redacted from the message prior to being received by the recipient or any combination thereof.

Upon detection of an unauthorized content an alert message may be transmitted. For example an alert message may be transmitted to an instructor associated with the course an assessor associated with the course a faculty member associated with the course a course developer associated with the course a or any combination thereof. Additionally or alternatively the alert may be transmitted to the student.

The alert may contain one or more of the following the unauthorized content the identity of the sender the identity of the intended recipient the identity of any user that may have been exposed to the message and or unauthorized content or time and or date of the communication.

An online learning management system such as any of those described herein may provide courses to users. The courses may be structured to have particular learning activities performed by the users by particular deadlines e.g. turning in homework by a certain time taking a test before a certain date completing reading assignments etc. In order to provide flexibility in implementing courses with potentially varying start dates the system may include a course framework that includes relative deadlines for when tasks are due. The course frameworks may resemble those used in the master course model of developing courses. For example a relative deadline may specify that a particular homework assignment is due on the third day of the second week of the course. When a user begins a course or a course start date is otherwise determined the system may transform the relative dates into specific dates. For example given a course start date of Jan. 6 2013 the system may translate the relative date mentioned above into Jan. 15 2013. The system may then provide the course using the specific dates. Course materials with specific dates may also be provided to users as a calendar e.g. an .ics calendar file. When transforming relative dates into specific dates the system may schedule around potential conflicts such as holidays weekends breaks designated reading periods or any other date specified. For example the framework may recognize that certain dates fall on or after July 4 and then move each of those dates on or after July 4 ahead one day.

For example when an individual instructor creates an online course he she can specify exact dates when assignments are due. When online courses are centrally created and used for up to 5 years and when those courses are re used in multiple classrooms over multiple terms due dates become far more complicated. The system may be able to calculate learning activity due dates based on the following values term start date the number of weeks after term start on which the learning activity is due the number of days after the beginning of the week on which the learning activity is due or any combination thereof.

The system may be capable of displaying the learning activity due dates in a calendar format within the Learning Management System. This system may also be capable of generating calendar files that could be exported to the student s preferred calendaring system such as Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar.

In some embodiments a learning management system may comprise a database and a learning system such as those discussed herein. The database may store a framework e.g. a course framework. The framework may comprise a sequence of learning units that are associated with a reference calendar for completion of the learning activity relative to a reference date. The reference calendar may specify a reference due date for completing a learning activity associated with a learning unit of the sequence of learning units in which the reference due date is relative to the reference date. For example as discussed above a learning activity may be associated with a reference due date of the second week of a course. A learning activity may be an assignment associated with a learning unit.

The learning system may be configured to display a learning environment for delivery of instructional material associated with the sequence of learning units to a remote student workstation after the learning system authenticates a student at the remote student workstation. The displayed learning environment comprises a user interface displayed to the student e.g. any of the user interfaces described herein. The user interface may display an actual due date for completing the learning activity in which the actual due date is derived from the reference due date.

Deriving the actual due date from the reference due date may be determined in various ways. The actual due date may be determined by adding or subtracting the period of time between the reference due date from the reference date of the reference calendar to the reference date of the actual calendar to arrive at the actual date. Referring to actual calendar may include a plurality of dates including reference date actual due date date actual due date and date . The dates of actual calendar may be real calendar dates. For example date may correspond to Jul. 4 2013 date may correspond to Jul. 5 2013 and so on. Reference date may correspond to the beginning of reference calendar i.e. . Actual due date may be determined to be the date that is the same amount of time from reference date as reference due date is away from date .

In some embodiments the determined actual due date may be modified based on a an adjustment date. The actual due date may be based on an adjustment date on an actual calendar. For example the adjustment date may be based on a least one of a day of a week a day of a month or a day of the year. For example the day of a week may be the fifth day of the week a Tuesday etc. A day of a month may be the fifth day of the month the second Tuesday of the month the first day of the second week of the month etc. Similarly a day of the year may be specified using any technique for identifying a day during the year.

The adjustment date may be used in various ways. An adjustment date may specify that a particular day is not to available for scheduling an actual due date. For example if a relative due date after being paired with a starting date would result in the actual due date landing on a holiday e.g. July 4 then specifying July 4 as an adjustment date may result in the actual date being scheduled on a different day e.g. July 3 or July 5. In one or more embodiments an adjustment date may be removed consideration as an actual due date when determining the actual due date.

Referring again to date may be an adjustment date. Adjustment date may be a holiday e.g. July 4. Adjustment date may be determined to be the date that is the same amount of time from reference date as reference due date is away from date . However because adjustment date is a holiday and is specified as an adjustment date the assignment corresponding to reference due date will not be assigned to . Instead the learning activity corresponding to reference due date may be mapped to actual due date .

The adjustment date may comprise a holiday on the actual calendar a weekend day or any other date specified as such. The adjustment date may be based on at least one of a day of a week a day of a month or a day of the year. The adjustment date may be specified by a system administrator a course instructor a course developer or any combination thereof.

In the learning management system the set of learning activities may be associated with a course in which the reference calendar defines a reference course completion time period and in which the user interface displays an actual course completion time period derived from the reference course completion time period. For example the reference course completion period may be the period on reference calendar from reference date to reference due date and the actual course completion time period may be the period on actual calendar from reference date to actual due date .

Further the course completion time period may be between a reference course start date and a reference course end date in which the user interface displays at least one of an actual course start date or an actual course end date derived from a respective one of the reference course start date and the reference course end date. For example the reference course start date may be the reference course end date may be reference date the actual course start date may be reference date on actual calendar and the actual course completion end date may be date .

Moreover the course completion time period may be divided into a temporal sequence of reference learning unit completion sub periods. Each reference learning unit sub period in the temporal sequence may be associated with a corresponding learning unit in the sequence of learning units. The user interface may display an actual learning unit sub period derived from a reference learning unit sub period. For example the period from reference due date to reference date may be reference learning unit sub period. The period from actual due date to date of actual calendar may be an actual learning unit sub period derived from the reference learning unit sub period.

Deriving the actual learning unit sub period from the reference learning unit sub period or the actual course completion time period from the reference course completion time period may be performed in various ways including any of the techniques discussed herein such as those discussed in reference to deriving an actual due date from a reference due date.
