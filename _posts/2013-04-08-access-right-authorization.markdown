The specification relates to authorizing access right between users in social network systems or messaging systems.

Over the last decades internet has become increasingly popular. Users communicate with each other using systems relying on internet technologies. Sometimes users may desire to authorize other users access rights to act in the online systems on behalf of them. For example a first user and second user share a computer or phone device. The first user may want the second user to comment on a post with an online social network service on behalf of the first user. Some existing systems may not provide functionality regarding this requirement and the second user has to write in the content of the comment that this comment is actually from the first user. However this may be confusing to readers and this may cause inaccuracy when counting users activities. Other existing systems may allow the first user and second user to link their accounts to accomplish the authorization which however requires a higher level of trust and control between each other not limited to commenting on posts and requires a period of time for the systems to prepare the linking between the two accounts.

According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure a system for suggesting authorization of access right between users includes a processor and a memory storing instructions that when executed cause the system to determine a first user based at least in part on one or more user interactions associated with the first user the first user having a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the first user determine one or more second users as authorization candidates for the first user based on the one or more user interactions associated with the first user generate suggestion data recommending the first user to authorize the one or more second users an access right to act on the behalf of the first user provide the suggestion data to the first user and responsive to the first user authorizing the one or more second users the access right to act on the behalf of the first user update an account setting for the first user describing the authorization of the access right to the one or more second users.

In general another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in methods that include determining a first user based at least in part on one or more user interactions associated with the first user the first user having a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the first user determining one or more second users as authorization candidates for the first user based on the one or more user interactions associated with the first user generating suggestion data recommending the first user to authorize the one or more second users an access right to act on the behalf of the first user providing the suggestion data to the first user and responsive to the first user authorizing the one or more second users the access right to act on the behalf of the first user updating an account setting for the first user describing the authorization of the access right to the one or more second users.

Other aspects include corresponding methods systems apparatus and computer program products for these and other innovative aspects.

These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instances the operations further include receiving a request for a third user commenting on a post on behalf of the first user determining whether the post has been shared with the first user responsive to the determination that the post has been shared with the first user determining whether the first user has an access right to comment on the post responsive to the determination that the first user has the access right to comment on the post determining whether the third user has an access right to comment on behalf of the first user based at least in part on the account setting for the first user and responsive to the determination that the third user has the access right to comment on behalf of the first user sending an authorization signal receiving a submission signal indicating that the third user has submitted a comment responding to the post generating a first notification for the first user including the comment and sending the first notification to the first user receiving an edit on the comment from the third user updating a version index for the edited comment generating a second notification for the first user including the edited comment and sending the second notification to the first user receiving an indication from the first user that the first user has approved the comment and determining graphical data for displaying the comment responding to the post.

For instance the features include the first user and the one or more second users sharing one or more electronic devices including a computer and a phone and the suggestion data recommending the first user to authorize the one or more second users the access right to comment on a post on the behalf of the first user.

The present disclosure may be particularly advantageous in a number of respects. First the system may allow users who share computer devices to authorize each other certain access rights regarding their social accounts and their social activities with a social network service. Second the system may allow users to only authorize social abilities e.g. ability to comment on posts ability to publish new posts etc. to other users without letting them know private account information. Third the system may also provide useful information about links between users or accounts. For example the advertisement agents can take advantage of the useful information when promoting products to the users or accounts.

The user devices in can be used by way of example. While illustrates two user devices and the present disclosure applies to a system architecture having one or more user devices . Furthermore although illustrates one network coupled to the user devices the social network server the third party server the account server and the advertisement server in practice one or more networks can be connected to these entities. Furthermore while includes one social network server one third party server one account server and one advertisement server the architecture could include one or more social network servers one or more third party servers one or more account servers and one or more advertisement servers .

The network can be a conventional type wired or wireless and may have numerous different configurations including a star configuration token ring configuration or other configurations. Furthermore the network may include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and or other interconnected data paths across which multiple devices may communicate. In some implementations the network may be a peer to peer network. The network may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In some implementations the network includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data including via short messaging service SMS multimedia messaging service MMS hypertext transfer protocol HTTP direct data connection WAP email etc.

The social network server can be a hardware server that includes a processor a memory and network communication capabilities. In the illustrated implementation the social network server is coupled to the network via signal line . The social network server sends and receives data to and from one or more of the user devices the third party server the account server and the advertisement server via the network . The social network server includes a social network application . A social network can be a type of social structure where the users may be connected by a common feature. The common feature includes relationships connections e.g. friendship family work an interest etc. The common features may be provided by one or more social networking systems including explicitly defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users where the relationships form a social graph. In some examples the social graph can reflect a mapping of these users and how they can be related. Furthermore it should be understood that the social network server and the social network application can be representative of one social network and that there may be multiple social networks coupled to the network each having its own server application and social graph. For example a first social network may be more directed to business networking a second may be more directed to or centered on academics a third may be more directed to local business a fourth may be directed to dating and others may be of general interest or a specific focus. In some implementations the social network includes a service that provides a social feed describing one or more activities of a user . For example the social feed includes one or more status updates for the user describing the user s actions thoughts opinions etc. In some implementations the social network application can be stored and executed on one of the third party server and the account server . In some implementations the service provided by the social network application is referred to as a social network service. Other implementations can be possible. In some implementations the services and components of the third party server social network server and account server can be provided by the same one or more servers. Moreover the separation of various components and servers in the implementations described herein should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations and it should be understood that the described components and servers can generally be integrated together in a single component or server.

In some implementations the social network server includes an optional application programming interface API . The API can include code and routines for handling data communication among different entities. For example the optional API can be stored in the social network server and includes code and routines for handling data communication between the social network server and the account server . In the illustrated implementation the API is depicted using a dashed line to indicate that the API may be an optional feature for the social network server .

In some implementations the social network server also includes a suggestion application also referred to herein individually and collectively as . In some implementations the suggestion application can be stored on the account server . For example the suggestion application can be stored on the account server which is connected to the network via signal line . In some implementations the suggestion application can be included in the third party server . For example the suggestion application can be stored in the third party server . In some implementations the suggestion application can be stored on a user device . For example the suggestion application can be stored in the user device which is connected to the network via signal line . It should be understood that the suggestion application can be stored in one of the devices and servers or in a combination of the devices and servers.

The suggestion application can be code and routines for suggesting an authorization of an access right between users . In some implementations the suggestion application can be implemented using hardware including a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC . In some other instances the suggestion application can be implemented using a combination of hardware and software. In some implementations the suggestion application may be stored in a combination of the devices and servers or in one of the devices or servers.

In some implementations the suggestion application determines a first user based at least in part on activity data associated with the first user including session data and interaction data describing one or more user interactions associated with the first user . The first user has a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the first user . For example the first user shares an electronic device e.g. a computer a phone etc. with a second user and may have a desire to authorize the second user to act on behalf of the first user . In some instances the first user may be an executive officer or a celebrity who may be busy and need an assistant to act on behalf of the first user . In some instances the first user enjoys online role playing games with other second users in a closed online community e.g. an online community of high school students. In some implementations the session data may include browser cookies.

In some implementations the suggestion application determines one or more second users as authorization candidates for the first user based on the activity data associated with the first user . In some instances an authorization candidate can be a proxy for a first user who is determined to have a potential for authorizing the proxy to act on behalf of the first user . For example the suggestion application determines one or more second users who share computer with the first user as one or more proxies for the first user . In some instances the one or more second users may be assistants for the first user who is a celebrity or a chef executive officer. In some instances the one or more second users may play role playing games with the first user in a closed online community. In some implementations the suggestion application determines a set of one or more proxies from the social graph provided by the social network server . For example the one or more proxies have registered social accounts with the social network server . The suggestion application determines a set of one or more proxies based on the social accounts so that the first user can choose from and authorize. In some instances the set of one or more proxies for the first user can be a proxy circle for the first user including one or more social network users who have social accounts with the social network server . In some instances the set of one or more proxies for the first user can be a circle of social network users who are connected to the first user by the social graph. For example the suggestion application determines a proxy circle including social connections for the first user e.g. friends family followers etc. so that the first user can choose to authorize.

The suggestion application generates suggestion data and provides the suggestion data to the first user for recommending the first user to authorize the one or more second users an access right to act on the behalf of the first user . For example the suggestion application determines graphical data for displaying a user interface that provides the suggestion data to the first user . Responsive to the first user authorizing the one or more second users the access right to act on the behalf of the first user the suggestion application updates an account setting for the first user describing the authorization of the access right to the one or more second users . For example the first user may accept the suggestion displayed in the user interface by clicking an authorize button via the user device . Upon the first user s acceptance the suggestion application can configure the account setting for the first user allowing the one or more second users to act on behalf of the first user . In some instances the suggestion data can describe a proxy circle including one or more second users e.g. proxies for the first user . The first user can be provided a user interface to authorize the proxy circle to act on behalf of the first user . The suggestion application can configure the account setting for the first user authorizing the one or more second users in the proxy circle upon consent of the first user . Therefore the one or more second users in the proxy circle can act on behalf of the first user upon an approval of the first user on the social actions of the one or more second users . In some implementations the first user can be provided a user interface to modify the proxy circle authorized by the first user . For example the first user can dynamically add via the user interface a new second user into the proxy circle so that the new second user is able to act on behalf of the first user . In some instances the first user can dynamically remove a second user from the proxy circle to take back the authorization to the second user without any effect on other second users in the proxy circle. In some instances the first user specifies the account setting via the user interface and the suggestion application updates the account setting based at least in part on first user s specification. The suggestion application will be described in further detail below with reference to and A B.

One significant benefit for authorizing one or more proxies as described herein can be allowing a first user to authorize a second user to act on behalf of the first user without disclosing credential information of the first user to the second user . For example the second user logs in a social account with the social network using credential information of the second user and interacts with social services on behalf of the first user without knowing credential information of the first user e.g. a user name of the first user a user identifier for the first user a login password for the first user etc. . By allowing the second user to act on behalf of the first user using the second user s own account the first user can highly control social actions on behalf of the first user acted by the second user via reviewing and approving or rejecting the social actions. The review and approval rejection process will be implemented by the authorization application which will be described below with further detail.

In some implementations the social network server also includes an authorization application also referred to herein individually and collectively as . In some implementations the authorization application can be stored on the account server . For example the authorization application can be stored on the account server which is connected to the network via signal line . In some implementations the authorization application can be included in the third party server . For example the authorization application can be stored in the third party server . In some implementations the authorization application can be stored on a user device . For example the authorization application can be stored in the user device . It should be understood that the authorization application can be stored in one of the devices and servers or in a combination of the devices and servers.

The authorization application can be code and routines for authorizing a second user to act on behalf of a first user upon consent of the first user . In some implementations the authorization application can be implemented using hardware including a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC . In some other instances the authorization application can be implemented using a combination of hardware and software. In some implementations the authorization application may be stored in a combination of the devices and servers or in one of the devices or servers.

In some implementations the authorization application receives a request for a second user commenting on a post on behalf of the first user . For example a second user logs in a social network service provided by a social network application via a user device and types in an edit box for commenting on a post on behalf of the first user causing the authorization application to receive via a network the request for the second user commenting on a post on behalf of the first user from the user device . The authorization application determines whether the post has been shared with the first user . For example the post has been submitted by a third user who shares the post with a group of friends. The authorization application determines whether the first user may be one of the friends. Responsive to the determination that the post has been shared with the first user the authorization application determines whether the first user has an access right to comment on the post. For example the third user allows one or more friends in the group of friends to comment on the post. The authorization application determines whether the first user may be among the one or more friends who may be allowed to comment on the post. Responsive to the determination that the first user has the access right to comment on the post the authorization application determines whether the second user has an access right to comment on behalf of the first user based at least in part on the account setting for the first user . For example the authorization application retrieves the account setting for the first user including an authorization setting parses the authorization setting and determines whether the first user allows the second user to comment on posts on behalf of the first user . Responsive to the determination that the second user has the access right to comment on behalf of the first user the authorization application generates and sends an authorization signal to one or more of the social network application the third party server and the user device . The authorization application will be described in further detail below with reference to FIGS. and A C.

Other examples of services provided by the service module include but not limited to providing a news feed publishing an article generating a playlist publishing a video posting a picture or other online services. In some implementations a user interacts with a service provided by the service module. The service module generates user activity data describing the user interaction with the service. For example a user comments on a news article presented on a web page provided by the service module causing the service module to generate user activity data describing that the user has commented on the news article. The service module sends the user activity data to the suggestion application for identifying a first user who has a potential for authorizing other users access rights. In some implementations the service module stores the user activity data in the storage . In some implementations the service module can be stored and executed on one of the social network server and the account server . The service provided by the service module can be referred to as a first service.

In some implementations the storage stores account data associated with one or more users . For example the account data describes one or more account settings. In some instances an account setting for a first user can include an authorization setting enabling one or more second users to act on behalf of the first user . For example the authorization setting indicates that the first user allows a list of second users to comment on existing posts on behalf of the first user . In some instances the authorization setting indicates that the first user does not allow other users to publish a new post or message on behalf of the first user . In some implementations the suggestion application may provide options for configuring account settings to users .

The user device may be a computing device that includes a memory and a processor for example a laptop computer a desktop computer a tablet computer a mobile telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile email device a portable game player a portable music player a television with one or more processors embedded therein or coupled thereto or other electronic device capable of accessing a network .

In some instances the first controller receives via the communication unit activity data associated with a user from one or more of the user device the social network server and the third party server . In some instances the first controller receives graphical data for providing a user interface that displays suggestions to a user from the first user interface module and sends via the communication unit the graphical data to a user device causing the user device to present the user interface displaying the suggestions to the user . In some instances the first controller receives via the communication unit a user indication responding to the suggestions from the user device and delivers the user indication to one or more appropriate components of the suggestion application e.g. the first determination module .

In some implementations the first controller receives data from components of the suggestion application and stores the data in the storage . For example the first controller receives suggestion data describing one or more suggestions for a user from the identification module and stores the suggestion data in the storage . In some implementations the first controller retrieves data from the storage and sends the data to components of the suggestion application . For example the first controller retrieves account data describing account settings for a user from the storage and sends the account data to the update module for updating the account settings for the user .

The identification module can be software including routines for identifying a potential authorizer and one or more candidate users to be recommended to the potential authorizer .

In some implementations the identification module cooperates with the first controller to retrieves activity data associated with users from one or more of the user device the social network server and the third party server . In some instances the activity data associated with users includes session data and interaction data describing one or more user interactions associated with the users . For example the session data includes one or more browser cookies describing a user browsing a website. A user interaction describes a user action regarding a service provided by one or more of the social network server and the third party server . For example a user interaction describes that a first user comments on a post submitted by a second user . In some implementations other activity data associated with users may be possible. In some implementations the identification module parses the activity data and determines a first user as a potential authorizer based at least in part on the activity data. In some instances a potential authorizer may have a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the potential authorizer . For example the identification module determines by parsing one or more browser cookies that a first user shares an electronic device e.g. a computer a phone etc. with a second user and may have a desire to authorize the second user to act e.g. comment on posts publish new posts etc. on behalf of the first user . In some instances a potential authorizer may be an executive or a celebrity who may be busy and need an assistant to act on behalf of the potential authorizer . In some instances a potential authorizer enjoys online role playing games with other users in a closed online community e.g. an online community of high school students.

In some implementations identification module further determines one or more second users as authorization candidates to be recommended to the first user .

In some instances the one or more second users may be assistants for the first user . In some instances the one or more second users may play role playing games with the first user in a closed online community. In some implementations the identification module generates suggestion data recommending the first user to authorize an access right to the one or more second users to act on behalf of the first user . For example the suggestion data describes a second user to be recommended to the first user as a proxy for commenting on existing posts on behalf of the first user . In some implementations the identification module determines a set of one or more proxies from the social graph provided by the social network server . For example the one or more proxies have registered social accounts with the social network server . In some instance the one or more proxies can be social connections to the first user specified by the social graph provided by the social network server . In some implementations the identification module can form a proxy circle based on the set of one or more proxies for the first user .

In some implementations the identification module sends the suggestion data to the first user interface module for generating graphical data to display a user interface providing the suggestion data to the first user . In some implementations the identification module stores the suggestion data in the storage .

The first user interface module can be software including routines for generating graphical data for providing user interfaces. In some implementations the first user interface module can be a set of instructions executable by the first processor to provide the functionality described below for generating graphical data for providing user interfaces described below with reference to . In some instances the first user interface module can be stored in the first memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the first processor . The first user interface module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the first processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some implementations the first user interface module generates graphical data for providing a user interface that depicts one or more suggestions for a potential authorizer . The first user interface module sends the graphical data to a user device operated by the potential authorizer causing the user device to present the one or more suggestions to the potential authorizer via the user interface. For example the user interface displays a suggestion for recommending the potential authorizer to configure the account settings to allow a second user to act on behalf of the potential authorizer . In some instances the potential authorizer may accept the suggestion to authorize the second user the access right to act on behalf of the potential authorizer via the user interface. For example the potential authorizer may click on an authorize button on the user interface via the user device . In some instances the potential authorizer may dismiss the suggestion via the user interface. In some instances the potential authorizer may opt in or opt out from receiving such suggestions.

In some implementations the first user interface module generates graphical data for providing a user interface that allows a user to configure the account settings. For example the user interface allows a user to select different levels of authorization. In some instances the user interface allows a first user to select from denying other users to comment on or respond to existing posts on behalf of the first user authorizing other users the ability to comment on or respond to existing posts on behalf of the first user and or authorizing an access control list of certain second users to comment on or respond to existing posts on behalf of the first user . In some instances the user interface allows a first user to select from denying other users to publish a new post or message on behalf of the first user authorizing other users the ability to publish a new post or message on behalf of the first user and or authorizing an access control list of certain second users to publish a new post or message on behalf of the first user . Furthermore the first user can also specify the certain second users via the user interface. For example the first user can selects certain second users from the first user s social connections specified by the social graph e.g. friends family etc. . In some instance the first user can also specify whether to make the comments new posts and messages submitted by the second users on behalf of the first user visible without the approval of the first user . For example the first user can specify that the comments new posts and messages submitted by the second users on behalf of the first user may be visible even without the approval of the first user . For example the first user can specify that the comments new posts and messages submitted by the second users on behalf of the first user cannot be visible to other users without the approval of the first user .

The first determination module can be software including routines for determining whether the potential authorizer has agreed with the suggestions. In some implementations the first determination module can be a set of instructions executable by the first processor to provide the functionality described below for determining whether the potential authorizer has agreed with the suggestions. In some instances the first determination module can be stored in the first memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the first processor . The first determination module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the first processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some implementations the first determination module cooperates with the first controller receives via the communication unit a user input responding to the suggestion displayed in the user interface on the user device . For example the first user clicks an authorize button indicating that the first user accepts the suggestion of authorizing a second user an access right to act on behalf of the first user causing the first determination module receives via the communication unit and the first controller the user indication of authorizing the second user to act on behalf of the first user . In some instances the first user may choose to reject the suggestion and the first determination module receives an indication of rejection accordingly. The first determination module determines whether the first user has agreed with the suggestion based at least in part on the received user indication. If the first determination module determines that the first user has agreed with the suggestion of authorization the first determination module sends the determination to the update module . If the first determination module determines that the first user has not accepted the suggestion of authorization the first determination module sends a rejection signal to the update module .

In some instances the first user may select to opt out from receiving such suggestions causing the first determination module to receive via the first controller and the network an opt out input from the first user . The first determination module generates an opt out signal indicating not sending such suggestions to the first user and the first determination module sends the opt out signal to the identification module . The identification module may stop generating and sending such suggestions to the first user .

The update module can be software including routines for updating account settings for users . In some implementations the update module can be a set of instructions executable by the first processor to provide the functionality described below for updating account settings for users . In some instances the update module can be stored in the first memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the first processor . The update module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the first processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some implementations the update module receives a determination that a first user has agreed to authorize one or more second users an access right to act on behalf of the first user from the first determination module . In some implementations the update module also receives via the first controller a user input describing one or more authorization settings specified by the first user . For example as described above with reference to the first user interface module the first user may specify via a user interface a group of certain second users that may be social connections to the first user and indicates to allow the group of certain second users to comment on behalf of the first user . The update module receives the user input via the first controller . In some implementations the update module updates account settings for the first user based at least in part on the user input describing that the first user authorizes the group of certain second users access rights to comment on posts on behalf of the first user . For example the update module configures the account settings to specify that the group of certain second users has been authorized by the first user to comment on posts on behalf of the first user .

In some implementations the update module receive a user input specifying that the first user allows a group of certain second users to publish a new post or message on behalf of the first user . The update module configures the account settings for the first user accordingly.

In some implementations the update module updates a proxy circle for a first user based upon the first user s specification. For example if the first user indicates to add a new proxy into the proxy circle via a user interface the update module updates the account settings of the first user to allow the new proxy to act on behalf of the first user . In some instances if the first user indicates to remove an existing proxy in the proxy circle via a user interface the update module configures the account settings for the first user to deny the existing proxy to act on behalf of the first user anymore.

In some implementations the update module stores account data describing account settings for the first user in the storage . In some implementations the account data may be retrieved by the authorization application to determine that a second user has been authorized to act on behalf of a first user and to allow the second user to act as the first user .

Referring now to an example of the authorization application is shown in more detail. is a block diagram of a computing device that includes a second communication unit a second processor a second memory and a storage device according to some examples. The components of the computing device are communicatively coupled by a bus . In some implementations the computing device can be one of a social network server a user device a third party server and an account server .

The second communication unit second processor and second memory provide similar functionality as described above for the first communication unit the first processor and the first memory respectively. Accordingly these descriptions will not be repeated here. In the illustrated implementation the second communication unit is communicatively coupled to the bus via signal line the second processor is communicatively coupled to the bus via signal line and the second memory is communicatively coupled to the bus via signal line . The storage is described above with reference to and the description will not be repeated here. In the illustrated implementation the storage is communicatively coupled to the bus via signal line .

In the illustrated implementation shown in the authorization application includes a second controller an authentication module a notification module a second determination module a metadata module and a second user interface module . These components of the authorization application are communicatively coupled to each other via the bus .

The second controller can be software including routines for handling communications between the authorization application and other components of the computing device . In some implementations the second controller can be a set of instructions executable by the second processor to provide the functionality described below for handling communications between the authorization application and other components of the computing device . In some instances the second controller can be stored in the second memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the second processor . The second controller may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the second processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

The second controller sends and receives data via the second communication unit to and from one or more of a user device a social network server a third party server and an account server . In some instances the second controller receives via the second communication unit an authorization request for a first user commenting on a post as a second user from one or more of the social network server the user device and the third party server . In some instances the second controller sends via the second communication unit an authorization signal to one or more of the social network server the user device and the third party server for allowing the first user to act on behalf of the second user . In some instances the second controller receives via the second communication unit a submission signal from one or more of the social network server the user device and the third party server indicating that the first user submitted the activity on behalf of the second user . For example the submission signal indicates that the first user submitted a comment on behalf of the second user . In some instances the second controller receives a notification from the notification module and sends via the second communication unit the notification to one or more of the social network server the user device and the third party server for notifying the second user regarding the activity done by the first user on behalf of the second user . In some instances the second controller receives via the second communication unit a user input describing an approval decision of the second user for approving the activity from one or more of the social network server the user device and the third party server .

In some implementations the second controller receives data from other components of the authorization application and stores the data in the storage . For example the second controller receives metadata associated with the activities from the metadata module and stores the metadata in the storage . In some implementations the second controller retrieves data from the storage and sends the data to other components of the authorization application . For example the second controller retrieves account data describing account settings for the second user from the storage and sends the account data to the authentication module for determining whether the second user allows the first user to act on behalf of the second user .

The authentication module can be software including routines for determining whether a first user can act on behalf of a second user . In some implementations the authentication module can be a set of instructions executable by the second processor to provide the functionality described below for determining whether a first user can act on behalf of a second user . In some instances the authentication module can be stored in the second memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the second processor . The authentication module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the second processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some implementations the authentication module receives via the second controller login information of a first user from a user device upon the first user logging in a service. For example the service may be a social network service provided by the social network application . The service may also be a service provided by the third party server . In some implementations the authentication module receives via the second controller an authorization request for the first user acting on behalf of a second user . For example upon the first user selects an option in a user interface to comment on a post as a second user a user device providing the user interface receives the selection from the first user generates a request indicating that the first user requests to comment on behalf of the second user and sends the request to the authorization application . The authentication module receives via the second controller the request from the user device . In some instances an authorization request indicates that a first user requests to publish a new post or message on behalf of the second user .

In some implementations upon receiving an authorization request for a first user commenting on a post on behalf of a second user the authentication module determines whether the post has been also shared with the second user . For example a third user has published the post and shared the post with a group of other users including the first user . The authentication module determines whether the group of other users also includes the second user . If the authentication module determines that the third user has not shared the post with the second user the authentication module generates and sends a decline signal to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for not allowing the first user to comment on the post on behalf of the second user . In some implementations if the authentication module determines that the third user has also shared the post with the second user the authentication module determines whether the second user has an access right to comment on the post. For example the authentication module determines whether the author of the post e.g. the third user allows the second user to comment on the post.

In some implementations if the authentication module determines that the second user has an access right to comment on the post the authentication module retrieves via the second controller account data describing account settings for the second user from the storage and determines whether the account settings allow the first user an access right to comment on the post on the second user s behalf. Otherwise the authentication module generates and sends a decline signal to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for not allowing the first user to comment on the post on behalf of the second user . If the authentication module determines that the account settings allow the first user an access right to comment on the post on the second user s behalf the authentication module generates and sends an authorization signal to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for allowing the first user to comment on the post on behalf of the second user .

In some implementations the authentication module receives an authorization request for a first user publishing a new post or message on behalf of a second user . The authentication module retrieves via the second controller account data describing account settings for the second user from the storage and determines whether the account settings allow the first user an access right to publish a new post or message on the second user s behalf. If the authentication module determines that the account settings allow the first user an access right to publish a new post or message on the second user s behalf the authentication module generates and sends an authorization signal to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for allowing the first user to publish a new post or message on behalf of the second user . Otherwise the authentication module generates and sends a decline signal to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for not allowing the first user to publish a new post or message on behalf of the second user .

The notification module can be software including routines for generating notifications upon submission of user activities. In some implementations the notification module can be a set of instructions executable by the second processor to provide the functionality described below for generating notifications upon submission of user activities. In some instances the notification module can be stored in the second memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the second processor . The notification module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the second processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some implementations the notification module receives via the second controller a submission signal from one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device upon the first user submitting a comment on an existing post or submitting a new post or message on behalf of the second user . The comment at this stage can be referred to as an unapproved comment since the second user has not yet approved the comment submitted by the first user . Similarly the new post or message at this stage may be referred to as an unapproved post or message. In some implementations the unapproved comment can be visible to other users if the second user configures the account settings as making the unapproved comments visible without an approval by the second user . For example the unapproved comment may be clearly marked as such grayed out or with italics font etc. In some implementations if the second user configures the account settings as making the unapproved comments invisible without an approval by the second user the unapproved comment may be invisible to other users and only visible to the first user and the second user . In some implementations the second user can configure the account settings similarly regarding the unapproved new post or message. For example the second user can configure the account settings as making the unapproved new post or message visible without an approval by the user . For example the second user may configure the account settings as making the unapproved new post or message invisible without an approval by the user .

In some implementations the notification module generates a notification for the second user including the unapproved comment or the unapproved new post or message submitted by the first user upon receiving the submission signal. For example the notification may invite the second user to review the unapproved comment or the unapproved new post or message. The notification module sends the notification to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for displaying the notification to the second user upon the second user logging in the service.

In some implementations the notification module receives actions on the comment or new post or message from the first user during the unapproved stage. For example the notification module may receive an edit on the unapproved comment from the first user . For example the notification module may receive an indication that the first user takes back the unapproved comment. In some implementations upon receiving an edit on the unapproved comment the notification module generates and sends a new notification including the edit. The notification module also updates a version index for the unapproved comment. For example once the first user edits on the unapproved comment the notification module increases the version index by one. The notification module also stores and timely updates the version index and state of the comment in the storage . For example the state of the comment may include an unapproved state and an approved state. By doing this the notification module avoids concurrent approval of an unapproved comment with a stale version index.

In some implementations the notification module may receive an edit on the unapproved new post or message from the first user . For example the first user may modify the new post or message. In some instances the first user may take the new post or message back. Similarly the notification module generates and sends a new notification including the action of the first user . The notification module may also updates a version index for the modified new post or message and stores the updated version index and a state for the new post or message in the storage .

The second determination module can be software including routines for determining whether a user approves an action on behalf of the user . In some implementations the second determination module can be a set of instructions executable by the second processor to provide the functionality described below for determining whether a user approves an action on behalf of the user . In some instances the second determination module can be stored in the second memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the second processor . The second determination module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the second processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some implementations the second determination module receives via the second controller a user input describing a decision of the second user . For example the second user logs in and receives the notification including the unapproved comment submitted by the first user on behalf of the second user . The second user may review the unapproved comment and make a decision. For example the second user can approve reject edit or approve the comment. In some instances the second user can also report to the second determination module the first user making unwanted comments on the second user s behalf as a spammer. In some instances the second user can also block the first user from further commenting on existing posts publishing new posts or messages or from other communications. In some implementations the second user specifies the decision by a user input via a user interface. For example a user input may indicate that the second user has approved the comment submitted by the first user on behalf of the second user . In some instances a user input may indicate that second user has rejected the comment submitted by the first user on behalf of the second user .

In some implementations the second user receives a notification regarding an unapproved new post or message. Similarly the second user can approve reject edit or approve the new post or message. The second user can also report to the second determination module the first user publishing unwanted posts or messages on the second user s behalf as a spammer. In some implementations the second user may specify a decision regarding an unapproved post or message by a user input via a user interface. For example a user input may indicate that second user has approved the post or message submitted by the first user on behalf of the second user .

If the second determination module determines that the second user has approved the comment post or message submitted by the first user on behalf of the second user based at least in part on the user input the second determination module sends the approved comment post or message to the metadata module for generating metadata associated with the comment post or message. Otherwise the second determination module generates and sends a decline signal to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for not publishing the comment post or message on behalf of the second user .

In some implementations the second determination module also sends the approved comment post or message to the second user interface module for posting the comment post or message in a user interface. In some implementations the second determination module sends the approved comment post or message to one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device for posting the comment post or message in a corresponding service. For example the second determination module sends an approved comment to the social network server for including the approved comment in the second user s social feed with a social network service. In some implementations the approved comment can be deleted from the social feed depending upon the consent of the first user or the second user and upon the consent of the social network service. In some implementations the approved comment published by the first user on behalf of the second user may not be different to viewers from other comments published by the second user . In some implementations the approved comment may be displayed so that viewers can tell it may be published by the first user on behalf of the second user . For example information describing that the approved comment may be originally made by the first user can be made available along with the approved comment to viewers.

The metadata module can be software including routines for generating metadata associated with approved activities. In some implementations the metadata module can be a set of instructions executable by the second processor to provide the functionality described below for generating metadata associated with approved activities. In some instances the metadata module can be stored in the second memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the second processor . The metadata module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the second processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some implementations the metadata module receives approved activities and determines metadata associated with the approved activities. For example the metadata module receives an approved comment and determines metadata associated with the comment e.g. the author of the comment the user on whose behalf the comment has been published the version index etc. Similarly the metadata module may receive an approved post or message and determines metadata associated with the post or message e.g. the author of the post or message the user on whose behalf the post or message has been published the version index etc. The metadata module stores the metadata associated with the activities in the storage for future searching and legal purpose.

The second user interface module can be software including routines for generating graphical data for providing a graphical user interface to the user device . In some implementations the second user interface module can be a set of instructions executable by the second processor to generate graphical data for providing the user interfaces described below with reference to . The second user interface module sends the graphical data to a user device causing the user device to present the graphical user interface to the user . For example the graphical user interface displays a notification for the user to review an unapproved comment. The user provides inputs to the graphical user interface using the user device thereby providing the inputs necessary for the second determination module to perform its function e.g. determines whether the user has approved the comment. In some implementations the second user interface module can be a set of instructions executable by the second processor to provide the functionality described above for generating graphical data for providing user interfaces. In some instances the second user interface module can be stored in the second memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the second processor . The second user interface module may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the second processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

Referring now to an example of a method for suggesting a first user to authorize access rights to one or more second users is described. In the illustrated implementation the method can include identifying a first user based at least in part on activity data associated with the first user . For example the identification module parses activity data associated with a first user and determines the first user as a potential authorizer that has a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the first user . For example by parsing one or more browser cookies the identification module determines that the first user shares a computer with a second user and the first user may have a desire to authorize the second user to act e.g. comment on posts publish new posts etc. on behalf of the first user . The method can include determining one or more second users as authorization candidates for the first user . The method can also include generating suggestion data recommending the one or more second users as authorization candidates to the first user . For example the identification module determines one or more second users and generates suggestion data for recommending the first user to allow the one or more second users to act on behalf of the first user . The method can include providing a user interface displaying the suggestion data to the first user . For example the first user interface module generates graphical data and sends the graphical data to the user device causing the user device to provide a user interface displaying the suggestion data to the first user upon the first user logging in a service. The method can also include receiving an input from the first user specifying authorization settings. For example the first user clicks an authorize button on the user interface via the user device causing the first determination module to receive an input indicating that the first user has agreed to authorize the one or more second users an access right to act on behalf of the first user . The method can include updating account settings for the first user . For example the first determination module determines that the first user has agreed to authorize the one or more second users an access right to act on behalf of the first user and sends the determination to the update module that updates account settings for the first user based at least in part on the authorization specified by the first user .

Referring now to another example of a method for suggesting a first user to authorize access rights to one or more second users is described. Turning to the method can include retrieving activity data associated with a first user . For example the first controller retrieves activity data including session data and interaction data associated with a first user from one or more of the social network server the third party server and the user device . For example the session data can include one or more browser cookies. The interaction data can describe one or more user interactions associated with the first user . The method can also include determining that the first user may be a potential authorizer who has a potential for authorizing other users to act on behalf of the first user . For example the identification module parses one or more browser cookies associated with the first user and determines that the first user shares a computer with another user so that the first user may have a desire to authorize the other user an access right to act on behalf of the first user . The method can include determining one or more second users as proxies for the first user . For example the identification module determines one or more second users as proxies for the first user based on the activity data associated with the first user . For example the activity data indicates that the one or more second users may be users sharing computer devices with the first user . The method can include generating suggestion data recommending the one or more second users as proxies to the first user . For example the identification module generates suggestion data describing the one or more second users to be recommended to the first user to give authorization to. The method can also include storing the suggestion data in the storage . The method can include generating graphical data for displaying one or more suggestions to the first user and providing the graphical data to the first user . For example the first user interface module generates graphical data and sends the graphical data to the user device causing the user device to provide a user interface displaying the suggestion data to the first user upon the first user logging in a service.

Referring now to the method can include receiving a user indication responding to the one or more suggestions. For example the first user responds to the one or more suggestions in the user interface via the user device causing the first determination module to receive via the first controller a user indication describing the response of the first user . The method can also include determining whether the first user has agreed with the one or more suggestions based at least in part on the user indication. If the first determination module determines that the first user has not agreed with the one or more suggestions the method may continue by not updating account settings for the first user . Otherwise the method may continue by receiving a user input specifying the authorization settings for the first user . For example the first user further specifies authorization settings e.g. allowing the one or more second users to comment on existing posts but not to publish new posts on behalf of the first user etc. via a user interface causing the update module to receive via the first controller a user input specifying the authorization settings for the first user . The method can also including updating the first user s account settings. For example the update module configures the account settings for the first user based at least in part on the authorization settings specified by the user input.

Referring now to an example of a method for authorizing a first user to comment on behalf of a second user is described. Turning to the method can include receiving login information of a first user . For example a first user logs in a social network service provided by the social network application causing the social network application receiving login information for the first user . The method can also include receiving an authorization request for the first user commenting on a post as a second user . For example the first user selects an option of commenting on a post as a second user via a user interface causing the authentication module receives via the second controller an authorization request for the first user commenting on a post as the second user . The method can include determining whether the post has been shared with the second user as well. If the post has been shared with the second user the method may continue by determining whether the second user has an access right to comment on the post. Otherwise the method may continue by generating and sending a decline signal to one or more of the social network server and the user device .

If it can be determined that the second user has an access right to comment on the post the method may continue by retrieving account data describing account settings for the second user . If it can be determined that the second user does not have an access right to comment on the post the method may continue by generating and sending a decline signal to one or more of the social network server and the user device . The method also includes determining whether the account settings allow the first user an access right to comment on the second user s behalf. If the account settings for the second user do not allow the first user to comment on the second user s behalf the method may continue by generating and sending a decline signal to one of the social network server and the user device .

Referring to if the account settings for the second user allow the first user to comment on the second user s behalf the method may continue by sending an authorization signal to one or more of the social network server and the user device for allowing the first user to comment on the post on behalf of the second user . The method can include receiving a submission signal from one or more of the social network server and the user device indicating that the first user has submitted the comment. The method can also include generating a first notification for the second user including the comment and sending the first notification to one or more of the social network server and the user device for displaying the first notification to the second user upon the second user logging in a social network service. The method may also include receiving an edit on the comment by the first user . For example the first user edits on the comment via the user interface causing the notification module receives via the second controller the edit on the comment by the first user . The method may continue by generating a second notification including the edited comment and sending the second notification to one or more of the social network server and the user device . In some implementations receiving an edit on the comment by the first user generating a new notification and sending the new notification may not be included in the method if the first user does not edit on the submitted comment. In some implementations receiving an edit on the comment by the first user generating a new notification and sending the new notification may be repeated for multiple times depending upon the first user editing the comment for multiple times.

Referring to the method can include receiving an input describing a decision of the second user . For example the input specifies whether the second user has approved the comment or not. The method can also include determining whether the second user has approved the comment based at least in part on the input received at step . If the second user has not approved the comment the method may continue by not posting the comment. Otherwise the method may continue by determining metadata for the comment. For example the metadata for the comment includes data describing the author of the comment e.g. the first user the user on whose behalf the comment has been published e.g. the second user etc. The method may continue by posting the comment. For example the second user interface module generates graphical data and sends the graphical data to the user device causing the user device to include the comment in the second user s social feed displayed in a user interface. The method can also include storing the comment and the metadata associated with the comment in the storage .

In the above description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the specification. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In some instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the description. For example the present implementations can be described above primarily with reference to user interfaces and particular hardware. However the present implementations can apply to any type of computing device that can receive data and commands and any peripheral devices providing services.

Reference in the specification to some implementations or some instances means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the implementations or instances can be included in at least one implementation of the description. The appearances of the phrase in some implementations in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same implementations.

Some portions of the detailed descriptions that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms including processing or computing or calculating or determining or displaying or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

The present implementations of the specification can also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may include a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium including but is not limited to any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs and magnetic disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards flash memories including USB keys with non volatile memory or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions each coupled to a computer system bus.

The specification can take the form of some entirely hardware implementations some entirely software implementations or some implementations containing both hardware and software elements. In some preferred implementations the specification is implemented in software which includes but is not limited to firmware resident software microcode etc.

Furthermore the description can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer usable or computer readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description a computer usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain store communicate propagate or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device.

A data processing system suitable for storing and or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code bulk storage and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input output or I O devices including but not limited to keyboards displays pointing devices etc. can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I O controllers.

Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems cable modem and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.

Finally the algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition the specification is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the specification as described herein.

The foregoing description of the implementations of the specification has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the specification to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the disclosure be limited not by this detailed description but rather by the claims of this application. As will be understood by those familiar with the art the specification may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. Likewise the particular naming and division of the modules routines features attributes methodologies and other aspects are not mandatory or significant and the mechanisms that implement the specification or its features may have different names divisions and or formats. Furthermore as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art the modules routines features attributes methodologies and other aspects of the disclosure can be implemented as software hardware firmware or any combination of the three. Also wherever a component an example of which is a module of the specification is implemented as software the component can be implemented as a standalone program as part of a larger program as a plurality of separate programs as a statically or dynamically linked library as a kernel loadable module as a device driver and or in every and any other way known now or in the future to those of ordinary skill in the art of computer programming. Additionally the disclosure is in no way limited to implementation in any specific programming language or for any specific operating system or environment. Accordingly the disclosure is intended to be illustrative but not limiting of the scope of the specification which is set forth in the following claims.
