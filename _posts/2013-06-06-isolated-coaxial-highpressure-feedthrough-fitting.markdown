title: Isolated coaxial high-pressure feed-through fitting
abstract: An isolated, coaxial, high pressure feed-through fitting provides two electrical paths through a barrier. The fitting includes an outer dielectric disposed in an opening in the barrier. A conductive housing with a central through bore is disposed in the outer dielectric. An inner dielectric is disposed in the through bore in the conductive housing. A central conductor is disposed in the inner dielectric. One electrical path includes the central conductor and another electrical path includes the conductive housing. Flanged portions on the conductive housing and the central conductor bear on flanged portions of the outer dielectric and the inner dielectric, respectively, to create a high pressure seal.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to high pressure sealed electrical conduits and in particular to high pressure sealed electrical conduits used in munitions.

An ammunition data link ADL enables a fire control system to directly communicate with electronic devices disposed in a munition that has been loaded into a gun tube for firing. Examples of munitions that use an ADL include 120 mm tank rounds. The ADL must deliver data to the munition and must also seal the case of the munition against ultra high pressure combustion gases.

Existing ADLs on 120 mm munitions require two coaxial conduits or feed through devices. A known feed through fitting is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7 878 120 issued on Feb. 1 2011. Because the known fitting has only one electrical path two fittings are required. The use of two feed throughs per munition requires more machining of the munition case increased chances of failure and twice the amount of fittings and cables compared to a single feed through fitting. The known design uses two high pressure coaxial feed throughs that are screwed into two machined holes in the base of the munition case. One end of the feed through includes a spring loaded conductive plunger that contacts the rearward section of an ADL card thereby providing a contact element for the breech. The other end of the feed through includes a GPO SMP SubMiniature Push on type of cable connector for routing cable to the interior of the munition.

A need exists for a less expensive simpler and robust feed through design for routing electrical signals through the case of a munition.

One aspect of the invention is an isolated coaxial high pressure feed through fitting. The fitting includes an outer dielectric and a conductive housing. The outer dielectric has a hollow cylindrical portion and a flanged portion. The conductive housing has a central through bore and a flanged portion. The conductive housing is concentrically disposed in the hollow cylindrical portion of the outer dielectric. An outer surface of the conductive housing abuts an inner surface of the outer dielectric. The flanged portion of the conductive housing abuts the flanged portion of the outer dielectric.

The fitting includes an inner dielectric having a hollow cylindrical portion and a flanged portion. The inner dielectric is concentrically disposed in the central through bore of the conductive housing. An outer surface of the inner dielectric hollow cylindrical portion abuts a surface of the conductive housing that defines the central through bore. The inner dielectric flanged portion abuts a shoulder of the central through bore.

A central conductor is concentrically disposed in the central through bore. A first end of the central conductor includes a flanged portion and an inner connection pin. The central conductor flanged portion abuts the inner dielectric flanged portion. The inner connection pin is configured to mate with a coaxial cable connector.

The fitting may include a female contact receptacle concentrically disposed in the central through bore of the conductive housing. A second end of the central conductor may be translatably disposed in the female contact receptacle. A contact spring may be disposed between a second inner surface of the outer dielectric and a second outer surface of the conductive housing. The contact spring may form a press fit with the second outer surface of the conductive housing. The female contact receptacle may include a flexure that bears on the second end of the central conductor. The outer surface of the conductive housing may include a shoulder and one end of the contact spring may abut the shoulder.

The outer surface of the conductive housing and the inner surface of the outer dielectric may form a press fit. The outer surface of the conductive housing may include a retention detent. The central conductor may form a press fit with the hollow cylindrical portion of the inner dielectric. The outer surface of the inner dielectric hollow cylindrical portion may form a press fit with the surface of the conductive housing that defines the central through bore.

Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus having a case base. The case base includes distal and proximal surfaces. An opening extends between the distal and proximal surfaces and the opening has a central longitudinal axis. An ammunition data link ADL board is disposed in a groove in the distal surface of the case base. The ADL board has proximal and distal surfaces. The ADL board distal surface includes a distal outer contact ring a distal inner contact ring and a distal dielectric ring between the distal inner and distal outer contact rings. The ADL board proximal surface includes a proximal outer contact ring a proximal inner contact ring and a proximal dielectric ring between the proximal inner and proximal outer contact rings.

A via in the ADL board connects the distal outer contact ring and the proximal inner contact ring. Another via in the ADL board connects the distal inner contact ring and the proximal outer contact ring. A novel isolated coaxial high pressure feed through fitting is disposed in the opening in the case base.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A coaxial feed through fitting includes two conductive elements that enable electrical communication through a barrier subject to high pressure. The barrier may be a munition casing in which case the feed through fitting enables communication from inside the munition to a device that is external to the munition. The coaxial feed through fitting withstands and seals the ultra high pressure created in the munition during a ballistic event. The electrical communication may or may not be intact during or after the ballistic event. The munition is loaded into a gun tube for example from the breech of the gun tube. When the breech is closed twin ADL conductive rings on the base of the munition case make contact with breech contacts to provide electrical conductivity from the breech to the munition. The one piece twin conductor coaxial feed through fitting provides a pathway for electrical signals from the ADL conductive ring to the munition s electrical cable.
