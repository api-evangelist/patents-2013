This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 026157 filed on Feb. 9 2012 in the Japan Patent Office the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present invention relates to an image display apparatus that projects and displays an image on a screen.

Image display apparatuses such as projectors can project images on a projection screen for displaying the images. Such image display apparatuses have one or more connection terminals e.g. VGA terminal to which one or more information processing apparatuses such as personal computers PCs can be connected using cables. The connected information processing apparatuses transmit image data displayed on a display of the information processing apparatuses to the image display apparatus and the image display apparatus projects such image data transmitted from the information processing apparatuses on the screen.

Such image display apparatus needs to conduct a given process when changing a projection image from one screen image of a first information processing apparatus currently connected to the image display apparatus to another screen image of a second information processing apparatus. For example when projecting another screen image of the second information processing apparatus the first information processing apparatus may be required to be disconnected at first and then the second information processing apparatus is connected which is not a convenient process for a user.

In view of such issues JP 2009 180943 A discloses an image display apparatus such as a projector equipped with a plurality of input terminals connectable with a plurality of personal computers PCs in which the projector can display a screen image of each PC on a projection screen based on the image signals received via the input terminals. For example when image signals are input at only one input terminal the size of projection image of the input image signals is set to a full screen size and when image signals are input at the plurality of input terminals the size of each projection image corresponding to each of input image signals is set to a ratio based size based on the input image signals.

Such projector requires the input terminals corresponding to the numbers of PCs to display the screen image of each PC on the screen. Therefore as the numbers of screen images of PCs to be displayed on the screen increase the hardware size of connection circuit in the image display apparatus used for a plurality of PCs becomes large and complex.

With the development of wireless local area network LAN the image display apparatus can be equipped with a wireless communication function with which the image display apparatus can communicate data with a plurality of information processing apparatuses simultaneously.

With employing the wireless communication function the image display apparatus can communicate with a plurality of PCs simultaneously without using a plurality of input terminals by which a hardware size of the connection circuit in the image display apparatus used for the plurality of PCs may not become too large.

However each of the PCs cannot determine which PC corresponds to a target PC for the image display apparatus. Therefore each PC may need to transmit image signals of screen images to the image display apparatus constantly. Therefore as the numbers of connected PCs increase data size received by the image display apparatus becomes too great by which communication processing load of the image display apparatus increases.

JP 2006 92365 A discloses an image display apparatus to cope with such increased processing load. The image display apparatus connected to a plurality of terminal apparatuses receives a connection request from one of the terminal apparatuses and displays a screen image of the terminal apparatus that has issued the connection request. Among the plurality of terminal apparatuses a terminal apparatus that has issued the connection request at first can be set as a master terminal apparatus and each of other terminal apparatuses is set as a non master or slave terminal apparatus.

When the image display apparatus is under the operation based on a connection request from the non master terminal apparatus the master terminal apparatus can issue a connection request to the image display apparatus. Then the image display apparatus restricts the connection request from the non master terminal apparatus.

As such conventional image display apparatus restricts the connection request from the non master terminal apparatus once the image display apparatus is operated with the master terminal apparatus such as an information processing apparatus which is the apparatus connected to the image display apparatus at first. In such a configuration communications between the image display apparatus and the plurality of information processing apparatuses cannot be switched between active and non active status from the image display apparatus so easily.

In one aspect of the present invention an image display apparatus is devised. The image display apparatus includes a communication unit using a processing device to communicate with a plurality of information processing apparatuses an image synthesizing unit using the processing device to synthesize a multi segmented screen image data composed of screen images of the plurality of information processing apparatuses based on image data received from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses through the communication unit a projection unit to project the multi segmented screen image data synthesized by the image synthesizing unit onto a screen a functional mode management unit using the processing device to control switching between a normal projection mode and a multi segmented screen operation mode wherein the functional mode management unit receives an interrupt request from each of the information processing apparatuses when switched to the normal projection mode an image capture device to capture the multi segmented screen image displayed on the screen and an image of hand movement of an operator with respect to the multi segmented screen image when the functional mode management unit switches to the multi segmented screen operation mode a designated screen image recognition unit using the processing device to detect a hand movement of the operator with respect to the multi segmented screen image based on the multi segmented screen image and the image of hand movement of the operator captured by the image capture device and to recognize a screen image designated as an active target image in the multi segmented screen image based on the detected hand movement and a signal control unit using the processing device to transmit a request of image data transmission to an information processing apparatus corresponding to a screen image designated as an active target image by the designated screen image recognition unit and not to receive an interrupt request from an information processing apparatus corresponding to a screen image of a non active target image.

In another aspect of the present invention a method of managing image display for an image display apparatus is devised. The method includes the steps of communicating with a plurality of information processing apparatuses synthesizing a multi segmented screen image data composed of screen images of the plurality of information processing apparatuses based on image data received from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses through the communication unit projecting the multi segmented screen image data synthesized by the image synthesizing unit as a multi segmented screen image onto a screen controlling a switching between a normal projection mode and a multi segmented screen operation mode wherein an interrupt request from each of the information processing apparatuses is received by the image display apparatus when switched to the normal projection mode capturing the multi segmented screen image displayed on the screen and an image of hand movement of an operator with respect to the multi segmented screen image when the functional mode management unit switches to the multi segmented screen operation mode detecting a hand movement of the operator with respect to the multi segmented screen image based on the multi segmented screen image and the image of hand movement of the operator captured by the capturing and recognizing a screen image designated as an active target image in the multi segmented screen image based on the detected hand movement and transmitting a request of image data transmission to an information processing apparatus corresponding to the screen image designated as the active target image by the designated screen image recognition unit and not receiving an interrupt request from an information processing apparatus corresponding to a screen image of a non active target image.

In another aspect of the present invention a non transitory computer readable storage medium storing a program that when executed by a computer causes the computer to execute a method of managing image display for an image display apparatus is devised. The method includes the steps of communicating with a plurality of information processing apparatuses synthesizing a multi segmented screen image data composed of screen images of the plurality of information processing apparatuses based on image data received from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses through the communication unit projecting the multi segmented screen image data synthesized by the image synthesizing unit as a multi segmented screen image onto a screen controlling a switching between a normal projection mode and a multi segmented screen operation mode wherein an interrupt request from each of the information processing apparatuses is received by the image display apparatus when switched to the normal projection mode capturing the multi segmented screen image displayed on the screen and an image of hand movement of an operator with respect to the multi segmented screen image when the functional mode management unit switches to the multi segmented screen operation mode detecting a hand movement of the operator with respect to the multi segmented screen image based on the multi segmented screen image and the image of hand movement of the operator captured by the capturing and recognizing a screen image designated as an active target image in the multi segmented screen image based on the detected hand movement and transmitting a request of image data transmission to an information processing apparatus corresponding to the screen image designated as the active target image by the designated screen image recognition unit and not receiving an interrupt request from an information processing apparatus corresponding to a screen image of a non active target image.

A description is given of another example of an overall hardware configuration of the image display apparatus with reference to which shows an overall hardware configuration of an image display apparatus . The hardware configuration of the image display apparatus includes for example two functional units such as a main function unit and an additional function unit as shown in .

Further when the image display apparatus is switched to the normal projection mode the second power control unit instructs the first power control unit to stop power supply to the image input unit . As such the second power control unit and the first power control unit can be collectively used as a power supply stop unit.

A description is given of an internal hardware configuration of the image output unit with reference to which shows an internal hardware configuration of the image output unit shown in and . The image output unit includes for example an image processing unit a light modulator drive a light source controller a light source an optical lighting unit a light modulator and an optical focusing unit .

The image processing unit conducts imaging processes such as analog digital A D conversion interlace progressive I P conversion scaling process gamma correction and noise reduction to image signals input from the CPU or the second central processing unit and outputs he processed image signals to the light modulator drive wherein such input image signals are processed as image signals adapted to the light modulator . Further imaging processes such A D conversion I P conversion scaling process gamma correction process and noise reduction can be conducted by the image input unit shown in .

The light modulator drive outputs image signals processed by the image processing unit to the light modulator and drive the light modulator . The light modulator is configured with for example three liquid crystal displays LCDs corresponding to red R green G and blue B . The light emitted from the light source is separated by the optical lighting unit into three colors of R G B. Based on the image signals input from the light modulator drive the light modulator modulates each of separated light to imaging light corresponding to each color. The imaging light of each color such as R G B can be synthesized for example by using a dichroic prism and the synthesized imaging light is input to the optical focusing unit .

Based on light source control signal transmitted from the CPU or the second central processing unit the light source controller can change current to be supplied to the light source to control light intensity of the light source . The light source is for example a super high pressure mercury vapor lamp.

The optical lighting unit includes for example an integrator lens to set uniform light profile for the light emitted from the light source a polarization light conversion element to convert P wave component light wave component parallel to the incidence plane included in light emitted from the light source to S wave component light wave component perpendicular to the incidence plane for generating light having high luminance a dichroic mirror to separate light emitted from the light source into each color of R G B. Such units are known units and thereby the explanation is omitted.

The optical focusing unit is mainly configured with plurality of lenses including the projection lens . The plurality of lenses of the optical focusing unit have a light axis perpendicular to the screen and are arranged for example in a row along the light axis. Upon receiving the imaging light from the light modulator the optical focusing unit projects and focuses enlarged images on the screen .

A description is given of functional configuration of the CPU or the second central processing unit according to an example embodiment with reference to which shows a functional block diagram of the CPU or the second central processing unit . The CPU or the second central processing unit includes an extended function unit . The extended function unit includes for example a functional mode management unit a gesture recognition unit a gesture database a control signal generation unit a display image information management unit an image synthesizing unit a communication unit and a function setting unit .

Based on operation information input from the operation unit the functional mode management unit controls switching of two modes such as the normal projection mode and the multi segmented screen operation mode in the image display apparatus . The mode shifting between the normal projection mode and the multi segmented screen operation mode will be described later.

As such the functional mode management unit controls switching between the normal projection mode and the multi segmented screen operation mode and also controls a process of receiving an interrupt request from the PCs only when switched to the normal projection mode. As such the functional mode management unit can be used as a unit to manage functional mode.

Further when the normal projection mode is set the functional mode management unit transmits an instruction of power supply OFF of the image input unit to the power control unit or the second power control unit . Further when the multi segmented screen operation mode is set the functional mode management unit transmits an instruction of power supply ON of the image input unit to the power control unit or the second power control unit . With such a configuration because it is not required to capture the gesture of the user when the normal projection mode is set the power supply to the image input unit which is used for capturing the gesture of the user is stopped. With such a configuration power consumption by one or more units not using its function can be reduced in particular can be set zero by which the power consumption of the image display apparatus can be reduced.

Further when no operation is conducted for a given time period during the multi segmented screen operation mode the functional mode management unit automatically transmits an instruction of shifting to the energy save mode to the power control unit or the first power control unit and the second power control unit .

Further when a return instruction is issued the functional mode management unit transmits an instruction of returning to a mode which was used just before shifting to the energy save mode to the power control unit or the first power control unit and the second power control unit .

Further the above mentioned given time period used for determining a shift timing to the energy save mode can be retained in the image display apparatus as a time limit value and such time limit value can be changed by the user . With such configuration unnecessary power consumption during the standby mode can be reduced and such unnecessary power consumption can be reduced automatically using the time limit value set by the user

The gesture recognition unit can detect the hand movement of the user with respect to the multi segmented screen image based on the multi segmented screen image and image of hand movement of the user captured by the image input unit .

Further the gesture recognition unit can recognize a screen image designated as an active target image in the multi segmented screen image based on the above detected hand movement. Hereinafter an image of active target may be referred with the term of active status.

Further the gesture recognition unit can recognize a screen image designated as a specific operation target image in the multi segmented screen image and the types of hand movement of the user based on the above detected hand movement.

Further when the hand movement of the user is detected the gesture recognition unit may recognize a part of hand movement of the user . Further the gesture recognition unit outputs such recognition result to the control signal generation unit . As such the gesture recognition unit can be used as a designated screen image recognition unit.

The gesture recognition unit may conduct recognition process of gesture using for example a heat image taken by using infrared light invisible light image and a visible light image in which the heat image and the visible light image are compared to generate a difference based image to detect the hand movement. In this disclosure the difference based image means an image generated by comparing the heat image and the visible light image in view of difference of such images. The infrared image is used to detect body temperature of the user by which hand and face areas can be effectively recognized using the infrared image. The above mentioned visible light image is image data composed of the multi segmented screen image and the image of hand movement of the user captured by a digital camera disposed in the image input unit .

Further the above mentioned invisible light image such as heat image prepared from the infrared image can be obtained from the image output unit and then outputs to the gesture recognition unit . For example the projection lens of the image output unit includes a germanium lens to detect infrared and an infrared thermography is disposed for the image output unit . The light coming from the multi segmented screen image and the image of hand movement of the user passes the germanium lens of the projection lens and then is guided to the infrared thermography wherein the multi segmented screen image and the image of hand movement of the user are the same images captured by the image input unit .

The infrared thermography measures temperature difference at each portion of image based on the light coming from the multi segmented screen image and the image of hand movement of the user . Such temperature difference is indicated by different colors to generate heat image data and the heat image data is output to the gesture recognition unit . As such the heat image data may be infrared image data which can be obtained by computing energy amount of infrared radiated from an object which is a target object of capturing.

Based on the difference based image prepared by comparing the heat image data such as infrared image or invisible light image and image data of visible light image the gesture recognition unit can detect hands of the user . Because the hand of the user is an exposed skin similar to face or neck the hand of the user can be detected as a high temperature area compared to cloths.

Further because the infrared image can be captured without an effect of intensity of visible light. Therefore even if the visible light image cannot be taken with enough light intensity by generating the difference based image by comparing the infrared image and the visible light image an object such as hand position and contour of the user in an image can be correctly recognized. As such the recognition precision of gesture can be enhanced using a combination of visible light image and invisible light image. The difference based image is an image that can be obtained by computing the difference of the infrared image and the visible light image.

The gesture database stores a gesture operation table to which the gesture recognition unit refers information. The information of gesture operation table is a table format data that stores data prepared by correlating the types of hand movement of the user and specific operation contents for a screen image designated as specific operation target image. As such the gesture database can function as a storing unit. The information of gesture operation table can be stored for example in a memory such as the second storage unit . The gesture operation table will be described later.

Based on the recognition result received from the gesture recognition unit the control signal generation unit reads out a corresponding specific operation from the gesture operation table stored in the gesture database and converts the corresponding specific operation to a control signal. Such control signal is output to the display image information management unit .

Further the control signal generation unit outputs a control signal indicating a PC corresponding to a screen image designated as an active target image to the communication unit and outputs a control signal indicating a PC corresponding to a screen image not designated as an active target image to the communication unit .

Further even if a PC is requested to transmit image data of its PC the PC cannot transmit the image data due to some reasons. In such a case the communication unit receives a response from the PC that the PC cannot transmit the image data. Then the control signal generation unit may conduct followings for display of a screen image corresponding to such PC that cannot transmit the image data. In one case the control signal generation unit displays a screen image corresponding to such PC that cannot transmit the image data as non active target image in the multi segmented screen image and in another case the control signal generation unit stops displaying a screen image corresponding to such PC that cannot transmit the image data in the multi segmented screen image which becomes non display status. As such the control signal generation unit and the communication unit can be collectively used as an image display control unit.

The display image information management unit outputs image data corresponding to the screen image of each of the PCs input via the interface or the second interface to the image synthesizing unit .

Further upon receiving the control signals from the signal generation unit the display image information management unit stores and manages display screen image information. The display screen image information is a list of information including for example information indicating active target or non active target of each screen image in a multi segmented screen image to be projected on the screen information of position of screen image after conducting specific operations e.g. movement enlarging reducing to a screen image designated as specific operation target image in the multi segmented screen image. The display image information management unit outputs control signals to the image synthesizing unit based on the display screen image information.

The gesture recognition unit recognizes the types of hand movement of the user . The gesture database may include information of specific operation contents corresponding to the types of hand movement of the user recognized by the gesture recognition unit Based on specific operation contents stored in the gesture database to be conducted for a screen image designated as a specific operation target image the control signal generation unit and the display image information management unit can collectively function as a screen image processing control unit to conduct specific operation contents to a screen image designated as a specific operation target image.

Based on the image data corresponding to the screen image of each of the PCs received from the display image information management unit the image synthesizing unit generates image data of multi segmented screen image by synthesizing the image data corresponding to the screen images of the PCs and outputs such synthesized image data to the image output unit . As such based on the image data received from each one of the PCs via the interface or the second interface the image synthesizing unit synthesizes a multi segmented screen image data composed of the screen images of the PCs .

The image synthesizing unit synthesizes one screen image by overlaying a plurality of image layers. For example from the bottom layer to the upper layer a background layer a non active image layer and an active image layer are overlaid in this order and the most upper layer is the active image layer. Further if a plurality of screen images such as non active target image s and active target image s are overlaid a screen image that was operated most recently is set as a top image with respect to other screen image.

The communication unit controls data communication with the PCs . Upon receiving a control signal indicating that a PC having a screen image designated as active target image from the control signal generation unit the communication unit requests such PC to transmit image data and controls not to receive an interrupt request from a PC having a screen image not designated as active target image. Further when the communication unit receives a control signal indicating a PC having a screen image not designated as active target image the communication unit controls not to receive an interrupt request from such PC. As such the communication unit can be used as a unit to control data communication. Further the communication unit and the control signal generation unit can be collectively used as a signal control unit.

The function setting unit manages various settings. For example the function setting unit can set the upper limit numbers of displayable screen image that can be designated as active target image for the image display apparatus . The function setting unit can set each screen image of the PCs as a display image of non active target image or non display when the PCs transmits a not good NG response in return to an image data transmission request from the image display apparatus . The function setting unit can set detection conditions of gesture e.g. hand conditions . The user can change values of settings set by the function setting unit by operating the operation unit .

As such the function setting unit can be used as an upper limit setting unit to set the upper limit numbers of screen image displayable in the multi segmented screen image as active target image. The function setting unit can be used as a rewriting unit that can rewrite the types of hand movement of the user and specific operation contents for a screen image designated as specific operation target image stored in the gesture database . Further other functions such as known functions can be included in the extended function unit .

A description is given of a mode shifting of the image display apparatus with reference to . shows a mode shifting in the image display apparatus shown in and . The image display apparatus may be provided with two modes such as the normal projection mode and the multi segmented screen operation mode . In such mode shifting or switching the user may operate the operation unit for selecting the normal projection mode or the multi segmented screen operation mode and then the functional mode management unit controls the mode shifting or switching between the normal projection mode and the multi segmented screen operation mode .

In the normal projection mode the image display apparatuses hereinafter image display apparatus provides only a normal projection function. In the multi segmented screen operation mode the image display apparatus provides a function of projecting a multi segmented screen image according to an example embodiment.

When the power button is set ON the power supply starts for the image display apparatus and the image display apparatus is set to the normal projection mode . When a mode shifting or switching operation to the multi segmented screen operation mode is input during the normal projection mode step S of from the operation unit the functional mode management unit shifts or switches the image display apparatus to the multi segmented screen operation mode .

Further when a mode shifting or switching operation to the normal projection mode is input during the multi segmented screen operation mode step S of from the operation unit the functional mode management unit shifts or switches the image display apparatus to the normal projection mode . Further when no gesture is detected for a given time period during the multi segmented screen operation mode step S of the functional mode management unit shifts or switches the image display apparatus to the normal projection mode .

During the normal projection mode the image display apparatus can be accessed from any one of the PCs via a network such as wireless LAN. In contrast during the multi segmented screen operation mode the image display apparatus can be accessed from only a designated PC among the PCs such as a PC having a screen image designated by a gesture operation. Specifically when the image capture device of the image display apparatus captures a gesture operation that designates a screen image corresponding to one PC as an active PC e.g. PC image data can be transmitted to the image display apparatus only from the active PC e.g. PC and the image display apparatus does not receive an interrupt request from other PCs e.g. PC having non active image.

Further when the mode is shifted or switched the mode status i.e. normal projection mode multi segmented screen operation mode of the image display apparatus can be reported to the user . For example when the mode is shifted or switched between the normal projection mode and the multi segmented screen operation mode the functional mode management unit transmits an instruction of controlling lamp ON OFF of the lamp unit to the power control unit or the first power control unit .

For example the lamp unit can be set at lamp ON using yellow color light during the normal projection mode and the lamp unit can be set at lamp ON using red color light during the multi segmented screen operation mode . Further the lamp unit can be kept at lamp ON during the normal projection mode and the lamp unit can be set at lamp flashing during the multi segmented screen operation mode . With such configurations the user can easily recognize which mode i.e. normal projection mode multi segmented screen operation mode is set for the image display apparatus by which user friendly operation can be enhanced.

As above described when the user is making his presentation during the multi segmented screen operation mode even if the users to issue operation interrupt requests from the corresponding PC to such requests are not received by the image display apparatus . Therefore when the user is making his presentation an interrupt request from other users can be blocked during the presentation by which the user can make his presentation without concerns such as interruption by other PCs or users.

Further if the gesture recognition unit does not detect the hand movement of the user for a given time period during the multi segmented screen operation mode the functional mode management unit transmits an instruction of shifting to the energy save mode to the power control unit or the second power control unit to reduce power consumption of the image display apparatus . Based on such instruction for shifting to the energy save mode received from the functional mode management unit the power control unit or the second power control unit stops power supply to a given section such as a main section of the image display apparatus and shifts to the energy save mode.

Further when the mode is shifted or switched to the normal projection mode the functional mode management unit transmits an instruction of power supply stop to the image input unit to the power control unit or the second power control unit . Based on such instruction for power supply stop received from the functional mode management unit the power control unit or the second power control unit stops power supply to the image input unit of the image display apparatus . With such a configuration unnecessary power consumption of the image display apparatus can be reduced.

A description is given of projection of a multi segmented screen image. For example when the user starts a meeting by shifting the image display apparatus to the multi segmented screen operation mode the image display apparatus projects a multi segmented screen image generated by synthesizing each screen image of the PCs on the screen as a first process of the multi segmented screen operation mode .

A description is given of process of projection of a multi segmented screen image with reference to which shows a sequence of communication process between the image display apparatus and the PCs when the image display apparatus projects the multi segmented screen image generated by synthesizing each screen image of the PCs on the screen

As an initial condition to start such sequence process the image display apparatus is switched to the multi segmented screen operation mode. Further communication addresses are already set for the image display apparatus and the PCs used by the users to by which each of the PCs can communicate with the image display apparatus .

At step S of the PC transmits a display request to the image display apparatus with its own communication address. At step S the image display apparatus transmits OK response for the display request to the PC . At step S the PC transmits image data of screen image of the PC to the image display apparatus . At step S the image display apparatus projects only a screen image of the PC in a multi segmented screen image on the screen .

Further at step S the PC transmits a display request to the image display apparatus with its own communication address. At step S the image display apparatus transmits OK response for the display request to the PC . At step S the PC transmits image data of screen image of the PC to the image display apparatus . At step S the image display apparatus projects the screen image of the PC and the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image on the screen by adding the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image.

Further at step S the PC transmits a display request to the image display apparatus with its own communication address. At step S the image display apparatus transmits OK response for the display request to the PC . At step S the PC transmits image data of screen image of the PC to the image display apparatus . At step S the image display apparatus projects the screen images of the PC and PC and the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image on the screen by adding the screen of the PC in the multi segmented screen image.

Further at step S the PC transmits a display request to the image display apparatus with its own communication address. At step S the image display apparatus transmits OK response for the display request to the PC . At step S the PC transmits image data of screen image of the PC to the image display apparatus . At step S the image display apparatus projects the screen images of the PCs to and the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image on the screen by adding the screen of the PC in the multi segmented screen image. With such processing the image display apparatus projects the multi segmented screen image including each screen image of the PCs on the screen .

In such a configuration the user may operate the operation unit of the image display apparatus to switch or shift to the multi segmented screen operation mode by which the image display apparatus shifts to the multi segmented screen operation mode and then a meeting starts. If communication conditions are not so good during the above sequence of communication process and the screen image cannot be displayed the PCs may issue display requests again.

The communication protocol between the image display apparatus and the PCs can use any protocols such as simple object access protocol SOAP of web service and representational state transfer REST but not limited these.

Further the image display apparatus may not transmit no good NG response to the requests from the PCs most of the time but if the numbers of display requests exceeds the upper limit numbers of displayable screen image simultaneously in the multi segmented screen image the image display apparatus may transmit a no good NG response.

The upper limit numbers of screen image displayable in the multi segmented screen image can be restricted as follows. For example the user inputs the upper limit numbers of displayable screen image using the operation unit . Then based on the input upper limit numbers of displayable screen image the function setting unit sets the upper limit numbers of displayable screen image designate able as active target image in the multi segmented screen image and instructs the communication unit not to receive a display request when the numbers of display request exceeds the upper limit numbers of displayable screen image. Upon receiving such instruction the communication unit restricts a display request of screen image transmitted from an external apparatus. Further by setting a non display condition for one of currently displayed screen images a new screen image can be added and displayed in the multi segmented screen image.

With reference to a description is given of communication process between the image display apparatus and the PCs when the user operates a screen image in the multi segmented screen image using his gesture during a meeting. shows a sequence of communication process between the image display apparatus and the PCs when the user operates a screen image in the multi segmented screen image projected by the image display apparatus . As an initial condition to start such sequence process the image display apparatus is switched to the multi segmented screen operation mode.

Further communication is established between the image display apparatus and the PC to PC to communicate information but the image display apparatus does not receive interrupt requests from the PC to PC . Further the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image on the screen is at active status the screen image of the PC is non active status. Further the screen images of the PC and PC are non active status. At step S of because the PC is at the active status image data is continuously transmitted to the image display apparatus from the PC .

When the image display apparatus detects the hand movement of the user with respect to the multi segmented screen image on the screen at step S based on the detection result the image display apparatus recognizes the gesture that sets the screen image of the PC on the screen as active status.

At step S the image display apparatus transmits an active request to the PC . With such active request the image display apparatus requests the PC to transmit image data of current screen image of the PC to the image display apparatus . At step S the PC transmits image data of the screen image to the image display apparatus . Then the image display apparatus updates the screen image of the PC projected in the multi segmented screen image based on the image data of screen image transmitted from the PC .

If the PC issues a not good NG response to the active request the PC transmits the NG response to the image display apparatus . In this case the contents of the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image is not updated.

At step S because the PC is at the active status image data of screen image is continuously transmitted to the image display apparatus from the PC . As such when the image display apparatus receives OK response the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image on the screen is set at the active status and received image data of the latest screen image of the PC is projected. Further because the PC is still at the active status contents of the screen image of the PC can be updated continuously.

With such a configuration displayed contents of the screen images of the PCs and in the multi segmented screen image on the screen can be sequentially updated and thereby the user can proceed the presentation for a meeting based on contents of the screen images of the PCs and in the multi segmented screen image. Further because the image display apparatus can set the active status with only PC required to be communicated among a plurality of the PCs unnecessary increased communication data size between the image display apparatus and the PCs can be prevented by which the processing load of data communication in the image display apparatus can be reduced.

Further when the image display apparatus detects a new hand movement of the user with respect to the multi segmented screen image on the screen steps S and S are conducted. At step S based on the detection result the image display apparatus can recognize a gesture to move the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image on the screen and recognizes a movement direction and a movement amount of such movement.

At step S the image display apparatus moves the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image in line with the recognized movement direction with the movement amount and then synthesizes the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image and projects the multi segmented screen image. Although the screen image movement is described but various operations can be conducted for screen image in the multi segmented screen image. For example the size of screen image can be enlarged or reduced.

A description is given of a process by the image display apparatus when operating the screen image in the multi segmented screen image with reference to and .

As shown in the gesture operation table stores each type of gestures and corresponding specific operation contents. Further the display screen image information shown in includes the screen image position in the multi segmented screen image and flags indicating active or non active for each of terminal apparatuses such as PCs to connected to the image display apparatus . Further the display screen image information includes information indicating a layer of each screen image in the multi segmented screen image and Internet protocol IP address for each terminal apparatus.

When the image display apparatus is projecting the multi segmented screen image on the screen using the multi segmented screen operation mode at step S of the multi segmented screen image on the screen and an image of hand movement of an operator such as the user e.g. speaker may be captured and proceed to step S. The process at step S is conducted by the image input unit . Specifically the image capture device of the image input unit captures the multi segmented screen image on the screen and an image of hand movement of the user and outputs the captured image data to the gesture recognition unit .

At step S it is determined whether the hand movement of the operator is detected. If it is determined that the hand movement is detected step S YES proceed to step S and if it is determined that the hand movement is not detected step S NO return to step S. The process at step S is conducted by the gesture recognition unit . The gesture recognition unit detects the hand movement based on image data input from the image input unit . For example the gesture recognition unit detects the hand movement based on difference based image obtained from invisible light image such as infrared image and visible light image.

At step S it is determined whether a screen image is designated as an active target image. If it is determined that the screen image is designated as the active target image step S YES proceed to step S and if it is determined that the screen image is not designated as the active target image step S NO proceed to step S. The process at step S is conducted by the gesture recognition unit . Specifically the gesture recognition unit refers the gesture operation table stored in the gesture database to search specific operation contents corresponding the detected hand movement and recognizes whether the detected hand movement sets the screen image as the active target.

For example the gesture recognition unit detects a gesture from a movement of a hand of the user such as movement of right and or left hands. Further the gesture recognition unit can be configured to detect only a movement of a given portion of hand of the user . Further the gesture recognition unit can be configured to detect only a movement of one finger such as an index finger of the user used as a pointer for moving a screen image. Such detection can be conducted using known methods and thereby the explanation is omitted. With such a configuration detection of gestures not intended by a user can be prevented and user friendly operation can be enhanced.

Further the above detected hand movement may be a rotation of a finger for a target screen image. For example when a finger pointing a target screen is rotated in a clockwise direction while maintaining dragging of screen image such finger movement can be recognized as a movement that designates the screen image as active target image based on the specific operation contents corresponding to such finger movement shown in the gesture operation table of . As such at step S when a screen image designated as active target image in the multi segmented screen image displayed on the screen is recognized by the gesture recognition unit proceed to step S. The process at step S is conducted by the gesture recognition unit .

Upon recognizing the screen image set to the active status by the above detected hand movement the gesture recognition unit refers to display screen image information in the display image information management unit to recognize which screen image is designated by the above detected hand movement. For example by referring the display screen image information the gesture recognition unit searches the display screen image information to determine which screen image positions corresponds to positions of the above detected hand movement with respect to the screen .

For example if the position of the above detected hand movement corresponds to the screen image position of the PC X 0 Y 50 W 150 H 200 a flag of the PC in the active column is changed to ON to indicate active status and then it is recognized that the above detected hand movement designates the screen image of the PC and outputs the recognition result to the communication unit .

At step S a request of image data transmission is transmitted to a PC corresponding to the screen image designated as active target image in the multi segmented screen image displayed on the screen and it is controlled not to receive an interrupt request from a PC not corresponding to the screen image designated as active target image and then return to step S. With such processing only the screen images of the PCs and PC in the multi segmented screen image displayed on the screen can be set with activate status.

The process at step S is conducted by the communication unit based on the recognition result of the gesture recognition unit . Upon receiving the recognition result that the screen image of the PC is designated as the active target image from the gesture recognition unit the communication unit refers to display screen image information in the display image information management unit and obtains an IP address of the PC . For example IP address of yyy. yyy. yyy. yyy set for the PC is read out from the display screen image information . Based on the read IP address the communication unit requests the PC to transmit image data of screen image of the PC .

Further because a flag of the active column of the PCs and is set OFF in the display screen image information stored in the display image information management unit the communication unit controls not to receive an interrupt request from the PCs and corresponding to the screen images of non active target image.

When the extended function unit requests image data transmission to the PC and receives NG response from the PC that the PC cannot transmit image data the display screen image information in the display image information management unit can be written in which the display style of the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image can be changed to an image displayed under non active status or the screen image of the PC is not displayed non display status . As such when NG response is received from a PC corresponding to a screen image displayed in the multi segmented screen image a user can change the settings between the image display under non active status screen image of PC is displayed under non active status or non display screen image of PC is not displayed . Therefore an operation such as manual operation is not required to set the screen image of PC as non display by which user convenience or user friendliness can be enhanced.

Further the upper limit numbers of the screen image that can be set at the active status in the multi segmented screen image can be set. Specifically upon receiving the upper limit numbers of the screen image input by the user from the operation unit the function setting unit monitors the numbers of flag set ON i.e. active in the active column of display screen image information stored in the display image information management unit . Specifically if the gesture recognition unit sets the flag ON for PCs with a number exceeding the upper limit numbers of the screen image the function setting unit restricts the numbers of ON flag within the upper limit numbers of the screen image.

Further if the numbers of the screen image concurrently set as active status is to exceed the upper limit numbers of displayable screen image one of screen images currently active can be automatically set to a non active target image in which a screen image which becomes active status at first compared other screen images can be automatically set as the non active target image by which the numbers of the screen image simultaneously set as active status can be adjusted. With such a configuration communication data size between the image display apparatus and a plurality of the PCs can be adjusted by the user with his discretion.

Further in the above described processing the screen image of the PC may be set non active status when the screen image of the PC is set active status. In such a case because the screen image of the PC is at active status when the image display apparatus communicates with the PC image data of screen image of the PC is being transmitted to the image display apparatus . Then when the screen image of the PC is set non active status communication from the PC to the image display apparatus is stopped and it is switched to the communication only from the PC to the image display apparatus .

Then at step S of it is determined whether a screen image is designated as a specific operation target image. If it is determined that the screen image is designated as the specific operation target image S YES proceed to step S and if it is determined that the screen image is not designated as specific operation target image S NO return to step S. The process at step S is conducted by the gesture recognition unit . Specifically the gesture recognition unit recognizes the screen image designated as a specific operation target image in the multi segmented screen image and recognizes the types of hand movement of the user by referring the gesture operation table in the gesture database based on the above detected hand movement.

For example the above detected hand movement may be a movement of index finger into upward direction of a target screen image while the target screen image is pointed by the index finger one second or more with a dragging condition of screen image. In such a case by referring the gesture operation table such movement is recognized for moving the screen image in the upward direction based on specific operation contents corresponding to such movement.

At step S the designated specific operation contents is conducted for the screen image designated as the specific operation target image in the multi segmented screen image displayed on the screen and return to step S. The process at step S is conducted by the control signal generation unit and the display image information management unit .

The gesture recognition unit recognizes the types of hand movement of the user . The types of hand movement of the user can be corresponded to specific operation contents stored in the gesture database . Based on specific operation contents set for the designated screen image the control signal generation unit generates control signals for conducting the specific operation contents to the designated screen image and transmits the control signals to the display image information management unit .

Upon receiving the control signals from the control signal generation unit the display image information management unit rewrites the display screen image information and transmits the rewritten display screen image information to the image synthesizing unit . Further based on the rewritten display screen image information the image synthesizing unit updates display contents of the multi segmented screen image.

For example if an action to move the screen image of the PC in the multi segmented screen image into the upward direction is conducted the screen image of the PC is moved to an end position of the hand movement of the user in the multi segmented screen image

Further for example if the user changes his palm of hand from rock to paper for a target screen image the size of the screen image of the PC can be enlarged in the multi segmented screen image depending on the open size of hand and the enlargement of screen image of the PC can be continued until the hand movement stops.

Such up down left right movement including very small adjustment movement in up down left right and the size adjustment operation such as enlarging and reducing operation for the screen image in the multi segmented screen image which are different from operations to set an active status for a screen image can be conducted without information communication with the PC and image can be synthesized after such movement. Therefore the image display apparatus does not need information communication with the PC in such cases by which processing load of data communication can be reduced.

A description is given of a process of displaying images of specific operation contents corresponding to the types of hand movement of the user for the screen image in the multi segmented screen image with reference to .

In the above described processing images corresponding to the types of hand movement of the user recognized by the gesture recognition unit can be displayed e.g. projected on the screen . In such processing for example image data corresponding to each specific operation contents stored in the gesture operation table in the gesture database is stored in advance. For example the image data can be stored in the second storage unit .

Further the control signal generation unit transmits control signals including information of specific operation contents and image data corresponding to specific operation contents to the display image information management unit . Based on such control signals received from the control signal generation unit the display image information management unit transmits control signals of such image data corresponding the specific operation contents to the image synthesizing unit so that an image corresponding such image data is to be displayed on the screen image designated as an active target image in the multi segmented screen image. With such processing an image matched to the types of hand movement of the user recognized by the gesture recognition unit can be projected on the screen using the image output unit .

Further the gesture operation table stored in the gesture database can be rewritten. For example when the user inputs a rewriting instruction of the gesture operation table from the operation unit the function setting unit rewrites the gesture operation table stored in the gesture database using a gesture operation table received from an external apparatus. For example such external apparatus may be the PC to PC .

Further the gesture operation table can be received from a server on a network. Further the gesture operation table can be received from an apparatus or storage externally connected to the image display apparatus . With such a configuration the types of gestures and specific operation contents stored in the gesture operation table can be changed freely by which various gestures of user can be set and user convenience or user friendliness can be enhanced.

In the above described example embodiment of the image display apparatus active status and non active status of communication between the image display apparatus and a plurality of PCs to can be switched from the image display apparatus freely by which unnecessary communication between the image display apparatus and the plurality of PCs to can be reduced by which data communication size between the image display apparatus and the plurality of PCs to can be reduced. Further the above described example embodiment can be applied to any types of image display apparatus which can project or display images such as projectors but not limited these.

In the above described example embodiment the status of communication between an image display apparatus and a plurality of information processing apparatuses can be switched between active and non active from the image display apparatus freely.
