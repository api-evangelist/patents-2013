title: Controlled corrosion release system
abstract: A controlled corrosion release system for a payload is provided. The payload is submerged in a conductive medium, such as seawater. The system includes clips which restrain the payload against a housing. A circuit is established to allow electrical current to flow from a power source contained within the housing, through the clips which serve as anodes, through the seawater, into the housing which serves as a cathode, and back to the power source. Accordingly, the clips corrode and weaken structurally. The clips eventually fail and the payload is released. The time for release is proportional to the power supplied, such that the release time can be controlled.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.

The present invention relates to release systems. More particularly the present invention relates to controlled corrosion release systems for underwater payloads.

A number of applications require the placement of a payload in an underwater environment. Typically the payload is buoyant and is attached to an anchor that holds the payload underwater. After a period of time the payload is released from the anchor and rises to the surface. The well known options for securing and subsequently releasing the payloads from the anchor in these applications include constant corrosion releases mechanical releases utilizing a motor actuator or burn wire releases.

A constant corrosion release starts corroding the moment it is emplaced. Therefore with this method the actual moment of release cannot be changed. Also the mechanical strength of the restraining member that forms the release will necessarily decrease as this restraining member must also be the corroding member. Additionally the corrosion release cannot be guaranteed to release when desired.

A mechanical release requires more volume for an actuator and more complexity and cost. This type of release will have a lower reliability and does not have an efficient or practical fail safe release feature should the mechanical release fail to operate. A burn wire release burns through a tensioned wire releasing the pay load item. This method requires a more complex mechanism overall and has limited holding strength. As in the case of a mechanical release a burn wire release does not have a fail safe release feature. If the mechanism for initiating the burn wire fails the payload will not be released.

Thus a need has been recognized in the state of the art to provide a release mechanism that reduces both complexity and costs while increasing reliability. There is also a need to provide a release mechanism that includes a fail safe feature i.e. the release mechanism should eventually release the payload regardless if the primary release mechanism fails.

As in the case of a mechanical or burn wire release the payloads need to be released within a predetermined time after the release command is issued. Additionally there is a need to provide a release mechanism that requires a small amount of volume to implement while being able to vary the holding strength of the mechanism.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a controlled corrosion release system for a payload submerged in a conductive medium such as seawater. The system includes one or more clips which restrain the payload against a housing. A majority of the clips are anodes and the housing serves as a cathode. A power source is contained within the housing and is wired to the anodes and cathode.

When a release command is given electrical current passes from the power source through the anodes into the medium and to the cathode. The anodes are oxidized in the solution with the ions formed in the process being deposited on the cathode. Accordingly the anodes erode and dissolve and weaken structurally. The anodes eventually fail and the payload is released. Typically the payload is positively or negatively buoyant and the buoyant force of the payload accelerates the failure of the anodes as they weaken. The time for release is proportional to the power supplied such that the release time can be controlled.

The system provides a simple and reliable means for releasing a payload. There are no complex mechanical linkages that are subject to corrosion and failure. Additionally the system provides a fail safe mechanism in that the anodes corrode over time even when no current is applied between the anodes and the cathode.

In one embodiment a payload release system includes a housing one or more clips attached to the housing and a retaining ring secured to the clips. The payload is secured to the retaining ring and the housing maintains the payload submerged in a medium.

The system also includes a power source contained within the housing. A positive terminal of the power source is connected to a majority of the clips and a negative terminal of the power source is connected to the housing. The power source the connected clips the medium and the housing form a circuit. A controller is disposed within the circuit wherein corrosion of the connected clips is proportional to a current modulated by the controller and flowing in the circuit.

In one embodiment the clips connected to the power source are in the absence of the medium electrically isolated from the housing. Corrosion of the connected clips is confined to an end portion of each of the clips that abut the retaining ring. The end portion overlaps the retaining ring so as to resist the buoyancy of the payload. The end portion can have a sloped face which abuts a complementary sloped face of the retaining ring.

In one embodiment the housing can include a body portion to which the clips are attached. The housing also includes a lid. The power source is contained within a cavity formed between the body portion and the lid. The lid is sealed against the body portion and sealed against intrusion of the medium into the cavity.

In one embodiment each of the connected clips includes a connection element attached to the clip and penetrating through the body portion into the cavity to connect to the positive terminal. An insulating layer can be secured between each connected clip and the body portion.

In one embodiment a controlled corrosion payload release system includes a housing having a negative buoyancy and one or more clips attached to the housing. The payload is secured to the clips and the housing maintains the payload submerged in a medium. A power source is contained within the housing.

A positive terminal of the power source is connected to a majority of the clips and a negative terminal of the power source is connected to the housing. In the absence of the medium the clips connected to the power source are electrically isolated from the housing. The system also includes a controller wherein corrosion of the connected clips is proportional to a current modulated by the controller. The current flows from the positive terminal to the connected clips through the medium to the housing and returns to the negative terminal.

In one embodiment the housing includes a body portion with the clips being attached to the body portion. The housing also includes a lid. The power source is contained within a cavity formed between the body portion and the lid. The lid is sealed against the body portion and sealed against intrusion of the medium into the cavity.

In one embodiment each of the connected clips includes a connection element attached to the clip. The connection element penetrates through the body portion into the cavity to connect to the positive terminal. The clips include an end portion having a sloped face that overlaps a complementary sloped face of the payload so as to resist the buoyant force of the payload. The corrosion of the connected clips can be confined to their respective end portions.

In one embodiment the system includes an insulating layer secured between each of the connected clips and the body portion. The system can also include a first seal about the connection element and disposed between each connected clip and the insulating layer and a second seal about the connection element and disposed between the insulating layer and the body portion. The first and second seals prevent intrusion of the medium about the connection elements and into the cavity.

Referring now to there is shown a schematic side view of controlled corrosion release system deployed within conductive medium such as seawater. In the illustrated embodiment payload is buoyant and housing is negatively buoyant and capable of holding payload submerged in medium . Thus when payload is released it will rise to the surface of the sea for easy recovery. However it should be understood that payload need not be buoyant and housing need not be negatively buoyant to remain within the scope of the present invention. For example payload and or housing may be positively negatively or neutrally buoyant without departing from the scope of the invention as discussed later hereinbelow.

In the preferred embodiment illustrated in buoyant payload shown dashed in is attached to retaining ring . As will be described in further detail hereinafter retaining ring is secured against housing . Housing is weighted such that system together with payload is negatively buoyant and rests on bottom of medium .

Referring now to there is shown a schematic top view of controlled corrosion release system . Retaining ring is secured against housing by clips . Referring also to there is shown a partial cross sectional view of system taken at line of . For clarity of illustration but not limitation payload is not shown in . In and clips are illustrated as being recessed into cutouts of housing .

Power module is fixed within body of housing . Lid of housing attaches to body and with o ring forms a watertight seal against body . Conductive rod is attached to clip and penetrates through body into cavity formed between body and lid . Wiring connects clip to positive terminal of power module via conductive rod .

Current flows from module through wiring into rod and to clip . Current flows from clip through medium surrounding system to body and returns to negative terminal of module via connection . Thus clip serves as an anode and body serves as a cathode in the circuit. Accordingly and in the manner known in the art clip is oxidized and corrodes in conductive medium when current flows as described hereinbefore. When clip is sufficiently corroded retaining ring is released. In an exemplary embodiment the anode i.e. clip is comprised of aluminum and the cathode i.e. body is comprised of stainless steel.

In order for current to flow through medium from anode clip and then to cathode body clip must be electrically isolated from direct contact with body . Accordingly first insulating material is placed between clip and body . O rings prevent intrusion of medium into cavity adjacent rod .

Additionally second insulating material surrounds fasteners which attach clip to body . Further third insulating material surrounds rod as it penetrates through body . To prevent unintended corrosion of retaining ring face of retaining ring which abuts clip is formed of an insulating material.

Referring to there is shown a schematic wiring diagram of circuit formed by module wiring rod clip medium body and connection . In addition to power source module includes controller in communication with an operator not shown . When the operator provides a release signal to controller controller initiates the current flow described hereinbefore in the direction illustrated by arrows C in .

As is known to those of skill in the art the time for release depends on a number of factors including but not limited to the power supplied the surface area of clip exposed to medium the quantity of material that needs to be corroded to effect the release and the buoyancy of payload . These factors can be controlled such that the time for release can be determined for a specific design.

Referring now to there is shown a detailed view of retaining ring and end portion of clip taken at area A of . For clarity of illustration cross hatching is omitted from . Face of retaining ring is sloped such that top edge has a greater interior radius than lower edge . End portion of clip has a slope complementary to that of face such that retaining ring closely abuts clip .

The power required to corrode clip depends on the surface area of clip exposed to medium . To reduce the power required to release retaining ring corrosion of clip can be concentrated at end portion . To that end non conductive coating is applied to clip except at end portion

When the release signal is given current flows and end portion begins to corrode. As end portion corrodes the strength of end portion holding payload against a separation force or buoyant force F of payload is diminished. After the determined or designed release time period the strength is no longer adequate to resist force F and retaining ring and payload are released.

Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example illustrates three clips holding retaining ring . The number of clips can be varied to accommodate the design of payload and as few as one clip could be used where appropriate. Note that the power required to corrode anode clips increases with an increasing number of clips .

To lessen the power requirements for the configuration of not all clips need to function as anodes. For example in the illustrated example using three clips only two of the three clips need to corrode to effectively release payload . Buoyant force F can provide sufficient lifting force such that face of retaining ring can slide up end portion of non corroding clip . Various means can be taken to ensure that one such clip is non corroding including but not limited to not providing power to non corroding clip or fully covering non corroding clip with non conductive coating

Additionally face of retaining ring is described with respect to as being formed of insulating material. Those of skill in the art will recognize that retaining ring itself can be formed of an insulating material without the need for having its face formed of a separate insulating material. Similarly fasteners may also be formed of an insulating material without the need for separate second insulating material . Further insulating coatings can be used on rod and fasteners in lieu of third insulating material and second insulating material respectively.

In a further alternate configuration clips need not be recessed in cutouts . Also clips can be fabricated with slotted bores therethrough for fasteners . With this configuration clips can be radially adjusted to firmly abut against face of retaining ring . Still further controller can be in communication with payload to receive the release command. Additionally the shape of housing can vary from the round or frustoconical shape illustrated in .

In another embodiment payload and retaining ring can be separated from housing by a separation force other than buoyant force F. For example payload can be negatively buoyant and housing can be positively buoyant to maintain payload at the surface of the sea as illustrated in . Thus when clips corrode and no longer have the strength to resist the force W caused by the negative buoyancy of payload payload and retaining ring are released and allowed to sink to the seafloor.

It will be understood that many additional changes in details materials steps and arrangements of parts which have been described herein and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
