This application relates generally to the field of computer technology and in a specific example embodiment a system and method for monitoring a threat with a web based collaborative gateway.

Systems for monitoring and or controlling security devices have become increasingly popular in recent years. Such systems are used to communicate with security devices such as lights thermostats or security systems. Some conventional systems for controlling and monitoring security devices allow a user to access a server from a remote location using a device such as a desktop computer. For example a user can use a desktop computer located in a remote location to connect with the server. The user can then send commands to the server to control various security devices. For example the user can turn lights on or off. In another example the user accesses a video feed stored at the server that receives a video stream from a camera at a monitored location.

Such conventional systems for controlling and or monitoring security devices have at least the following disadvantages and limitations. The connection between the user s remote computer and the server may not be secured. A user could establish a secure connection but the cost and complexity involved in establishing such a connection are high. Such systems are also complex for users to implement and maintain. For example the server may be difficult to install and configure. Programming such systems can also be cumbersome and require custom configurations when adding supplemental security devices or services. Last it is difficult for the user to access the server using different types of remote devices. For instance conventional systems only allow a user to access the offsite server using for example a secured desktop computer located in the user s workplace.

Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to specific example embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the disclosure. Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.

In various embodiments a method and a system for monitoring a threat at a location associated with a gateway are described. The system has a gateway a web server and a client device. The gateway detects identifies and tracks a threat at a location associated with the gateway. The gateway is coupled to a security device. The web server has a management application configured to communicate with the gateway. The client device communicates with the gateway identified by the web server. The gateway aggregates monitoring data from the security device and from other security devices respectively coupled to other gateways correlated with the gateway. The client device receives the aggregated monitoring data and controls the security device coupled to the respective gateway from a web based user interface at the client device.

For purposes of the present embodiment the terms sites and premises refer to any location to be monitored whether residential commercial public or secured. Further the term a is generally used in the present disclosure to mean one or more. Still further the terms coupled and operatively coupled mean connected in such a way that data may be exchanged. It is understood that coupled and operatively coupled do not require a direct connection a wired connection or even a permanent connection. It is sufficient for purposes of the present embodiment that the connection s be established for the sole purpose of exchanging information.

The client devices are connected to the computer network . The client devices can include but are not limited to a desktop computer a laptop computer a mobile computing device a mobile smart phone device and so forth. A network interface means is provided to enable the client devices to send and receive data to and from the computer network . The client device may include a web browser that may be in communication with the web server via the computer network . In another example the client device includes a programmatic client such as a client application configured to communicate with the web server via the computer network . The web browser or the client application may be used to display some or all of the information and monitoring data provided by gateways and .

The computer network can include a local area network LAN where Gigabit Ethernet switches are used to switch data. In another example the computer network includes a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. In general computer network may be a public network or private network and a single network or a combination of several networks. In most embodiments computer network may be but is not required to be an IP based network. In some embodiments it may be desirable for all or a portion of network to include publicly available networks such as the Internet to avoid the need for installing purchasing or leasing additional infrastructure.

The web server may also connect to the computer network both to receive and transmit data. The web server may also be referred to as a web based host. The web server is connected to the computer network by a means of a network interface. The network interface can take the form of a network interface card not shown installed within the web server to enable data to be sent and received to and from the computer network by the web server .

In one embodiment the web server identifies one or more gateway s for the client devices to communicate with so as to monitor and or control the security devices connected to the corresponding gateway s .

In another embodiment the web server may provide server side functionality via the computer network to the client devices . The client devices may enable users that utilize the network system and more specifically the web server to view monitoring data e.g. audio video feed from security devices connected to gateways and over the computer network . These transactions may include transmitting receiving communicating and processing data to from and regarding monitoring data and users of the network system . The data may include but are not limited to audio video picture metadata camera configuration data client device configuration data and network data monitoring data. The web server can provide other functions including storing monitoring data to an internal or external disk storage device not shown and playing back recorded monitoring data. In one embodiment the web server may perform analytics computation on the data from the gateways and .

In one embodiment the web server may include a directory of gateways and the location of security devices connected to each gateway e.g. camera a is located in room b at location c associated with gateway d gateway e is associated with building f etc. . The web server is described in more detail below with respect to . As such the web server may correlate the gateway at site A to the gateway at site B. In one embodiment the correlation may be generated pursuant to pre defined settings or configurations based on user profile organization topology hierarchy bandwidth and other factors. For example a user at client device may be a manager responsible for stores located on the West coast. If both sites A and B are on the West coast the web server correlates gateway to gateway . As such based on the user profile and the organization topology the user only needs to access gateway to obtain monitoring data from sites A and B. In other words the user does not have to communicate directly with several gateways to monitor all security devices attached to the corresponding gateways. In another embodiment the web server may correlate gateway with other gateways. In yet another embodiment the other gateways may be correlated with other gateways. For example information from other gateways correlated with the gateway which is correlated with gateway may be communicated with the user at the client device or .

Generally gateways and include a processor based device that operates to monitor conditions at a target site or premise analyze monitoring data detect alarm conditions at the target site or premise capture information relating to such alarm conditions and send such monitoring information to client devices and or the web server .

Gateways and are located at the same site A. In one embodiment gateways are capable of balancing their respective loads. Furthermore gateways may provide a redundant backup of each other. Gateways are connected to a local area network LAN . In another embodiment gateways communicate with one another via a peer to peer network.

Security devices e.g. monitoring devices and controlling devices and are connected to the gateways via LAN . Monitoring devices include for example sensors. The gateways are not limited to connecting to any specific type or model of sensors or monitoring devices. Any sensor may be used depending on the desired type and level of protection. Examples include without limitation microphones cameras magnetic contact switches audio sensors infrared sensors motion detectors fire alarms and carbon monoxide sensors. For illustration purposes location site A in includes a biometric device e.g. fingerprint reader and an access control device e.g. door gate access sensor .

In addition controlling devices may include devices that can be controlled such as a HVAC system e.g. heater air conditioning system including thermometer smoke sensor thermostat a gate door lock and a camera positioning system e.g. tilt pan .

The HVAC system the biometric device and the access control device are located at site A and are connected to the gateway via LAN .

The gateway is located at another location site B away from location site A e.g. different physical locations . An audio video device e.g. camera microphone and an RFID device e.g. card reader are directly connected to gateway . The gateway communicates with the computer network .

In another embodiment gateways and from site A communicate with the gateway from site B. As such client devices can monitor data from audio video device and RFID device connected to the gateway by communicating only with gateway . Similarly client devices can monitor data from the HVAC the biometric device and the access control device connected to gateway by communicating only with the gateway .

In another example the gateway may also include an access control API an access control application module and access control drivers . The access control API provides an interface to the web browser or the client application of the client devices to receive and send data from an access control device e.g. a door access at a monitored site connected to the gateway . The access control application module enables the client device to receive data e.g. time and ID log of the door access at the monitored site from the access control device via the access control API . In another embodiment the access control application module enables the client device to send commands e.g. open close lock door or data to the access control device via the access control API . The access control drivers include one or more drivers for different brands or manufacturers of access control devices.

One advantage of one of the embodiments of the gateway is the ability to easily connect additional devices or third party devices. This is illustrated with respect to other API other application modules and other drivers . As such the gateway is not limited to any particular manufacturer of devices or brand of devices. The gateway allows for easy expansion and plug in features using additional APIs corresponding modules and corresponding device drivers.

In one embodiment the communication module includes a user authentication module a user access policy module a web server authentication module and a transport module .

The user authentication module authenticates a user at the client device based on a user profile of the user. An example of user authentication may include verifying the username and password provided by the client device with a predefined user profile. The predefined user profile may be stored in the storage device or at the web server .

The user access policy module limits or grants the user at the client device access to the monitoring and or controlling devices connected to the gateway. For example a user with limited privilege may have access to the monitoring data to a particular site e.g. first floor only or a specific monitoring device e.g. HVAC only . On the other hand a user with executive privilege may be able to view monitoring data and control security devices from more sites.

The web server authentication module authenticates a communication between the gateway and the web server . For example the gateway transmits a unique token to the web server for authentication prior to establishing the secured communication. Those of ordinary skills in the art will recognize that other means of authentication between the gateway and the web server may be used.

The transport module enables peer to peer communication between gateways. As such a client device communicating with one gateway at a first location is also able to communicate with another gateway at a second location.

In one embodiment the remote devices management module of the web based monitoring application includes an analytics module an event aggregation module an event based control module and a client based control module .

The analytics module analyzes audio video and other detected changes from the monitoring devices and generates events based on the analysis. For example the analytics module is capable of determining how many people have entered or left an activity zone e.g. a room a hallway in a video feed the direction of the movement of individuals in a video feed the temperature of individuals in a video feed facial recognition of individuals in a video feed and so forth. Events are generated based on the analysis and predefined user configured settings. A user at the client device is able to configure the conditions for generating an event from the web browser of the client device or the client application of the client device .

The event aggregation module aggregates events generated from the analytics module . For example events generated based on the analysis and predefined user configured settings are aggregated in a log stored in a storage device attached to the gateway in a storage device attached to another gateway in a storage device attached to the web server or in a storage device connected to the client device.

The event based control module communicates a command to at least one controlling device connected to the corresponding gateway based on an event identified in event aggregation module based on an event configuration. For example an event comprises a temperature of a room reaching a predefined maximum temperature. The event based control module may communicate to the HVAC system to turn on the air conditioning system for the room if such an event occurs.

The client based control module communicates a command to one or more controlling devices of the corresponding gateway based on a command initiated and communicated from the client device. For example a user at the client device may initiate a command to pan a camera connected to the gateway. Such a command would be communicated to the camera via the client based control module .

The threat event module may be configured to detect identify and track a threat at a location associated with the gateway.

For example the threat detection module may detect a robbery in progress based on a trigger from an employee at a store associated with a gateway. The threat detection module may also detect a threat based on audio or video analytics such as detecting the sound signature of a gunshot. Once the threat detection module detects the threat the presence detection module may identify individuals or objects involved in the threat. For example the presence detection module may use facial recognition or audio analytics to identify known and unknown individuals and their respective locations e.g. which room or building . Known individuals may be registered individuals who are allowed in the location or building or have access to the location building. The threat tracking module may also track and follow the movement of the known and unknown individuals. In one embodiment the threat tracking module may consider unknown individuals as a source of threat.

The user triggered threat module detects a threat based on a user triggered alert notification received at the gateway. For example depressing an emergency switch connected to the gateway may trigger a notification of a threat at a location associated with the gateway.

The facial recognition module may identify an individual using a facial recognition algorithm applied onto an image provided by the security device at the gateway. For example the facial recognition module may recognize employees of a bank using a database of bank employee identifications.

The voice recognition module may identify an individual using a voice recognition algorithm applied to an audio provided by one of the security devices e.g. microphone at the gateway. For example the voice recognition module may recognize the voices of a school staff using a database of school staff voice samples.

The people count module may count the number of persons or individuals from the image s provided by the security devices at the gateway. For example the people count module may estimate and infer the number of people in a room based on video or pictures from different cameras disposed throughout the room. The people count module may rely on the facial recognition module to determine that the same person is being shown in pictures from different cameras.

The mapping module may determine or retrieve a schematic layout or map of the location associated with the gateway. For example the mapping module may retrieve a map of a building showing the different rooms. The mapping module may also identify where the different security devices associated with the gateway are disposed throughout the different rooms. For example the mapping module may show the location of a camera and the angle covered by the camera in a room. Furthermore access controls such as locks may also be identified in the map.

The identified individual tracking module may track a position of an identified individual in the layout. For example the identified individual tracking module may track the position and movement of a staff teacher in a school building or a bank teller in a bank. For example a representation of the room in which the identified individuals are located may be highlighted on a map e.g. flashing green to indicate the presence of identified individuals. In another embodiment a breadcrumb trail e.g. a series of indicators such as dots or dashes displayed on a map may show the past movements of the identified individuals.

The unidentified individual tracking module may track a position of an unidentified individual in the layout. In one example the threat tracking module may identify the unidentified individual as a potential threat at the location of the gateway. For example the unidentified individual tracking module may track the position and movement of the unidentified individual in a school in a bank or in any physical location associated with the gateway. Furthermore the unidentified individual tracking module may generate a visual emphasis in the layout of the position and movement of the unidentified individual. For example a representation of the room in which where the unidentified individual is located may be highlighted on a map e.g. flashing red to indicate the present location of the unidentified individual. In another embodiment a breadcrumb trail displayed on a map may show the past movements of the unidentified individual.

In another embodiment the unidentified individual tracking module may determine or predict future movements of the unidentified individual based on past movements. For example the unidentified individual tracking module may compute a combination of paths on the map that the unidentified individual may take e.g. different arrows on a map showing different possible paths of the unidentified individual in a building .

In yet another embodiment security devices connected to the gateway at the location of the unidentified individual may be controlled to thwart the threat of the unidentified individual. For example door locks in the predicted path of the unidentified individual may be controlled by the gateway to lock the doors in the path of the unidentified individual. In another example smoke generators disposed in the predicted path or at the location of the unidentified individual may be remotely activated with the gateway to further distract the unidentified individual.

In another embodiment the threat tracking module may identify a person with a weapon as a potential threat using analytics module .

In one embodiment the web based gateway management application includes a gateway directory manager a user authentication module and a gateway authentication module . The gateway directory manager identifies a gateway associated with a user profile. For example a user may only be able to access a particular gateway or a particular set of devices connected to a gateway. As such a west coast manager of an organization may be able to access monitored sites only from west coast stores of the organization. In contrast a user with higher privileges may be able to access more gateways and devices. As such the CEO of an organization with stores throughout the United States may be able to view monitoring data from all the stores in the United States. Law enforcement officials may be authenticated so that they can monitor in a live manner video and audio feeds from a building under threat. For example SWAT teams may monitor live the location of an unidentified individual who may be a potential threat using a client device communicating with the gateway.

In another embodiment the gateway directory manager includes a service manager module to enable add on services to the user at the client device. For example the add on services include but are not limited to remote storage remote audio two way audio dynamic backup or reporting based on the user profile.

The user authentication module authenticates the web server with the user at the client device based on the user profile. For example the web server verifies the username and password of the user at the client device.

The gateway authentication module authenticates the identified gateway. For example the web server receives a unique token from the identified gateway to authenticate the identified gateway prior to establishing secured communication between the web server and the gateway.

The storage device may be used to store user profiles tokens from gateways a directory of gateways with corresponding devices services from the gateways a directory of gateways associated with a user profile and a directory of connected security devices associated with a user profile.

In another embodiment the gateway is interfaced with the client device with an API. The corresponding monitoring or controlling device coupled to the gateway is monitored and controlled with an application module. Interaction of the application module with the corresponding monitoring or controlling device is enabled with a device driver.

In another embodiment communication with the web server and the client device is enabled with a communication module of the gateway. The client device is enabled to monitor or control the plurality of monitoring or controlling devices coupled to the gateway with a remote devices management module of the gateway.

In one embodiment enabling communication with the web server and the client device comprises authenticating a user at the client device based on a user profile of the user with a user authentication module. The user at the client device is limited or granted access to the monitoring and controlling devices according to the user s access policy. A communication between the gateway and the web server is authenticated with a web server authentication module. The peer to peer communication between gateways is enabled with a transport module.

In one embodiment enabling the client device to monitor or control the monitoring or controlling devices connected to the gateway comprises analyzing audio and video from the monitoring devices and to generating events based on the analysis with an analytics module. The events generated from the analytics module are aggregated with an event aggregation module. A command is communicated to at least one controlling device of the corresponding gateway based on an event identified in the aggregated events based on an event configuration with an event based control module. A command is communicated to at least one controlling device of the corresponding gateway based on a command communicated from the client device with a client based control module.

The machine includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU a digital signal processor DSP an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a radio frequency integrated circuit RFIC or any suitable combination thereof a main memory and a static memory which are configured to communicate with each other via a bus . The machine may further include a graphics display e.g. a plasma display panel PDP a light emitting diode LED display a liquid crystal display LCD a projector or a cathode ray tube CRT . The machine may also include an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse a touchpad a trackball a joystick a motion sensor or other pointing instrument a storage unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The storage unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored the instructions embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory within the processor e.g. within the processor s cache memory or both during execution thereof by the machine . Accordingly the main memory and the processor may be considered as machine readable media. The instructions may be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device .

As used herein the term memory refers to a machine readable medium able to store data temporarily or permanently and may be taken to include but not be limited to random access memory RAM read only memory ROM buffer memory flash memory and cache memory. While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database or associated caches and servers able to store instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium or combination of multiple media that is capable of storing instructions for execution by a machine e.g. machine such that the instructions when executed by one or more processors of the machine e.g. processor cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies described herein. Accordingly a machine readable medium refers to a single storage apparatus or device as well as cloud based storage systems or storage networks that include multiple storage apparatuses or devices. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to one or more data repositories in the form of a solid state memory an optical medium a magnetic medium or any suitable combination thereof.

Throughout this specification plural instances may implement components operations or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations modifications additions and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone computer system a client computer system or a server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In some embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically electronically or any suitable combination thereof. For example a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may be a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an ASIC. A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the phrase hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where a hardware module comprises a general purpose processor configured by software to become a special purpose processor the general purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special purpose processors e.g. comprising different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented with a processor being an example of hardware. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. Moreover the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. an API .

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of the subject matter discussed herein may be presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . Such algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or any suitable combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information. Furthermore unless specifically stated otherwise the terms a or an are herein used as is common in patent documents to include one or more than one instance. Finally as used herein the conjunction or refers to a non exclusive or unless specifically stated otherwise.
