title: Method and apparatus for managing access to electronic content
abstract: According to at least one example embodiment, a method and corresponding content protection server for managing access to electronic content comprise retrieving access policies, or permissions, associated with a content item from a corresponding content sharing application, or rights issuer. The access policies are translated into a format recognizable by a digital rights management (DRM) engine, and forwarded to the DRM engine. The translated access policies are then provided by the DRM engine to a client device where the translated access policies are enforced in managing any potential access to the content item.
