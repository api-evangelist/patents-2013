The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems IHSs and more particularly to systems and methods for configuring and managing a Data Center Bridging DCB IHS network.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system IHS . An IHS generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications IHSs may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in IHSs allow for IHSs to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition IHSs may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

Data Center Bridging DCB refers to a set of enhancements to Ethernet networks e.g. local area networks LANs for use in data center environments. For example for selected traffic in the network DCB attempts to eliminate loss due to queue overflow and to allocate bandwidth on links. The configuration and management of IHS networks that utilize DCB raises a number of issues.

For example in large scale multi hop networks such as cloud networking environments DCB becomes very complicated to configure and manage. Network administrators are forced to configure each Network Interface Controller NIC and switch port in the system and just a few of the details involved in configuring and managing a DCB network include configuring switch ports for DCB exchange DCBX recovering from failures notifications resulting from DCBX link level exchanges conventional DCB configuration is peer to peer using the Link Layer Discovery Protocol LLDP via TLV units and managing DCB parameters at each switch port in the DCB network as well as at the ports on endpoint devices connected to the DCB network. Furthermore making changes to DCB configuration following the initial configuration of a DCB network is very difficult as a network administrator must manually make such configuration changes on all of the ports that connect a first endpoint device to a second endpoint device. Such complications and difficulties result in many network administrators deciding not to deploy Remote Direct Memory Access RDMA over Converged Ethernet RoCE Fibre Channel over Ethernet FCoE Internet Small Computer System Interface iSCSI and or other network protocols with DCB enabled on their networks as despite the ability of DCB to provide lossless behavior and Quality of Service QoS capabilities the configuration management hurdles become too high and networks with dynamically adjusting requirements become too burdensome.

According to one embodiment an information handling system IHS network includes a plurality of switch IHSs that are connected together to provide an IHS network a management IHS coupled to each of the plurality of switch IHSs through a management network wherein the management IHS is configured to identify a plurality of data traffic flows and for each identified data traffic flow to determine a flow path through the IHS network wherein the flow path includes at least some of the plurality of switch IHSs and provide configuration information to each of the switch IHSs included in the flow path such that a quality of service QoS is provided for the data traffic flow along the flow path through the IHS network according to the configuration information.

For purposes of this disclosure an IHS may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute classify process transmit receive retrieve originate switch store display manifest detect record reproduce handle or utilize any form of information intelligence or data for business scientific control entertainment or other purposes.

For example the management IHS may provide a soft defined networking SDN controller or other embedded management controller that performs the functions discussed below. The management IHS may be coupled to a management network through for example a link between a management port on a management network interface controller NIC and the management network .

The IHS network also includes a plurality of coupled IHSs that includes a plurality of endpoint IHSs and and a plurality of switch IHSs and up to . While only three endpoint IHSs and four switch IHSs are illustrated for clarity of discussion and illustration one of skill in the art will recognize that a multi hop data center environment may include any number of endpoint IHSs and any number of switch IHSs. Furthermore while only switch IHSs are illustrated other packet handling IHSs may be included in the IHS network without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment the endpoint IHSs and or may include physical server IHSs virtual machines located on one or more server IHSs storage systems such as Internet Small Computer System Interface iSCSI storage arrays Fibre Channel over Ethernet FCoE storage arrays Network Attached Storage NAS platforms backup storage appliances and cloud storage gateways network devices such as routers load balancers firewalls and security devices and or a variety of other data center environments IHSs known in the art.

Furthermore the endpoint IHS is coupled to the switch IHS through a link or links between for example traffic ports located on add on NICs in each of the IHS and the switch IHS . Similarly the switch IHS is coupled to the switch IHS by a link or links the switch IHS is coupled to the switch IHS by a link or links the switch IHS is coupled to the switch IHS by a link or links and the switch IHS is coupled to the endpoint IHSs and by a link or links and respectively.

Referring now to a flow based networking device is illustrated that in the embodiments discussed below is a flow based networking switch IHS . In an embodiment the switch IHS may be the IHS described above with reference to and may include some or all of the components of the IHS . In an embodiment the switch IHS may include route processing managers line modules switch fabric and or in a variety of other network components known in the art. The switch IHS includes a plurality of ports that include management ports and Ethernet traffic ports . The ports are each coupled to an interface that may include for example a Media Interface with physical PHY and link MAC layers. The interface couples the ports to a packet processor which in an embodiment may be a flow based packet processing chip such as for example a chip that has been optimized to inspect and classify application layer packet information as opposed to convention packet processing chips that process packets based on layer 2 and layer 3 data . The packet processor includes a flow based handler and session manager and a flow based processing engine . Each of the flow based handler and session manager and the flow based processing engine are coupled to the interface . The flow based handler and session manager and the flow based processing engine are coupled to each other and to a memory . In some embodiments the memory may be external to the packet processor and coupled to at least one core of the packet processor through a high speed memory bus. The memory includes a plurality of queues e.g. hardware queues and a data traffic flow table . The data traffic flow table may include a plurality of flow match rules discussed in further detail below. While not illustrated in detail one of skill in the art will recognize that the switch IHS may include one or more non transitory computer readable mediums that are coupled to the packet processor and include instructions that when executed by the packet processor cause the packet processor to provide the functions of the flow based handler and session manager and the flow based processing engine .

The packet processor is configured to provide flow based networking functionality for the switch IHS by performing packet flow metadata search inspection collection and processing by retrieving metadata from packet flow headers pertaining to application flow match requirements e.g. signatures data types application policies forwarding modification rules and or a variety of other application flow match requirements known in the art. The flow based networking architecture illustrated in may be leveraged for access network designs aggregation network designs and a variety of other network designs known in the art. The flow based processing provided by the switch IHS addresses next generation network architecture that requires intensive and high performance packet processing of content aware applications and services at line rate speeds while providing programmable deep packet inspection and classification of complex data types of flow based services designed into emerging technologies e.g. the OpenFlow protocol L4 L7 protocols security and filtering traffic management load balancing rate shaping and or a variety of other emerging technologies known in the art. 

While not discussed in detail herein the flow based processing performed by the switch IHS includes for example any or all of assembling received packet data into packets performing a deep inspection on packet headers in the packets to retrieve metadata and comparing that metadata to flow match rules that are stored in the data traffic flow table to determine whether the packets match a data traffic flow that is associated with one or more of the flow match rules that are stored in the data traffic flow table . Data traffic flows may be tracked monitored and maintained and packets received may be matched to data traffic flows until a data traffic flow session stop indicator is received. As discussed below in the IHS network the flow based networking functionality of the switch IHSs is leveraged to provide seamless and dynamic DCB management in a large scale multi hop network.

Referring now to an embodiment of a method for providing a DCB IHS network is illustrated. As discussed further according to some of the embodiments detailed below Software Defined Networking SDN or flow based networking is leveraged to configured and manage DCB in the IHS network . For example an SDN controller in the management IHS is provided a full view through the management network of the topology of the IHS network e.g. the endpoint IHSs the switch IHSs and or other components in the network and may use a combination of the OpenFlow communication protocol and extension application programming interfaces APIs to configure and manage DCB on any endpoint IHS to endpoint IHS path through the IHS network . In many embodiments this may negate the need to provide support for DCB exchange DCBX and priority tagging of Ethernet frames in endpoint IHSs workloads and or operating systems. Instead data traffic flows may be mapped directly to the DCB priority hardware queues in the switch IHSs to allow the switch IHSs to enforce lossless Ethernet and quality of service QoS policies for those data traffic flows.

Prior to the method a network administrator may provide one or more DCB configurations in the management IHS . In an embodiment a DCB application and user interface an example of which is illustrated and described below with reference to and may be provided on the management IHS that allows a network administrator or other user of the IHS network to provide a plurality of DCB configuration details that may include the identity of data traffic flows priorities for data traffic flows bandwidth allocations for data traffic flows lossless behavior requests for data traffic flows congestion notification requests for data traffic flows and or a variety of other DCB configuration information known in the art.

The method begins at block where a plurality of switch IHSs that are connected together to provide an IHS network are detected. In an embodiment of block the management IHS detects the plurality of switch IHS and through the management network . For example each of the switch IHSs in the IHS network may register through the management network with the SDN controller in the management IHS . In some examples the management IHS may communicate with the endpoint IHSs and or at block as well to determine their location and connectivity to the IHS network . In this manner the SDN controller in the management IHS is provided a full view of the IHS network including each of the switch IHSs and the network topology.

The method then proceeds to block where a data traffic flow is identified. In an embodiment an endpoint IHS such as the endpoint IHS or the endpoint IHS may start an application that begins a flow session associated with a data traffic flow and at block of the method the management IHS may communicate with the switch IHS that is in the data path of a flow session and identify the data traffic flow associated with that flow session. In such an embodiment the data traffic flow identified at block of the method includes information about the endpoint IHS sending the data traffic flow the endpoint IHS receiving the data traffic flow the type of data traffic included in the data traffic flow and or a variety of other data traffic flow information known in the art. In another embodiment a data traffic flow may be identified by the network administrator or other user prior to the method as discussed above.

The method then proceeds to block where a flow path is determined through the IHS network for the identified traffic flow. In an embodiment the management IHS may use any of the information received about the data traffic flow identified at block of the method to determine a flow path through the IHS network for that data traffic flow. For example the management IHS may use the information about the endpoint IHS sending the data traffic flow and the endpoint IHS receiving the data traffic flow to determine that a flow path exists for the identified data traffic flow between the endpoint IHSs and that includes the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS and the link or links

In an embodiment a plurality of flow paths may be available through the IHS network and the selection of a particular flow path from the plurality of flow paths may be based on the switch IHSs included in the flow path e.g. switch IHSs with bandwidth to support the identified data traffic flow switch IHSs that support DCB switch IHSs that are flow based networking switch IHSs etc. the information received about the type of data traffic included in the identified data traffic flow e.g. a bandwidth needed for the identified data traffic flow a QoS requested for the identified data traffic flow etc. In another embodiment a flow path may be identified that includes only switch IHSs that are flow based networking switch IHSs and those switch IHSs may be selected to provide the flow path. In other embodiments combinations of flow based networking switch IHSs and non flow based networking switch IHSs may be selected for the flow path. In some embodiments the management IHS may determine that a switch IHS includes at least one DCB capable Ethernet traffic port before selecting that switch IHS for a flow path. While a few examples have been provided the determination of a flow path for the identified data traffic flow may be based upon a variety of other information known in the art for routing a data traffic flow between endpoint IHSs.

The method then proceeds to block where the switch IHSs in the flow path determined at block are configured to provide a first QoS for the data traffic flow identified at block . In an embodiment at block the management IHS sends configuration information to each of the switch IHSs in the flow path determined at block and that configuration information causes those switch IHSs to provide a first QoS to the data traffic flow identified at block . In the examples discussed below the flow path discussed with regard to the configuration at block is the flow path between the endpoint IHSs and that includes the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS and the link or links . However configuration of any flow path determined by the management IHS may be similar to that discussed below.

In an embodiment the configuration at block includes the management IHS programming the data traffic flow identified at block into each of the flow based networking switch IHSs that are included in the flow path determined at block . For example the SDN controller in the management IHS may provide configuration information that includes the details of the data traffic flow identified at block to each of the switch IHSs through the management network . In response to receiving the details of the data traffic flow identified at block the switch IHSs may store those details in the data traffic flow table such that the data traffic flow identified at block may be recognized when received at the Ethernet traffic ports on the switch IHSs 

In an embodiment the configuration at block is enabled by extending the conventional OFPT PORT MOD controller command message type in the OpenFlow communications protocol conventionally used to change buffer sizes of Ethernet traffic ports in the switch IHSs that are managed by the SDN controller to allow an SDN controller in the management IHS to use OFPT PORT MOD messages to send a DCB configuration to any of the switch IHSs in the flow path determined at block of the method . Thus at block of the method the SDN controller in the management IHS may send OFPT PORT MOD messages to each of the switch IHSs that include configuration information that the switch IHSs may use to provide QoS to the data traffic flow identified in block .

In an embodiment configuration information provided from the management IHS to the switch IHSs includes data traffic flow bandwidth information that may specify to the switch IHSs a bandwidth to provide the data traffic flow identified at block . For example data traffic flow bandwidth information may specify to a switch IHS a percentage of the total bandwidth available to that switch IHS that should be provided the data traffic flow identified at block a bandwidth amount that should be provided the data traffic flow identified at block and or a variety of other bandwidth allocations known in the art. In an embodiment configuration information provided from the management IHS to the switch IHSs includes data traffic flow priority information that may specify to the switch IHSs a priority to provide the data traffic flow identified at block . For example data traffic flow priority information may specify to a switch IHS a priority that that should be provided the data traffic flow identified at block relative to any other traffic flows received by that switch IHS.

In an embodiment configuration information provided from the management IHS to the switch IHSs includes loss lossless behavior information that may specify to the switch IHSs whether loss or lossless behavior should be provided to the data traffic flow identified at block . For example loss lossless behavior information may specify to a switch IHS whether packets of the data traffic flow identified at block may be dropped or whether each packet of the data traffic flow must be delivered. In an embodiment configuration information provided from the management IHS to the switch IHSs includes congestion information that allows the switch IHSs to send congestion notification messages to endpoint IHSs to slow down or pause the sending of the data traffic flow identified at block when an output queue or buffer space in the switch IHSs begins to get full.

Upon receipt of the configuration information each of the switch IHSs in the flow path determined at block may be configured using the configuration information. For example upon receipt of the OFPT PORT MOD messages from the SDN controller in the management IHS each of the switch IHSs may be configured using the configuration information in those messages to program DCB parameters associated with their DCB capable Ethernet traffic ports that provide the flow path determined at block by using the configuration information to program their hardware queues e.g. the queues discussed above with reference to the switch IHS . For example table A below illustrates a hardware queue of a switch IHS that has been programmed with configuration information for two data traffic flow and 

As can be seen in table A above the hardware queue for the switch IHS has been programmed to handle a maximum number of 8 data traffic flows cap 8 and the configuration information provided at block has allocated 90 of the transmission bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 90 and 10 of the transmission bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 10 . Similarly the configuration information provided at block has allocated 90 of the receiving bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 90 and 10 of the receiving bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 10 . The configuration information provided at block has also prioritized data traffic flow ets prio tc 0 over data traffic flow ets prio tc 1 and prioritized data traffic flow over other data traffic flows ets prio tc 2 received by the switch IHS. The configuration information provided at block also includes the provision of a traffic class for a transmission selection algorithm ets tc tsa 2 for both data traffic flow and data traffic flow which is used to allow excess bandwidth allocated but not being used by a particular data traffic flow or traffic class to be used by another data traffic flow or traffic class.

As illustrated in the method the method may loop back through blocks and such that the management IHS identifies a plurality of a data traffic flows and for each data traffic flow determines a flow path through the IHS network and configures the switch IHSs in that flow path to provide a QoS for the data traffic flow. Thus a first data traffic flow may be identified a first flow path through the IHS network determined for the first data traffic flow and the switch IHSs in the first flow path configured to provide a first QoS for the first data traffic flow followed by a second data traffic flow being identified a second flow path through the IHS network determined for the second data traffic flow and the switch IHSs in the second flow path configured to provide a second QoS for the second data traffic flow and so on. Table A provided above and illustrating the hardware queue in a switch IHS includes a situation in which each of a first data traffic flow and a second data traffic flow have been identified data traffic flow and data traffic flow in the table a first flow path for the first data traffic flow and a second flow path for the second data traffic flow determined that each include that switch IHS and the switch IHS configured to provide a first QoS for the first data traffic flow 90 transmission and receive bandwidth and highest priority for data traffic flow and a second QoS for the second data traffic flow 10 transmission and receive bandwidth and lower priority for data traffic flow relative to data traffic flow .

Using the table provided above illustrating the hardware queue in a switch IHS that has been configured according to the method the operation of the IHS network to provide data traffic flows between endpoint IHSs may be described. In this example data traffic flow in the table is sent from endpoint IHS to endpoint IHS over a flow path that includes the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS and the link or links . Similarly data traffic flow in the table is sent from endpoint IHS to endpoint IHS over the same flow path that includes the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS the link or links the switch IHS and the link or links . This example also includes each switch IHS configured the same i.e. the hardware queues programmed as detailed in table A above. 

In operation each switch IHS operates to receive both data traffic flow and data traffic flow e.g. from the endpoint IHSs and or from other switch IHSs recognize each of data traffic flow and data traffic flow based on matches of packets provided in those data traffic flows with the details of data traffic flow and data traffic flow in the data traffic flow table in the switch IHS e.g. the flow table discussed above with reference to . Upon receipt and recognition of data traffic flow and data traffic flow each switch operates according to its hardware queues programmed as per the table above to prioritize data traffic over data traffic and then allocate 90 of its available bandwidth in both receiving and transmitting data traffic while allocating 10 of its available bandwidth in receiving and transmitting data traffic . In this manner a first QoS is provided in transmitting data traffic from the endpoint IHS and over the flow path to the endpoint while a second QoS is provided in transmitting data traffic from the endpoint IHS and over the flow path to the endpoint

The method may then proceed to optional block where switch IHSs in one or more flow paths may be reconfigured to provide a modified QoS for a data traffic flow associated with the flow path that includes those switch IHSs. In an embodiment a network administrator may modify how a data traffic flow or flows are handled by the IHS network simply by reconfiguring the switch IHSs in the flow path or paths associated with those data traffic flow s from the management IHS . For example using the management IHS the network administrator may change the configuration for any or all of the switch IHSs in a flow path or flow paths to change the QoS provided to one or more data traffic flows e.g. by sending OFPT PORT MOD messages that include the new configuration information from the SDN controller in the management IHS to each of the switch IHSs A specific example is provided below in table B that illustrates the hardware queue of the switch IHS that was provided in table A above but that that has been reprogrammed with new configuration information for its two data traffic flow and at optional block 

As can be seen in table B above the hardware queue for the switch IHS has been reprogrammed with updated configuration information provided at block to allocate 50 of the transmission bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 50 and 50 of the transmission bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 50 . Similarly the updated configuration information provided at block has allocated 50 of the receiving bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 50 and 50 of the receiving bandwidth of the switch IHS to data traffic flow ets tc tx bw 50 . One of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that the priority of data traffic and data traffic relative to each other and or other data traffic received by the switch IHS may be changed at optional block as well.

In some embodiments switch IHSs may be added or removed from the IHS network . When a switch IHS is added to the IHS network that switch IHS may register through the management network with the SDN controller in the management IHS similarly as described above with reference to block and that switch IHS may then be determined to be part of a flow path and configured e.g. via OFPT PORT MOD messages as described above with reference to blocks and . In addition at any time a network administrator or other user may provide a new DCB configuration that includes for example a plurality of DCB configuration details that may include the identity of a new data traffic flow a priority for that new data traffic flow a bandwidth allocation for that new data traffic flow a lossless behavior request for that new data traffic flow a congestion notification request for that new data traffic flow and or a variety of other DCB configuration information known in the art and in response blocks may be repeated to determine a flow path for the new data traffic flow and configure the switch IHSs in that flow path i.e. with the flow details and the QoS details. 

Referring now to and an embodiment of a management IHS is illustrated which may be the management IHS discussed above with reference to that includes a display device displaying screens from a DCB IHS network management application. In the embodiment illustrated in the DCB IHS network management application includes a data traffic flow management screen that includes a plurality of data traffic flow sections and each associated with a data traffic flow that may have been identified at block of the method . Each data traffic flow section and includes a respective flow path illustration and that includes the flow path devices that were determined at block for the data traffic flow associated with that data traffic flow section. Each data traffic flow section and also includes inputs to allow a configuration for the associated data traffic flow to be provided including a priority input a minimum bandwidth input a lossless selector and a congestion notification selector. In one example of the method at block the data traffic flow may be identified and populated in the data traffic flow section . At block the flow path for data traffic flow may then be determined and the flow path illustration populated in the data traffic flow section . The network administrator may then use an input device on the management IHS to provide inputs in the priority input the minimum bandwidth input the lossless selector and or the congestion notification selector as illustrated and in response the management IHS may send the configuration information to the switch IHSs in the flow path for the data traffic flow as discussed above. The method may be performed similarly for each of the data traffic flow and the data traffic flow in the data traffic flow sections and respectively. Furthermore at any time the network administrator may use the data traffic flow management screen to reconfigure switch IHSs in a flow path to change the QoS for any data traffic flow by providing inputs in the priority input the minimum bandwidth input the lossless selector and or the congestion notification selector for that data traffic flow.

In the embodiment illustrated in the DCB IHS network management application includes a switch IHS management screen that includes a plurality of switch IHS sections and each associated with a switch IHS that is handling one or more data traffic flows. Each switch IHS sections and includes data traffic flow section that identifies a data traffic flow being handled by that switch along with inputs that allow a configuration for each respective data traffic flow to be provided including a transmission bandwidth input a receiving bandwidth input a priority input a lossless selector and a congestion notification selector. In one embodiment any of the flow path illustrations may be selected on the data traffic flow management screen of and in response the switch IHS management screen may be provided that allows any switch in the flow path associated with the selected flow path illustration to be configured. In response to receiving inputs on the switch IHS management screen the management IHS operates according to block of the method to send corresponding configuration information to the appropriate switch IHS. Thus at any time the network administrator may use the switch IHS management screen to reconfigure any switch IHS in the IHS network to change the QoS for any data traffic flow by providing inputs in the priority input the minimum bandwidth input the lossless selector and or the congestion notification selector for that data traffic flow.

Thus systems and methods for providing a DCB IHS network have been described that utilize flow based networking to configure and manage DCB in a large scale multi hop IHS network. One of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that in fully flow based networking environment i.e. environments in which each switch IHS is a flow based networking switch the need for DCBX via link layer discovery protocols LLDPs is eliminated while being partially eliminated in hybrid environments discussed below as the configuration of DCB is automated and managed from a central location at the management IHS. The systems and methods described herein also eliminated the need for identifying priority traffic via Priority Code Point PCP values described in the IEEE 802.1p specification in the 802.1 Tag Control Info 2 bytes header.

Referring back to in some embodiments at least one of the switch IHSs included in the flow path determined at block of the method may include a non flow based networking switch IHS. For example for a flow path that includes the switch IHSs each of the switch IHSs and may be flow based networking switch IHSs while the switch IHS may be a non flow based networking switch IHS. In such a hybrid IHS network the flow based networking switch IHSs may operate to allow the method discussed above by performing the tagging and untagging of Ethernet packets sent to and received from the non flow based networking switch IHS. For example each of the flow based networking switch IHSs and may be configured according to the method while the non flow based networking switch IHS may be configured conventionally by a network administrator. In operation when the switch IHS receives a data traffic flow from either of the endpoint IHSs or the switch IHS will operate to tag Ethernet packets that are to be sent to the switch IHS e.g. to indicate the priority of those Ethernet packets while the switch IHS will operate to untag those Ethernet packets received from the switch IHS before forwarding the data traffic flow to the switch IHS . Thus while the embodiments discussed above with reference to were directed to a fully flow based networking environment i.e. each flow path determined involved Ethernet traffic ports that were SDN capable hybrid flow based and non flow based networking environments may be enabled as well.

Although illustrative embodiments have been shown and described a wide range of modification change and substitution is contemplated in the foregoing disclosure and in some instances some features of the embodiments may be employed without a corresponding use of other features. Accordingly it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the embodiments disclosed herein.
