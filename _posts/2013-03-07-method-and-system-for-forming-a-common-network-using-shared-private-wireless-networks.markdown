Service providers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by providing compelling network systems and services. One area of particular interest involves management of network resources namely bandwidth to ensure high network performance and availability even for the consumer level market as opposed to enterprise customers . Consumers have adapted to the availability of broadband services by deploying high speed private networks to access a multitude of sophisticated services thereby placing greater strain on resources of the network service providers. With the increasing use of the network resources by user devices to access games movies and other data intensive applications bandwidth management can become problematic in bandwidth constrained environments. These user devices such as smartphones or tablets are generally able to connect to a cellular network as well as a wireless network e.g. WiFi and thus can consume resources of either networks. However little attention has been focused on managing such usage from the perspective of the service provider as the interests of the end users and the service providers are generally in opposition.

Based on the foregoing there is a need for better utilization of network resources while enhancing coordination of resources of the end users network and the network of the service provider.

An apparatus method and software for forming a common network using shared private wireless networks is described. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

Although the various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to WiFi technology it is contemplated these embodiments have applicability to equivalent technology e.g. Bluetooth etc. .

It is noted that user devices may be any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer Personal Digital Assistants PDAs smartphone or any combination thereof. Also for the purpose of illustration herein customer premise nodes may include routers gateways servers wireless access points or any other devices configured at a premise such as an office or home for providing network access to the user devices . As will be discussed further the customer premise nodes e.g. access points or nodes may be configured for enabling the sharing of bandwidth with a device subscribed to the network .

With the increasing use of the network resources by user devices to access games movies and other data intensive applications bandwidth management can become problematic in bandwidth constrained environments. Consequently service providers are challenged to effectively manage the limited bandwidth capacity of their network . One way for the provider to meet demand is to charge customers more money for access to the network or to impose bandwidth limits on requesting devices . However while this approach may inhibit use of the network at least temporarily it does not solve the issue of constrained bandwidth capacity. Another option for the service provider is to expand the infrastructure of the network in an effort to make more bandwidth available for use by user devices . This approach however can be time consuming and costly for the service provide. Unfortunately there is currently no convenient means by which a service provider network may better utilize its network resources while enhancing coordination of resources of the end users network.

To address this issue system presents a shared access platform that enables multiple customer premise nodes to form a common network for enabling user device network access. By way of example the shared access platform operates in connection with different customer premise nodes referred to herein collectively as nodes according to a shared access scheme for formulating the common network . In addition the shared access platform enables the nodes to be detected by respective user devices referred to herein as user devices per the common network . Under this scenario an amount of bandwidth maintained by the customer premise nodes or private networks thereof is made available for use by a requesting user device that is subscribed to the service provider network . The shared access scheme for formulating the common network may include data exchange between the nodes and the shared access platform for indicating permission to form the common network the amount of bandwidth to be made available bandwidth access settings such as schedule information and the like.

As noted in the private network may be assigned a private internet protocol IP address space per a known Internet addressing architecture for supporting wireless e.g. Wi Fi or wired communication. As such any user devices having the appropriate credentials and or permissions to the private network may access the assigned address space and bandwidth of the network i.e. for supporting wireless networking tasks using Wi Fi or other related wireless communication protocols. In certain embodiments the shared access platform enables the private network or node to be utilized by user devices having access to the common network e.g. those user devices subscribed with the provider of the network . Hence even devices unrelated to the private network and resources thereof may perform network related tasks e.g. access the Internet via the common network configuration seamlessly. From the perspective of the user the user device may utilize the bandwidth of the common network i.e. the aggregation of shared bandwidth of private networks as if the bandwidth was directly from the service provider network .

In certain embodiments the shared access scheme for enabling formation of the common network may be established between the nodes and the service provider network based on an incentive model. For example the user of the nodes private networks may be a subscriber to the service provider network wherein various devices of the user are configured to access the network . Under this scenario the user may be offered service or customer related incentives e.g. discounts credits special offers in exchange for agreeing to participate in the common network . As another example the user may be a non subscriber to the service provider network that is registered only with the shared access platform for receiving various incentives. In either case the shared access platform may enable facilitation of the common network among respective nodes carry based on the generation and or processing of permission settings. Of note the shared access platform may be accessed as a hosted solution or as a module for direct execution with the nodes and user devices .

In certain embodiments the shared access platform maintains permission settings for specifying acknowledgement of the agreement between the nodes and the provider of the network to enable bandwidth sharing e.g. via the common network . By way of example the sharing of bandwidth includes enabling upon request IP address space associated with or maintained by said nodes to be utilized by the requesting device as a resource of the service provider. In this way the user device that initiates the request accesses the bandwidth associated with the private network as if it were that of the service provider network . In addition the permission settings may indicate an amount of bandwidth to be shared accessed by the user devices via access to the common network . For example the setting may be established by the user of the nodes or prearranged as a fixed percentage. Still further the permission settings may also specify a schedule in which user devices are permitted to access bandwidth via nodes . As such the settings may specify dates and or times in which the nodes are restricted and or permitted for access.

It is noted that the scheduling may be executed in conjunction with the amount of bandwidth to be shared for enabling customized distribution and regulation of the bandwidth of the private network by respective nodes . As such the common network may be formulated with respect to nodes without monopolizing the entire bandwidth capacity of the nodes. Rather the common network serves as a wireless overlay through which the service provider network is accessed by subscribed user devices .

Still further the permission settings may also specify the generation and sharing of usage reports. In certain embodiments the usage reports may include data and statistics for indicating usage of respective nodes within the common network . Alternatively the usage reports may include data for indicating the usage or accessing of one or more nodes of the common network by respective user devices . The usage reports may be reported to the user of nodes user devices as well as provided periodically to the service provider network for analysis. By way of example the service provider may determine the popularity or lack thereof of a given area or node configured to the shared access platform . Based on this information the service provider may make current or future network access decisions or adapt an incentive model associated with the user of said nodes . As another example the user of a device may determine the most or least popular areas nodes they connect to as a basis for future connectivity needs.

It is noted the permission settings may be established by a user of the nodes through execution of an application referred to herein collectively as application of user devices . By way of example the application may render a user interface at the device for enabling user registration with the shared access platform . Per the interface a user of the customer premise nodes may enter the permission settings via one or more data fields user selection fields action buttons or the like. This may include initiating the permission settings for the first time or initiating execution of prior established permission settings. In addition the application may also feature instructions for enabling node detection as well as for facilitating pass through authentication for the detected nodes . For the purpose of illustration the nodes which are configured to the shared access platform per the shared access scheme are referred to herein as participating nodes .

In addition during an initial registration with the platform the user may further request a downloading or installing of a sharing application referred to herein collectively as sharing applications at the nodes . The sharing application may be implemented as a module for implementing a firewall between respective private networks and the service provider network . By way of this approach the sharing application ensures traffic associated with the different networks is segregated. As such the nodes within the common network are prevented from unwarranted access by user devices outside of the address space allocated for execution of the common network .

In addition the sharing application enables the node to broadcast two different service set identifiers SSIDs for indicating the presence of the private network node and the service provider network . As such broadcasting of the service set identifiers enables the respective networks to be detected by user devices . One SSID may indicate the private network while the other is detected as a wireless access point and or hotspot for the provider of the network i.e. the common network . In this case detection of the SSIDs may occur when the requesting user device is within range of the node i.e. as configured within a premise. The shared access platform may also maintain a list of the various private networks and or nodes for a given geographic region or area. This list may be referenced against location information gathered by sensors of respective devices for identifying nodes and associated private networks that are configured to formulate a common network .

In certain embodiments when the shared access platform receives a request from a user device for connectivity to the common network the shared access platform performs an authentication procedure. The request may be passed to the platform via a network component of the service provider network such as a network access gateway. Per the authentication procedure the platform determines whether the user device has the appropriate permissions and credentials for accessing the network . This may include retrieving a subscriber profile for the device as maintained by the service provider. In addition the authentication may include processing location information for the user device or signal strength information related to connectivity of the user device with a node to determine whether any participating nodes are available for access in response to a request. It is noted that the signal strength location information and other contextual data may be detected by the user device based on one or more sensors .

Still further the shared access platform determines whether the permission settings for the node are suitable for permitting common network access. For example in the case where the request is received at 8 am the shared access platform checks the permission settings for corresponding schedule information related to the node to determine if bandwidth is available at the time of request. It is noted the above described authentication steps may be performed seamlessly without the need for user intervention. Rather once the device is authenticated the device accesses the service provider network via the common network .

In another embodiment the shared access platform operates in connection with the user device and nodes to manage the user device handoff process. The handoff process pertains to the redirecting of a point of connection to the network . Hence in this scenario the shared access platform ensures a device connection to the common network as established via a first node is seamlessly redirected to a second node in response to a change in location and or proximity of the user device . In addition the handoff may be initiated by the shared access platform in response to a determined change in signal strength with respect to a given node . It is noted that the signal strength is based at least in part on the proximity of the user device to the nodes interference factors etc.

By way of example the shared access platform periodically receives a report for indicating its relative signal strength with respect to a current participating node . The report may be generated by the application of the user device as it communicates with and or detects a node . When the received signal strength is determined to meet a predetermined signal level threshold the shared access platform initiates a redirecting of the user device to another participating node having a higher signal strength. For example in response to the report that participating node features weak signal strength a connection with node having a signal strength greater than the predetermined threshold may be formulated. It is noted during this handoff procedure that data can be buffered by the network component e.g. a network access gateway or by the user device until the handoff procedure is complete.

In certain embodiments the signal strength of nodes relative to a requesting user device may also be analyzed by the shared access platform for enabling selection of a node to initially connect. The selection of a node may be based for example on signal strength. As such when a device is determined to be in a certain service area of the network the signal strength may be utilized as a determining factor for selecting participating available nodes within the service area for establishing the common network .

Also in certain embodiments the bandwidth availability of the participating nodes is reported to the shared access platform on a periodic basis. By way of example the sharing application may be configured to generate the report for indicating current or excess bandwidth of different nodes . As such the bandwidth availability may be periodically analyzed by the shared access platform to determine a node to connect a device to. It is noted that the selection and node availability may also be based upon context information for the device including timing information and location information.

As a result of the reporting the shared access platform is able to maintain current historical bandwidth capacity data for all of the participating customer premise nodes within a given service area. In addition the platform has access to signal strength information. Hence in the case of multiple nodes being available to a requesting user device for a given location the shared access platform may select and or handoff a node based upon one or more of the following criteria current excess bandwidth availability preference settings of a user of nodes the history of excess bandwidth availability of nodes within a given service area a specific incentive arrangement between the service provider and the user of nodes e.g. an agreement that traffic use is not to exceed a certain amount of gigabytes per month .

In certain embodiments the shared access platform may develop capacity plans usage predictions usage models metrics etc. pertaining to the nodes or user devices for a given service area. The plans models etc. may be developed based on the reports generated along with information regarding permission settings of respective nodes or access settings of the user devices . By way of this intelligible data the service provider may make decisions about how to allocate network resources or where and how to expand their infrastructure based on factors such as the bandwidth capacity afforded by participating nodes the amount of nodes participating by area region peak and off peak usage periods etc.

It is noted the above described system enables a service provider network to leverage the often under utilized bandwidth capacity of respective nodes . By accessing the common network established by nodes via the permission settings the bandwidth of the private networks e.g. user configured Wi Fi networks may be employed for use by devices subscribed to the service provider network . In addition bandwidth of can be contributed within the common network in a secure manner without jeopardizing the privacy or integrity of the private networks. It is noted that the shared access platform may be implemented as a hosted solution for access via the network as an integrated modular solution of a user device or node or a combination thereof.

In certain embodiments user devices the shared access platform and other elements of system may be configured to communicate via a service provider network . According to certain embodiments one or more networks such as data network telephony network and or wireless network can interact with the service provider network . Networks may be any suitable wireline and or wireless network and be managed by one or more service providers. For example telephony network may include a circuit switched network such as the public switched telephone network PSTN an integrated services digital network ISDN a private branch exchange PBX or other like network.

Networks may employ various technologies for enabling wireless communication including for example code division multiple access CDMA long term evolution LTE enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS mobile ad hoc network MANET global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like. Meanwhile data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN the Internet or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network such as a proprietary cable or fiber optic network.

Still further the communication provider network may embody circuit switched and or packet switched networks that include facilities to provide for transport of circuit switched and or packet based communications. It is further contemplated that networks may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner the communication network may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 SS7 network Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.

In one embodiment an authentication module authenticates user devices for interaction with the shared access platform . In addition the authentication module enables the registration of one or more nodes for interaction with the platform i.e. for enabling formulation of a common network in association with the service provider network . By way of example in the case of a user device the authentication module receives a request to access or acquire an application for detecting one or more participating nodes . The application may be downloaded per the registration procedure or otherwise activated for use at the user device . The authentication process may also include enabling the sharing of context information by the sensors of the registered devices.

Still further in the case of nodes that are to participate in the shared access scheme the authentication module facilitates the activating and or loading of the sharing application . It is contemplated that the authentication module may operate in connection with the sharing application to facilitate configuration of the various participating nodes.

It is noted the registration procedure may be performed through automated association of profile information maintained by a provider of the network with an IP address a carrier detection signal of a user device mobile directory number MDN subscriber identity module SIM e.g. of a SIM card radio frequency identifier RFID tag or other identifier. Under this scenario the authentication module may operate in connection with the communication module to facilitate the retrieval of the profile information.

Still further the authentication module receives requests from devices for establishing a network connection via the participating nodes . By way of example the authentication module passes the request to the permissions settings module accordingly. In addition the authentication module may perform a validation of the application at the device to determine the user has the ability to interact with the participating nodes . Still further the request may indicate by device identifier the particular nodes to which the user is within range of or to which the request for connectivity to the common network originates.

In one embodiment the permission settings module operates in connection with the user interface module to permit the receipt and storing of permission settings related to a node . By way of example the permissions settings module causes the user interface module to present user input options for specifying the bandwidth to be shared with requesting user devices. In addition the module causes settings for specifying the availability of nodes to be rendered to a display of a device. Once retrieved the input is then stored to a permission settings record corresponding to the participating node. It is noted that the permissions settings may be further associated with profile information of a subscribed user device e.g. as maintained by the provider of the network in instances where the nodes and device are related to the same user.

Still further the permission settings module also initiates retrieval of the permission settings for a node corresponding to a request for access to the network . The retrieval may include performing a lookup within the database for an identifier corresponding to the node wherein the identifier is maintained for indicating an agreement for the node to be used by user devices for connecting with the service provider network . In addition the permission settings module may retrieve corresponding scheduling information associated with the node an amount of bandwidth to be made available e.g. expressed as a percentage or a combination thereof. Once retrieved the permission settings values are passed on to the sharing module which initiates the connection request based on the permission settings accordingly. It is noted that the permissions settings enable the extent of and or availability of respective nodes for enabling a common network .

In certain embodiments the sharing module compares the permission settings values received from the permission settings module against context information associated with the user device . The context information is determined based on a processing of context information captured by sensors of device . By way of example the context information may include temporal information location information or the like. Also in certain implementations the context processing module may process signal strength information as conveyed by the nodes and or the user devices . By way of this approach the sharing module compares the temporal information against scheduling information to determine the availability of the corresponding node. When the node is available the sharing module then initiates a connection between the user device and the corresponding node thus facilitating access to the service provider network via the common network .

In one embodiment the user interface module enables presentment of a graphical user interface for enabling user registration with the shared access platform . In addition the user interface module enables rendering of a permission settings interface for receiving user input for specifying the settings of the accessing user device or a participating node. By way of example the user interface module generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces APIs or other function calls corresponding to the application of the user devices or sharing application of the nodes thus enabling the display of graphics primitives. It is noted that the user interface module may support the configuration of a user device e.g. a tablet device for accessing a common network a user device for participating within the common network e.g. a wireless router device or both.

In one embodiment a communication module enables formation of a session over a network between the sharing access platform and the application of respective user devices . By way of example the communication module executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling data exchange over the network . It is noted that the communication module may also operate in connection with the context processing module to support the retrieval of reports from the nodes including reports for indicating bandwidth capacity or signal strength relative to a user device . The communication module may be configured to retrieve the reports according to a specified period.

Also in one embodiment a handoff management module is configured to manage a handoff procedure of respective nodes. By way of example the handoff management module ensures a device connection to the network as established via a first node is seamlessly redirected to a second node in response to a change in location and or proximity of the user device . In addition the handoff may be initiated in response to a determined change in signal strength via the context processing module for a given node wherein the signal strength is determined based on the reports gathered by the communication module . As such the handoff may be set to occur when a predetermined signal strength threshold is met i.e. the module initiates the handoff when the signal strength diminishes to a certain level.

In one embodiment the access point selection module is configured to determine a node to select for enabling network access. As in the case of the handoff management module the signal strength may be analyzed by the module . The module then initiates a connection to the common network via the node that is determined to have the highest signal strength relative to the requesting user device . In addition the access point selection module may determine a selection based on permission settings associated with the nodes such as scheduling information and other availability factors.

The above presented modules and components of the shared access platform can be implemented in hardware firmware software or a combination thereof. For example though depicted as a separate entity in it is contemplated the shared access platform may be implemented for direct operation by respective devices . As such the shared access platform may generate direct signal inputs by way of the operating system of the user device for interacting with the application and interfacing with a corresponding sharing application of nodes . In another embodiment one or more of the modules may be implemented for operation by respective devices as a hosted solution.

In step the shared access platform receives a request from a user device for connectivity to a wireless service provider network formed by a plurality of customer premise nodes . As noted previously the customer premise nodes may include network devices such as routers servers or gateways configured within a customer premise such as a home or office. In another step the platform authenticates in response to the request the user device for access to the wireless service provider network based on permission settings established for the plurality of nodes in association with the wireless service provider network. It is noted that each of the nodes is associated with a first identifier and a second identifier wherein the first identifier is associated with a private wireless network associated with the nodes . The second identifier is used for access to the wireless service provider network. The second identifier for example may correspond to the common network which serves as a wireless overlay network or extension of the service provider network .

In step of process the shared access platform receives a subscription request to join the wireless service provider network. As noted the subscription request may be received by the platform in response to user device detection of a participating node of the common network . In another step the platform adds a new customer premise node to the wireless service provider network in response to the subscription request. Hence the node may be enabled for access by requesting user devices for establishment of a common network configuration with other participating nodes . It is noted the subscription request includes permission settings corresponding to the new customer premise node.

In step of process the shared access platform receives a message from one of the customer premise nodes or the user device indicating bandwidth availability of the one customer premise node signal strength relating to connectivity of the user device with the one customer premise node or a combination thereof. As mentioned previously the signal strength may be based at least in part on the proximity of the user device to the nodes interference factors etc. In step the platform determines based on the received message the bandwidth availability signal strength or a combination thereof satisfies a predetermined threshold. In another step the platform initiates a handoff procedure to permit another one of the customer premise nodes to serve the user device based on the determination. Still further in step the platform buffers traffic associated with the user device as part of the handoff procedure.

In step of process the shared access platform assigns the customer premise nodes to respective serving areas of the wireless service provider network . It is noted that the serving areas may indicate for example the locations of known common networks associated with the service provider network. In another step the platform maintains a log of usage of the customer premise nodes for the respective serving areas. In yet another step the platform modifies the assignment of the customer premise nodes to the serving areas based on the permission settings the log or a combination thereof. As noted previously the permission settings may include user preference information e.g. node availability times or dates or bandwidth availability information for the respective customer premise nodes.

In step of process the shared access platform receives traffic from the user device for transmission over the wireless service provider network. By way of example the traffic originates from one of the customer premise nodes. Per the security feature of the shared access platform the one customer premise node may be configured to segregate the traffic from other traffic associated with a corresponding private wireless network. It is noted the private wireless network and the service provider network may be associated with a first service set identifier and second service set identifier respectively for enabling detection and delineation of the respective networks by user devices .

In step of process the shared access platform initiates at a user device a request for connectivity to a wireless service provider network formed by a plurality of customer premise nodes . Per step the platform detects in response to the request a first identifier and a second identifier associated with each of the nodes the first identifier being associated with a private wireless network and the second identifier being used for access to the wireless service provider network. As noted previously the user device is prohibited from access to the private wireless network. The separation of the networks is made possible by way of firewall settings established between the networks accordingly.

In step of produces the user device generates a message for indicating signal strength relating to connectivity of the user device with one of the customer premise nodes. In another step the user device then initiates connectivity with another one of the customer premise nodes based on the signal strength i.e. low signal strength. As mentioned previously the request is associated with a handoff procedure.

In the user activates a permission settings interface of the shared access platform . The permission settings interface features different selection options for configuring permissions i.e. for affecting access to nodes per the shared access scheme. Under this scenario the nodes to be configured already have the sharing application activated accordingly thus the nodes are suited to enable a firewall protection mechanism as well as enable broadcasting of distinct network IP address information. By way of example the user is presented with a caption for indicating the terms of the sharing agreement. The caption may specify details regarding the sharing arrangement between the nodes associated with the user the service provider network specific incentives to be rendered etc. The user may also be presented with a YES or NO checkboxes e.g. checkbox for indicating permission agreement to the terms .

In addition the user may be presented with a YES or NO checkbox for indicating permission agreement to allow the sharing of reports with the shared access platform . The reporting may include the periodic sharing of bandwidth and signal strength information by the nodes that formulate the common network and or a requesting user device that accesses the network . Also the user may specify an amount of bandwidth to be allowed for access by way of an increase decrease selection button .

Still further the user is presented with a settings link for enabling the customization of schedule information relative to the nodes. While not shown expressly in the diagram upon selection of the settings link calendar may be rendered to the interface e.g. per execution of a calendar widget . Per the calendar the user may select specific days and or time frames to permit and or restrict access to the nodes associated with their private network. Once these settings are configured the user may then select the SAVE action button to save the settings and have them stored to the permission settings database . Alternatively the user may select the EXIT action button to exit from the interface .

In the mobile device is configured with an application for enabling it to detect nodes configured to the shared access platform . As such when the user initiates a request for execution of movie content the service set identifiers SSIDs corresponding to the participating node relative to the location of the device and that of the service provider network are detected. For the purpose of illustration two different SSIDs are shown via caption for representing the private and service provider network respectively. It is noted however that the identifiers need not be presented to the user or via the interface. Rather the connection with the service provider network per the request may be carried out seamlessly resulting in execution of the movie based at least in part on bandwidth provided by the selected node. The selected node is therefore the means of user access to a common network a wireless network through which the device may access the service provider network.

In the shared access platform interacts with a device as the user travels about a given area. Under this scenario the device is within range of different wireless access points WAPs or nodes configured within different premises per a private network arrangement. For the purpose of illustration the WAPs also have permission settings per the sharing software established with the service provider network . It is noted the sharing software may be activated at the device per a subscription procedure and may include the exchange of device identifier information network address information and other information with the shared access platform .

By way of example the sharing platform cross references permission settings of the nodes corresponding to the service area to determine availability access permissions and bandwidth sharing settings for the different WAPs. Once determined the platform further determines the relative signal strength of the different WAPs with the signal strengths being depicted by signal strength indicators respectively. In addition the platform determines the bandwidth availability of the different WAPs as depicted by bandwidth indicators . As noted previously the signal strength and bandwidth is based on reports generated by the nodes and or the user device relative to interaction with the nodes .

Under this scenario the node featuring the best combination of availability factors is used for formulation of the network connection. Hence this corresponds to node which based on the current location of the device and relative signal strength the permission settings and bandwidth availability represents the most reliable connectivity point. In however a handoff procedure is executed in response to a change in selection factors including a change in location of the device and thus relative signal strength. Also per this example the bandwidth availability of the original node is shown to have diminished over time. Hence given the relative signal strength bandwidth availability and permission settings of nodes for the serving area the platform is able to determine node is best suited for formulating the connection. As such the connection established with the network via node e.g. of a common network is formulated via node . It is noted that the periodicity of the reported signal strength and bandwidth availability may be adapted accordingly to accommodate different handoff scenarios.

It is contemplated in future embodiments that the shared access platform may be configured to operate in connection with a route planning or navigation application. Under this scenario route information and mapping information may be generated for indicating those service areas having the densest concentrations of available and or participating nodes highest bandwidth availabilities etc. In addition routes may be determined based on bandwidth availability factors or other criteria for supporting optimized access to the service provider network .

The processes described herein for forming a common network using shared private wireless networks may be implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

The computer system may be coupled via the bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display active matrix display or plasma display for displaying information to a computer user. An input device such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to the bus for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor and for adjusting cursor movement on the display .

According to an embodiment of the invention the processes described herein are performed by the computer system in response to the processor executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory from another computer readable medium such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory causes the processor to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multiprocessing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . The communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link connected to a local network . For example the communication interface may be a digital subscriber line DSL card or modem an integrated services digital network ISDN card a cable modem a telephone modem or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card e.g. for Ethernet or an Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM network to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further the communication interface can include peripheral interface devices such as a Universal Serial Bus USB interface a PCMCIA Personal Computer Memory Card International Association interface etc. Although a single communication interface is depicted in multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.

The network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example the network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer which has connectivity to a network e.g. a wide area network WAN or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network and the network both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link and through the communication interface which communicate digital data with the computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.

The computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s the network link and the communication interface . In the Internet example a server not shown might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network the local network and the communication interface . The processor may execute the transmitted code while being received and or store the code in the storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner the computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to computer readable storage medium or non transitory i.e. non volatile media and volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic optical or electromagnetic waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM CDRW DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape optical mark sheets any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device such as a personal digital assistant PDA or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA not shown one or more controllers not shown or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes merely one or more processors and some software and or firmware supporting and or relating to and or for the one or more processors.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to enable a common network using shared private wireless networks. The memory also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.

While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description. Accordingly the invention is not limited to such embodiments but rather to the broader scope of the presented claims and various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements.
