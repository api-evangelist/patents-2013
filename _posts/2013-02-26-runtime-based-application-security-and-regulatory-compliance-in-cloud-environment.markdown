The present application relates generally to an improved data processing apparatus and method and more specifically to mechanisms for runtime based application security and regulatory compliance in a cloud computing environment.

Cloud computing is the use of computing resources hardware and software that are delivered as a service over a network typically the Internet . Cloud computing entrusts remote services with a user s data software and computation. Using software as a service users also rent application software and databases. The cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms on which the applications run. End users may access cloud based applications through a web browser or a light weight desktop or mobile app while the business software and user data are stored on servers at a remote location.

In the software as a service SaaS model cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. The cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform on which the application is running. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user s own computers simplifying maintenance and support. What makes a cloud application different from other applications is its elasticity. This can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run time to meet the changing work demand. Load balancers distribute the work over a set of virtual machines. This process is inconspicuous to the cloud user who sees only a single access point.

An application runtime system or runtime environment is a software component designed to support the execution of computer applications written in some computer language. The application runtime contains implementations of basic low level commands and may also implement higher level commands and may support type checking debugging and even code generation and optimization.

An application runtime relieves programmers from the burden of writing code for mundane tasks such as drawing text on the screen or making an Internet connection. It also provides an abstraction layer that hides the complexity or variations in the services offered by the operating system.

In one illustrative embodiment a method in a data processing system is provided for runtime based application security. The method comprises receiving by an application runtime environment executing within a virtual machine on the data processing system notification of a change in execution environment for the virtual machine. The method further comprises responsive to determining the virtual machine is being migrated to a virtualized environment based on the notification of a change in execution environment dynamically modifying by the application runtime environment execution of an application in the application runtime environment wherein the application comprises a set of application modules.

In other illustrative embodiments a computer program product comprising a computer useable or readable medium having a computer readable program is provided. The computer readable program when executed on a computing device causes the computing device to perform various ones of and combinations of the operations outlined above with regard to the method illustrative embodiment.

In yet another illustrative embodiment a system apparatus is provided. The system apparatus may comprise one or more processors and a memory coupled to the one or more processors. The memory may comprise instructions which when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to perform various ones of and combinations of the operations outlined above with regard to the method illustrative embodiment.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be described in or will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the following detailed description of the example embodiments of the present invention.

The illustrative embodiments provide a mechanism for runtime based application security and regulatory compliance in a cloud computing environment. The application runtime is notified of its execution environment to allow the application runtime to dynamically modify its behavior. If an application executing in the application runtime environment processes or generates very sensitive data which is not safe to handle in a virtualized execution environment the application runtime may selectively disable only those application modules and services that deal with such data in a virtualized environment.

Each application module may have an attribute that indicates whether the module can be run in a virtualized or cloud environment. The application runtime before loading the application modules may check the attribute and compare it with runtime environment details. Based on the attribute value the application runtime can load the module or disable its loading. Additionally if the application runtime decides to not load a given application module based on its attribute value the application runtime may query a service registry to get a version of the module with specific functionality suitable for the specific runtime environment if available. The application runtime may also query a trusted module object registry to deploy application modules that provide needed functionality with enhanced security for example as per the changes in the execution environment.

It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least live characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or datacenter .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based email . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds .

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

Referring now to a schematic of an example of a cloud computing node is shown. Cloud computing node is only one example of a suitable cloud computing node and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the invention described herein. Regardless cloud computing node is capable of being implemented and or performing any of the functionality set forth hereinabove.

In cloud computing node there is a computer system server which is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems environments and or configurations that may be suitable for use with computer system server include but are not limited to personal computer systems server computer systems thin clients thick clients handheld or laptop devices multiprocessor systems microprocessor based systems set top boxes programmable consumer electronics network PCs minicomputer systems mainframe computer systems and distributed cloud computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices and the like.

Computer system server may be described in the general context of computer system executable instructions such as program modules being executed by a computer system. Generally program modules may include routines programs objects components logic data structures and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer system server may be practiced in distributed cloud computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed cloud computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.

As shown in computer system server in cloud computing node is shown in the form of a general purpose computing device. The components of computer system server may include but are not limited to one or more processors or processing units a system memory and a bus that couples various system components including system memory to processor .

Computer system server may also communicate with one or more external devices such as a keyboard a pointing device a display etc. one or more devices that enable a user to interact with computer system server and or any devices e.g. network card modem etc. that enable computer system server to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via Input Output I O interfaces . Still yet computer system server can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network TAN a general wide area network WAN and or a public network e.g. the Internet via network adapter .

Nodes may communicate with one another. They may be grouped not shown physically or virtually in one or more networks such as Private Community Public or Hybrid clouds as described hereinabove or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment to offer infrastructure platforms and or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A N shown in are intended to be illustrative only and that computing nodes and cloud computing environment can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and or network addressable connection e.g. using a web browser .

Open Services Gateway Initiative OSGi framework is a module system and service platform for the Java programming language that implements a complete and dynamic component model. The OSGi framework installs units of resources called bundles which are application modules that together make up an application. Applications or bundles can be remotely installed started stopped updated and uninstalled without requiring a reboot management of Java packages classes is specified in great detail. Application life cycle management start stop install etc. is done via application programming interfaces APIs that allow for remote downloading of management policies. The service registry allows bundles to detect the addition of new services or the removal of services and adapt accordingly.

Bundles can export services or run processes and have their dependencies managed such that a bundle can be expected to have its requirements managed by the container runtime environment . Each bundle can also have its own internal classpath so that it can serve as an independent unit should that be desirable. All of this is standard such that any valid OSGi bundle can theoretical be installed in any valid OSGi container.

With the advent of cloud computing more and more companies are moving their traditional application runtime based applications such as applications in the OSGi framework to cloud environments to reap the benefits of cloud computing. For handling unexpected load during peak periods many customers exploit hybrid cloud approaches where the application may run in a private cloud inside a customer s firewall and additional capacity is sourced from a public cloud. The application is available in both the private cloud and the public cloud. However moving these traditional applications to a cloud environment raises some unique challenges with respect to security and regulatory compliance.

The most prevalent options for taking care of these security aspects related to application runtime environments when they are migrated to a cloud environment is to provide a greater degree of isolation for the virtual machine VM that is supposed to execute these applications referred to as VM hardening and to enforce stringent security policies for such VMs and hosts running these security sensitive applications. These approaches have several disadvantages. Increasing isolation between VMs increases complexity of migration of VMs as per cloud policies and dynamic resource requirements thus reducing flexibility. Providing isolation at VM levels reduces multi tenancy at a higher level of the stack i.e. at database level application level etc. reducing the efficient utilization of resources for sharing. These approaches also require additional provisions in terms of setting extra policies more logging use of specialized tools for security etc. at the cloud provider s end to handle such applications which increases cost of hosting such applications the cloud.

As described above management layer provides functions of resource provisioning service level management security and so forth. Thus management layer may provision resources to a virtual machine and an application runtime executing within the virtual machine. Management layer may also migrate a virtual machine to another host from a dedicated host to a private cloud from a private cloud to a public cloud from a public cloud to a private cloud from a private cloud to a dedicated host or other combinations of the above. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the application runtime is made aware of the fact it is running in a virtualized cloud environment so that the application runtime can dynamically change its behavior.

VM runs application runtime which loads application made up of application modules . In accordance with the illustrative embodiment application runtime gets a notification of its execution environment from VM or VMM . The notification may identify that application runtime is executing on a physical system is executing in a virtual environment or is migration happened or is happening. The notification may identify whether the virtual environment is a private or public cloud. The notification may identify whether the application environment is being migrated from a physical system to a virtual environment or vice versa from a private cloud to a public cloud or vice versa etc.

Based on the notification application runtime may check attributes of application modules . The attributes may be specified as metadata of the modules or the service registration attributes of the associated service by the provider module. Application runtime determines whether application modules are sensitive to execution environment or changes to execution environment. In the case of sensitive and secure data handling modules attributes may be specified and marked with alternate options such as the following execute only on physical environment execute on physical and secure private virtual environment or no attribute specified or execute any insensitive to execution environment .

For modules that are sensitive to execution environment the application runtime may make decisions regarding the behavior of application . Application runtime may request execution environment to provide enhanced security or defer the migration. Application runtime may seek out secure and environment specific alternate implementation of sensitive functionality. The application runtime may contact trusted module registry to provision alternate modules that satisfy the security needs of the application and are suitable for the execution environment. The application runtime may temporarily disable sensitive bundles functionality . If both of the above options fail application runtime may temporarily deactivate the sensitive bundle and hence the associated functionality until the next notification or event for favorable or compatible execution environment availability or availability of alternate implementation of sensitive modules.

In one embodiment application engine may perform combinations of the above according to user preferences in preferences data structure . That is preferences data structure may comprise preferences for security and regulatory compliance with respect to provisioning and or migrating application . Preferences may specify whether application must complete functions or services before being migrated. Preferences may specify whether application runtime may disable particular functions or services or whether application runtime must disable particular functions or services when provisioning to or migrating to a virtual environment. Preferences may also specify whether application runtime is permitted to provision alternate modules in application responsive to provisioning to or migrating to a virtual environment. Preferences may also specify whether application is to revert back to the original configuration when migrating back to a physical system or private cloud environment.

As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system method or computer program product. Accordingly aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment including firmware resident software micro code etc. or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a circuit module or system. Furthermore aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in any one or more computer readable medium s having computer usable program code embodied thereon.

Any combination of one or more computer readable medium s may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A computer readable storage medium may be for example but not limited to an electronic magnetic optical electromagnetic infrared or semiconductor system apparatus device or any suitable combination of the foregoing. More specific examples a non exhaustive list of the computer readable storage medium would include the following an electrical connection having one or more wires a portable computer diskette a hard disk a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM or Flash memory an optical fiber a portable compact disc read only memory CDROM an optical storage device a magnetic storage device or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system apparatus or device.

A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein for example in a baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms including but not limited to electro magnetic optical or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate propagate or transport a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system apparatus or device.

Computer code embodied on a computer readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium including but not limited to wireless wireline optical fiber cable radio frequency RF etc. or any suitable combination thereof.

Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages including an object oriented programming language such as Java Smalltalk C or the like and conventional procedural programming languages such as the C programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user s computer partly on the user s computer as a stand alone software package partly on the user s computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario the remote computer may be connected to the user s computer through any type of network including a local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN or the connection may be made to an external computer for example through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider .

Aspects of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and or block diagrams of methods apparatus systems and computer program products according to the illustrative embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and or block diagrams and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and or block diagrams can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer special purpose computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine such that the instructions which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus create means for implementing the functions acts specified in the flowchart and or block diagram block or blocks.

These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable medium that can direct a computer other programmable data processing apparatus or other devices to function in a particular manner such that the instructions stored in the computer readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions that implement the function act specified in the flowchart and or block diagram block or blocks.

The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer other programmable data processing apparatus or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions acts specified in the flowchart and or block diagram block or blocks.

The mechanism then determines whether the application runtime receives a notification indicating migration of the execution environment and determines whether the execution environment to which the application runtime is being migrated is less secure than more secure than or the same as the current execution environment block . The execution environment may be more secure if the application runtime is being migrated from a public cloud to a private cloud from a private cloud to a dedicated physical system or from a public cloud to a dedicated physical system for example. The execution environment may be less secure if the application runtime is being migrated from a dedicated physical system to a private cloud from a private cloud to a public cloud or from a dedicated physical system to a public cloud for example. The execution environment may be the same if the application runtime is being migrated from a physical system to another physical system or from one public cloud to another public cloud for example.

If the mechanism receives a notification and determines the execution environment to which the application runtime is being migrated is the same as the current execution environment in block then the application runtime does not modify the behavior of the application and operation returns to block to determine whether the application runtime receives a notification indicating migration of the execution environment.

If the mechanism receives a notification and determines the execution environment to which the application runtime is being migrated is more secure than the current environment the mechanism checks application module properties block . The mechanism determines whether at least one application module is secure i.e. sensitive to virtual environments block . If the mechanism determines no application modules are sensitive to virtual environments then operation returns to block to determine whether the application runtime receives a notification indicating migration of the execution environment.

If the mechanism determines at least one application module is sensitive to virtual environments in block then the mechanism determines whether to replace application modules with alternate environment specific modules block . The mechanism may determine to replace application modules based on preferences in a preferences data structure or based on whether such alternate modules are available. If the mechanism determines to replace one or more application modules the mechanism requests environment specific application modules from a trusted module registry block . The mechanism then provisions the alternate application modules block .

Thereafter or if the mechanism cannot or does not replace application modules in block the mechanism determines whether to enable functions or services in the application block . The mechanism may determine to re enable functions or services that were previously disabled based on preferences in a preferences data structure or based on whether the mechanism was able to replace application modules with environment specific modules. If the mechanism determines to re enable functions or services the mechanism re enables secure functions in the application modules block . Thereafter or if the mechanism determines to not disable functions or services in block operation returns to block to determine whether the application runtime receives a notification indicating migration of the execution environment.

If the mechanism receives a notification and determines the execution environment to which the application runtime is being migrated is less secure than the current environment in block then turning to the mechanism determines whether to request delay of migration block . If the mechanism determines to request delay of migration the mechanism requests delay in migration of the execution environment block . The mechanism completes critical processing block . Then the mechanism checks application module properties block .

Thereafter or if the mechanism does not request delay in migration in block the mechanism determines whether at least one application module is secure i.e. sensitive to virtual environments block . If the mechanism determines no application modules are sensitive to virtual environments then operation returns to block in to determine whether the application runtime receives a notification indicating migration of the execution environment.

If the mechanism determines at least one application module is sensitive to virtual environments in block then the mechanism determines whether to replace application modules with alternate environment specific modules block . The mechanism may determine to replace application modules based on preferences in a preferences data structure or based on whether such alternate modules are available. If the mechanism determines to replace one or more application modules the mechanism requests environment specific application modules from a trusted module registry block . The mechanism then provisions the alternate application modules block .

Thereafter or if the mechanism cannot or does not replace application modules in block the mechanism determines whether to disable functions or services in the application block . The mechanism may determine to disable functions or services based on preferences in a preferences data structure or based on whether the mechanism was able to replace application modules with environment specific modules. Lithe mechanism determines to disable functions or services the mechanism disables secure functions in the application modules block . Thereafter or if the mechanism determines to not disable functions or services in block operation returns to block in to determine whether the application runtime receives a notification indicating migration of the execution environment.

The flowchart and block diagrams in the figures illustrate the architecture functionality and operation of possible implementations of systems methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module segment or portion of code which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function s . It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and or flowchart illustration and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and or flowchart illustration can be implemented by special purpose hardware based systems that perform the specified functions or acts or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.

Thus the illustrative embodiments provide mechanisms for runtime based application security and regulatory compliance in a cloud computing environment. The virtual machine or virtual machine monitor exports platform properties to the application runtime. The virtual machine or virtual machine monitor may also perform dynamic notification of platform property changes to the application runtime. The application specifies security sensitivity as an attribute of application modules. The application runtime has the ability to disable or enable a subset of functionality request more services from the runtime or dynamically seek environment specific implementations in response to changes in the execution environment. The application runtime may enable or disable loading of application modules based on a combination of platform properties and module security attributes. The application module may also switch a specific module with an alternate version of the same module based on platform properties and module security attributes.

As noted above it should be appreciated that the illustrative embodiments may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In one example embodiment the mechanisms of the illustrative embodiments are implemented in software or program code which includes but is not limited to firmware resident software microcode etc.

A data processing system suitable for storing and or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code bulk storage and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.

Input output or I O devices including but not limited to keyboards displays pointing devices etc. can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I O controllers. Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks. Modems cable modems and Ethernet cards are just a few of the currently available types of network adapters.
