The present disclosure relates generally to tools for trip planning in view of weather conditions. More particularly the present disclosure relates to an interactive user interface providing weather information and available trips such as public transit trips.

Research has shown that weather is one of the most common reasons why people deviate from their typical commuting patterns or travel behavior. As an example when it is raining outside people tend to take alternative transit trips that reduce the amount of walking required even if such alternative trips increase the total travel time or fare. For example a person might choose to take an alternate subway route that involves additional transfers or takes more time but places her closer to her final destination so as to minimize the amount of time she is required to walk in the rain.

As another example when it is sunny and pleasant outside people tend to take alternative transit trips that increase the amount of time spent outside and reduce the amount of time spent travelling on an underground railway or a crowded bus. For example a person might choose to take an alternative trip that includes more walking or cycling.

As yet another example when severe weather conditions exist trips can be delayed or otherwise take longer than usual. Therefore in the event of such severe weather conditions a person may choose to take alternative transit trips with earlier departure times so as to compensate for the delays.

Certain existing systems allow users to receive information concerning available transit trips between an origin and a destination. However such existing systems do not provide weather information. Other existing systems allow users to receive information about current and or anticipated weather conditions for a given location. However such other existing systems do not provide information concerning available transit trips.

As such users are required to access two different sources of information in order to plan their trips in view of weather conditions. Accessing two different sources of information can be cumbersome and time consuming. For example the user can be required to load query and then switch back and forth between two different webpages in order to receive the desired information.

Further in instances in which the user desires to see weather and trips associated with several different time frames e.g. a morning commute a lunch meeting and an afternoon commute multiple interactions are required with each system and the user is continually required to manually confirm that they are appropriately matching weather information to transit trip information over a plurality of different times. This configuration can result in user confusion and frustration.

Aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description or may be obvious from the description or may be learned through practice of embodiments of the present disclosure.

One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computing system. The computing system includes one or more processors and one or more non transitory computer readable media storing instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the one or more processors to perform operations. The operations include obtaining data describing a plurality of trips between an origin and a destination. Each trip includes one or more legs. Each leg of each trip utilizes one of a plurality of different modes of transportation. The operations include obtaining data describing weather conditions associated with one or more of the plurality of trips. The operations include respectively representing the plurality of trips with a plurality of trip identifiers in a user interface. Each trip identifier comprises one or more portions respectively corresponding to the one or more legs of the trip such trip identifier represents. The operations include providing in the user interface an indication of the mode of transportation associated with each portion of each trip identifier. The operations include displaying the weather conditions associated with one or more of the plurality of trips in the user interface.

These and other features aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. The accompanying drawings which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification illustrate embodiments of the present disclosure and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the present disclosure.

Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the present disclosure one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the present disclosure not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. For instance features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus it is intended that the present disclosure covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.

Generally the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for providing an interactive user interface that displays anticipated weather conditions alongside a plurality of available trips between an origin and a destination. As an example a plurality of trip identifiers can be presented on a graph having an axis indicative of time. The plurality of trip identifiers can respectively represent the plurality of available trips and can provide an intuitive illustration of various aspects of the plurality of trips. For example each trip identifier can provide an intuitive sense regarding the overall duration of the trip a number of transfers or legs for each trip time spent in each leg of the trip a mode of transportation associated with each leg of each trip and or other information. The anticipated weather conditions associated with the trips can be presented alongside the plurality of trip identifiers. As an example a plurality of weather icons can be periodically spaced along the time axis of the graph to indicate the various weather conditions expected for the interval of time depicted by the graph. In such fashion a user can easily compare the various aspects of the available trips e.g. durations of various legs of trips having different modes of transportation in the context of the anticipated weather conditions so as to select a trip that provides preferred modes of transportation in view of the particular weather conditions for the time of travel.

More particularly a user can query a mapping application or a geographic information system to request information regarding available trips between an origin and a destination. For example the user can specify the origin and destination along with a departure time and or an arrival time.

In response to the user request the mapping application can identify a plurality of available trips. For example the available trips can be transit trips e.g. a combination of one or more publically available modes of transportation such as walking subways buses railways etc. driving trips taxi trips cycling trips or other modes of transportation.

In some embodiments of the present disclosure the available trips can scored and or filtered based at least in part on their associated weather conditions. For example if it is raining then trips that include significant amounts of walking can be penalized or otherwise filtered. As another example if the weather is sunny and pleasant then walking or cycling trips can receive a higher score or be presented first or in a more prominent fashion.

Once the appropriate available trips have been identified the trips can be presented in the user interface. As an example according to an aspect of the present disclosure the plurality of trips can be respectively represented by a plurality of trip identifiers provided in a calendar overview portion of the user interface. The calendar overview can include a graph that has units of time on a first axis. In particular the plurality of trip identifiers can be respectively provided at a plurality of positions of a second axis of the graph. Each trip identifier can extend from a departure time to an arrival time of the trip such trip identifier represents.

Further each of the plurality of trips can include one or more legs. For example a transit trip can include a plurality of legs that respectively correspond to discrete instances of transportation using one of a plurality of transit lines or modes of transportation. As another example a leg of a trip can correspond to required walking from one location to another. Therefore each trip identifier can include one or more portions that respectively correspond to the one or more legs of the trip such trip identifier represents.

According to another aspect of the present disclosure each portion of each trip identifier can provide an indication of the mode of transportation used by the leg to which such portion corresponds. In addition in some implementations each portion of each trip identifier can have a length that is proportional to the duration of the leg to which such portion corresponds.

According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure the user interface can further provide an indication of the anticipated weather conditions associated with the provided plurality of trips. For example in the instance that the user interface includes a graph of the trip identifiers the weather information can be presented alongside the time axis of the graph.

As an example a plurality of weather icons can be periodically spaced along the time axis of the graph. Each weather icon can provide an indication of the anticipated weather conditions for the time at which such icon is located. As another example a temperature curve can be provided along the time axis of the graph. The temperature curve can provide a graphical indication of the temperature conditions associated with each corresponding time along the time axis.

As another example particular weather conditions associated with one or more of the plurality of trips can be provided in a trip summary or a map portion of the user interface. For example in some embodiments of the present disclosure a user can select one of the plurality of trip identifies to receive additional specific information about the selected trip such as for example a trip summary. The weather conditions associated with the selected trip can be listed alongside the trip summary. Alternatively or additionally a graphical representation of the weather conditions associated with the selected trip can be superimposed upon a map of the trip. The graphical representation can be a precipitation forecast a temperature forecast or other forms of weather information.

As yet another example in some embodiments of the present disclosure the user interface can include a weather control that allows the user to select a particular time and receive information concerning anticipated weather conditions for the particular time. For example the weather control can include a scroll bar that allows the user to scroll through time. Alternatively or additionally the weather control can include one or more buttons that allow the user to select a day of the week.

Furthermore various aspects of the user interface can be interactive or otherwise controllable by a user. As an example the interval of time depicted by the calendar overview can be adjusted by the user. For example the user can scroll the calendar overview graph with respect to the axis having units of time. Alternatively the user can specify a particular desired arrival or departure time and graph can be adjusted based upon such desired time.

When the interval of time is adjusted by the user one or more additional trip identifiers can be provided that represent trips available during the adjusted time interval shown by the calendar overview. Furthermore the user interface can be updated to reflect anticipated weather conditions associated with the adjusted time interval.

Thus weather information and transit trips available over an extended period of time can be presented to the user in an interactive user interface. In particular anticipated weather conditions can be displayed in association with trip identifiers that provide an intuitive sense of trip duration number and duration of legs arrival and departure times and or modes of transportation used. Therefore the user can easily explore various aspects of the available trips in the context of the anticipated weather conditions so as to select a trip that provides preferred modes of transportation in view of the particular weather conditions for the time of travel.

With reference now to the FIGS. example embodiments of the present disclosure will now be discussed in detail. depicts an example user interface according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. User interface can be implemented by a computing system or device in order to present weather information in association with available trips between an origin and a destination.

User interface can include a calendar overview a trip summary portion and a map portion . Calendar overview can include a plurality of trip identifiers provided on a graph having units of time on an axis. For example calendar overview includes trip identifier .

Trip identifier represents a particular trip available from the origin to the destination. In particular such trip departs at 9 16 am from the origin and arrives at the destination at 9 43 am. Calendar overviews and trip identifiers will be discussed further with respect to .

In addition while the trips depicted in user interface are transit trips that include instances of transportation using one or more public transit lines the present disclosure is not limited to such trips. In particular as will be discussed further any suitable trip between an origin and a destination can be provided to the user using user interface including driving trips walking trips bicycling trips trips that includes flights or any suitable modes of transportation or combinations thereof.

Trip summary portion can include a trip summary that provides additional information concerning one of the available trips. Map portion can depict one or more of the available trips on a map . For example a trip is depicted on map .

Map can be generated from a variety of data types including imagery tables vector data e.g. vector representations of roads parcels buildings etc. and other data.

A scale or zoom level of map can automatically be adjusted based upon one or more trip geometries respectively associated with one or more trips depicted on map . For example the scale of map or portion of map provided in map portion can automatically be adjusted to display the entirety of the path followed by any depicted trip including the location of the origin and location of the destination.

According to an aspect of the present disclosure user interface can further provide weather information associated with the plurality of depicted trips. For example as shown in weather information is included in the calendar overview .

In some implementations weather information can include a plurality of weather icons e.g. weather icon periodically spaced along a time axis of the calendar overview . For example as shown in weather information includes a weather icon for each fifteen minute time interval shown by calendar overview .

Each weather icon can provide an indication of the anticipated weather conditions at the corresponding time designated by its respective location. For example as indicated by weather icon the anticipated weather conditions for the region of travel from about 9 45 AM to about 10 00 AM are fourteen degrees Celsius with a chance of rain.

Although the weather icons provided by weather information are spaced at fifteen minute intervals any interval can be used e.g. 5 minutes 30 minutes etc. . Furthermore in some implementations separate weather information can be provided for each trip.

In addition although not depicted in in some embodiments of the present disclosure user interface can provide a control that allows the user to select a particular preferred source of weather information e.g. one or more third party weather prognostication services . As another example in some embodiments user interface can allow the user to modify or personalize the formatting of weather information .

User interface can further include an origin destination control and a desired arrival departure time control . Controls and can be text entry fields dialog boxes toggles providing a plurality of predefined selectable options or any other suitable item that provides user control functionality.

For example origin destination control can be two text entry fields in which a user can input a desired origin and destination. As shown the user has requested available trips between origin Google New York 76 Ninth Ave New York N.Y. 10011 and destination Manhattan New York N.Y. Any suitable origin and destination can be entered by a user of the system.

As an example desired arrival departure control can include an arrival departure toggle a text entry field and a calendar based date selection module. As shown the user has indicated that she desires to depart the origin at 9 10 am on Tuesday May 7.

Using the information provided in origin destination control and desired arrival departure time control a mapping system can return a plurality of available trips that satisfy the entered information. One or more of the returned plurality of trips can be represented by one or more trip identifiers provided in calendar overview .

A plurality of trip identifiers can be provided in calendar overview including for example trip identifiers and . Each trip identifier can represent an available trip between the origin and the destination. For example trip identifier represents a trip that departs the origin at 9 10 am arrives at the destination at 9 37 am and makes use of two walking paths and the C subway line.

The plurality of trip identifiers provided in calendar overview can be ordered according to departure time such that the trip identifier representing the trip having the earliest departure time is provided at the highest position as shown in . Alternatively the plurality of trip identifiers can be ordered based on other parameters or can be maintained and presented in an ordering that was provided by the mapping service or other trip identification functionality.

Each of trip identifiers and can include one or more portions which respectively correspond to one or more legs included in the trips trip identifiers and respectively represent. For example trip identifier can include portions and . Each of portions can correspond to a leg of the trip represented by trip identifier .

As an example portion of trip identifier can correspond to walking from the origin to 14St. from 9 16 am to 9 20 am. Portion can correspond to taking subway line A from 14St. to 59St. Columbus Circle from 9 20 am to 9 30 am. Portion can correspond to waiting at 59St. Columbus Circle from 9 30 am to 9 31 am. Portion can correspond to taking subway line B from 59St. Columbus Circle to 96St. from 9 31 am to 9 37 am. Portion can correspond to walking from 96St. to the destination from 9 37 am to 9 43 am.

It will be appreciated that in some implementations waiting at a station is not considered an individual leg of a trip. Instead such period of waiting can be incorporated into another leg of the trip or simply be treated as a period of time between legs of the trip.

Each of portions can have a length that is generally proportional to the duration of its corresponding leg. In particular in the instance in which axis provides uniformly spaced units of time as shown in portions can be directly proportional to the duration of their corresponding legs.

Furthermore each of portions can indicate a mode of transportation utilized by its corresponding leg. For example portion corresponds to travel using subway line A . Thus an icon can be provided with portion which indicates that subway is the mode of transportation. Icon can further indicate the identity of the transit line being employed A . As another example portion corresponds to travel across a walking path. Therefore an icon can be provided in or along with portion which indicates that walking is the mode of transportation.

Icons and can be stylized or shown according to any suitable size or appearance. In one implementation icon is designed to resemble the particular symbols used by the transit provider or transit authority such that a user of a system implementing the present disclosure can more easily correlate portion with access to and use of subway line A .

In other implementations the mode of transportation associated with each of portions can be indicated using a color a line weight a line pattern or other graphical depictions or indications concerning different modes of transportation.

In addition any other suitable information can be presented in or along with trip identifiers and . For example trip identifier further indicates a trip departure time a trip arrival time and a trip duration .

Furthermore each of portions can be depicted using unique and or identifiable styles so that additional information can be communicated to the user. For example as shown in portions and are depicted using a dotted line to represent use of a walking path while portions and are presented using an unbroken line. Further one or more colors patterns or other stylistic choices can be used to differentiate portions of a trip identifier.

Calendar overview can include further features such as for example a current time indicator and a desired departure time indicator . Current time indicator can be any suitable form of indicator that indicates the current time. For example as shown in current time indicator can be a bar that is perpendicular to axis . The position of current time indicator with respect to axis can be continuously or periodically updated such that it generally reflects the current time of the day.

Desired departure time indicator can indicate the departure time that was entered by the user when the plurality of trips were requested. For example as shown in desired departure time indicator can be a bar that is perpendicular to axis .

Axis can be automatically scaled by a system implementing calendar overview . For example the scale of axis can be automatically adjusted based on the duration of the trips that are to be represented in the calendar overview. Thus the most useful information can be displayed across the relevant period of time whether the displayed trips have a relatively long duration or a relatively short duration 

Further in some implementations gaps or breaks in time can be included in axis . A visual indicator can be provided to alert the user that a period of time has been omitted from the graph. As an example if no trips are available from the origin to the destination between the hours of 2 am and 7 am then such interval of time can be omitted from the graph and an indicator can be provided. As another example if all trips displayed have an overlapping period of time in which no change in status occurs e.g. no useful information to convey then such overlapping period can be omitted from the graph and an indicator can be provided.

According to another aspect of the present disclosure the interval of time depicted by calendar overview can be adjusted by a user. For example as shown in calendar overview provides trips with departure times and arrival times included in the depicted interval of time about 9 04 AM to 9 56 AM. However a user can adjust or otherwise interact with calendar overview such that a different interval of time is depicted or provided by calendar overview .

Importantly when the interval of time provided by calendar overview is adjusted additional trip identifiers are provided that represent additional trips available during the new interval of time provided by the adjusted calendar overview . In such fashion the best trips available over an extended period of time can be explored using calendar overview .

In addition in the instance in which weather information is provided in association with calendar overview such as for example along axis then such weather information can be updated as well when the interval of time is adjusted by a user. In particular the weather information can be continually updated to provide anticipated weather conditions associated with whatever interval of time is depicted by calendar overview .

As an example a user can select a left paddle to adjust the interval of time provided by calendar overview to an earlier time. For example by clicking on or pressing on left paddle calendar overview can be adjusted by a predefined amount such as for example thirty minutes. Similarly a user can select a right paddle to adjust the interval of time provided by calendar overview to a later time. For example after clicking or pressing right paddle the interval of time provided by calendar overview can be shifted thirty minutes forward e.g. from 9 04 am 9 56 am to 9 34 am 10 26 am.

Other controls can be provided to interact with calendar overview as well. As an example a user can click or press hold and drag axis left or right in order to adjust the interval of time provided by calendar overview . For example selecting holding and dragging axis to the right can cause graph to be negatively scrolled with respect to axis e.g. move the depicted interval of time to the right such that an earlier interval of time is provided . Likewise selecting holding and dragging axis to the left can cause graph to be positively scrolled with respect to axis move the depicted interval of time to the left such that a later interval of time is provided . As another example graph can be scrolled by hovering a cursor over graph area and operating a scroll wheel.

As yet another example in one implementation clicking holding and dragging graph area to the right or left can adjust the interval of time shown. In another implementation which employs a touch sensitive display pressing holding and dragging graph area to the right or left with two touch items e.g. fingers can allow a user to adjust the interval of time shown.

It will be appreciated that the control methods provided herein are example in nature. Thus alternative control methods can be used in satisfaction of the present disclosure including controls which incorporate a flicking motion pinching motions tapping double tapping two item rotation or other suitable controls. As an example in one implementation the scale of axis can be adjusted using pinching motions on graph area or by selecting holding and dragging axis itself.

According to an aspect of the present disclosure when the interval of time provided by calendar overview is adjusted by a user the trip identifiers provided in calendar overview can be moved correspondingly. For example when graph is positively scrolled with respect to axis e.g. scrolled so that later times are shown the trip identifiers can be moved upwards and to the left until they are respectively removed from the field of view. In such fashion the user is given an intuitive visual sense that she is moving on to a later time and that the shown trip identifiers are receding in accordance with the earlier time of their corresponding trips.

Similarly when graph is negatively scrolled with respect to axis e.g. scrolled so that earlier times are shown the trip identifiers can be moved downwards and to the right until they are respectively removed from the field of view. In such fashion the user is given an intuitive visual sense that she is moving back to an earlier time and that the shown trip identifiers are proceeding in accordance with the later time of their corresponding trip.

Likewise in the instance in which weather information is provided in association with calendar overview such as for example along axis then the weather information can be moved in a corresponding fashion when the interval of time provided by calendar overview is adjusted by a user.

For example when graph is positively scrolled with respect to axis e.g. scrolled so that later times are shown the weather information e.g. weather icons provided at periodic intervals along axis can be moved leftwards in a corresponding fashion until particular time specific information disappears from the calendar overview and is replaced with new information specific to the new interval of time.

Likewise when graph is negatively scrolled with respect to axis e.g. scrolled so that earlier times are shown the weather information can be moved rightwards in a corresponding fashion until particular time specific information disappears from the calendar overview and is replaced with new information specific to the new interval of time.

According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure each of the trip identifiers provided in calendar overview including trip identifiers and can be capable of being selected by a user. For example when a trip identifier is selected all other trip identifiers can be presented in a faded fashion.

When a trip identifier is selected by a user additional information concerning the trip represented by the selected trip identifier can be provided to the user. For example depicts an example user interface according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. User interface includes a calendar overview a trip summary portion and a map portion .

In addition user interface can provide weather information associated with the trips depicted in calendar portion . In particular weather information includes a temperature curve . Temperature curve can provide a graphical indication of the temperature conditions associated with the corresponding times indicated by the time axis of calendar portion . One or more weather icons can optionally be presented in association with temperature curve . As other examples weather information can include a precipitation curve that graphically indicates expected precipitation volume or percentage chance of precipitation versus time.

Responsive to the user selection of trip identifier trip summary portion can include a trip summary that provides additional information about each leg of the trip represented by trip identifier . For example trip summary can include descriptions which respectively correspond to portions . Each of descriptions can describe a corresponding leg of the selected trip by providing information including but not limited to a leg departure time a leg arrival time a leg origin a leg destination a leg duration a leg distance a leg mode of transportation or any other suitable information such as particular transit line vehicle or transit provider used or number of stops traversed.

Further in response to the user selection of trip identifier the trip represented by trip identifier can be depicted on map portion . In particular each of the legs of such trip can be individually depicted using a variety of colors patterns indicators icons shadings text and or other suitable identifiers. For example the depicted trip includes depicted legs depicted origin and depicted destination .

In addition one or more overlays can be provided on one or more of calendar overview trip summary or map portion . For example a traffic overlay can be provided. The traffic overlay can depict current traffic conditions using various colors or patterns. The traffic overlay can also describe any delays being experienced by one or more of the transit lines employed by the selected trip. For example if portion of trip identifier corresponds to use of subway line A and subway line A is experiencing delays then one or more of portion leg description and depicted leg can be shown depicted or provided with an alternate rendering such that a user can ascertain that subway line A is currently experiencing delays.

As another example according to an aspect of the present disclosure a graphical representation of the weather conditions associated with the selected trip can be overlayed upon map portion . The graphical representation can be a precipitation forecast a temperature forecast or other forms of weather information such as for example severe weather alerts. The graphical representation can include various colors shadings icons text or other elements to provide a graphical representation of the anticipated weather conditions.

As yet another example one or more notifications can be provided on one or more of calendar overview trip summary or map portion . For example if subway line A is experiencing delays then one or more of portion leg description and depicted leg can include or be accompanied by a notification. For example the notification can be an illustrated exclamation mark that provides additional text information when selected by the user or hovered over using a cursor.

Other example overlays include a transit service outage overlay road construction overlay road closure overlay an elevation overlay for bicycling routes or any other suitable overlay or user selectable combinations thereof.

Furthermore although a single trip identifier is shown as selected in and therefore only a single trip summary is provided and a single trip depicted in map portion the present disclosure is not limited to such functionality. In particular in one implementation two or more trip identifiers can be selected at the same time. As a result two or more trip summaries can be provided in trip summary portion and two or more trips can be depicted in map portion . In such fashion a user can compare two or more available trips in various formats.

Weather control can be interactive and can allow the user to select a particular time and receive information concerning anticipated weather conditions for the particular time. For example weather control can include one or more buttons that allow the user to select a day of the week. In addition weather control can include a scroll bar that allows the user to scroll through time.

Once the user has selected a particular time weather information such as for example weather icon can be provided. The provided weather information can describe anticipated weather conditions associated with the day and time combination selected by the user. Thus in some implementations the user can be provided with the ability to separately explore weather conditions and available trips for different times within the same user interface.

User interface can also include an origin destination control and a desired arrival departure time control . Controls and can be text entry fields dialog boxes toggles providing a plurality of predefined selectable options or any other suitable item that provides user control functionality.

In particular as shown in the user has entered a desired origin and destination into origin destination control and requested trips that arrive by 5 pm on Tuesday May 7using desired arrival departure control . As a result a plurality of trip identifiers are provided in calendar overview that represent available trips between the provided origin and destination that arrive generally at before or around the provided desired arrival time. Further a desired arrival time indicator is provided in calendar overview which indicates the desired arrival time with respect to the provided trip identifiers. For example desired arrival time indicator is shown in as a vertical bar at 5 00 pm.

Other controls provided by user interface include transportation class selection buttons and trip preference toggles . Example transportation classes include driving transit walking bicycling flying or other suitable transportation classes. The transit transportation class can include trips which use rail lines bus lines tram lines ferry lines trains or any other suitable form of transit transportation.

Transportation class selection buttons can allow a user to filter all available trips between the origin and the destination based on transportation class. Alternatively transportation class selection buttons can be used to request trips using a particular transportation class from the mapping service or trip identification functionality.

In some implementations if the user has not previously actively selected a transportation class via buttons then the initial transportation class of trips returned in response to a search query can be dependent upon or influenced by the particular weather conditions associated with the time and location of travel. For example if it is sunny and pleasant outside and the user has not specified a desired transportation class then the systems of the present disclosure may first provide the user with available walking or bicycling trips in response to their query. Likewise poor weather conditions may result in driving class or transit class trips being provided initially.

In some implementations only a single one of the transportation class selection buttons can be selected at a single time. Thus as shown in if the transit class button is selected then only trip identifiers that represent available transit trips will be provided in calendar overview . In other implementations two or more of the transportation class selection buttons can be selected at the same time such that trip identifiers that represent a mix of trips that use any of the selected transportation classes can be provided in calendar overview .

Trip preference toggles can be used by a user to provide additional information about trip preferences. For example a user can provide additional information about a preferred vehicle type by selecting from among the options Any transit mode Bus Subway Train Tram Light Rail or any other suitable vehicle type option including for example Taxi. As another example a user can provide additional information about preferred route types by selecting from among the options Best route Fewer transfers Less walking or any other suitable route type including for example Wheelchair accessible. 

The system includes a server such as a web server. Server can be implemented using one or more computing devices. When server is implemented using a plurality of computing devices such computing devices can be organized into a distributed computing system or a parallel computing system.

The server can have one or more processor s and a memory . The server can also include a network interface used to communicate with one or more remote computing devices e.g. client devices over a network .

The processor s can be any suitable processing device such as a microprocessor microcontroller integrated circuit or other suitable processing device. The memory can include any suitable computing system or media including but not limited to non transitory computer readable media RAM ROM hard drives flash drives or other memory devices. The memory can store information accessible by processor s including instructions that can be executed by processor s . The instructions can be any set of instructions that when executed by the processor s cause the processor s to provide desired functionality.

Server can further include a trip identification module a trip scoring module and a trip filtering module .

It will be appreciated that the term module refers to computer logic utilized to provide desired functionality. Thus a module can be implemented in hardware application specific circuits firmware and or software controlling a general purpose processor. In one embodiment the modules are program code files stored on the storage device loaded into memory and executed by a processor or can be provided from computer program products for example computer executable instructions that are stored in a tangible computer readable storage medium such as RAM hard disk or optical or magnetic media.

Server can implement trip identification module to identify one or more trips in response to a user query. For example trip identification module can be implemented to perform one or more search algorithms with respect to data describing available trips between an origin and a destination.

Server can implement trip scoring module to provide a score for each trip identified by trip identification module . For example trip scoring module can be implemented to determine and provide a score for a plurality of trips based on any number of parameters including user provided preferences or criteria.

In some embodiments of the present disclosure trip scoring module can be implemented to determine and provide a score for each of the plurality of trips based at least in part on the associated weather conditions. For example if it is raining then trips that include significant amounts of walking can be penalized or otherwise receive a lower score. As another example if the weather is sunny and pleasant then walking or cycling trips can receive a higher score

Thus in addition to providing the user with access to weather information the systems and methods of the present disclosure can also assist in automatically selecting or identifying trips providing preferred modes of transportation in view of the particular weather conditions for the time of travel.

Server can implement trip filtering module to filter or order identified trips. For example trip filtering module can be implemented to filter trips based on the respective scores determined by trip scoring module or based on other parameters. In some implementations trip filtering module can filter trips based at least in part on weather data and mode of transportation data associated with various trips.

Memory can also include data such as geographic data that can be retrieved manipulated created or stored by processor s . The data can be stored in one or more databases. The one or more databases can be connected to the server by a high bandwidth LAN or WAN or can also be connected to server through network . The one or more databases can be split up so that they are located in multiple locales.

The server can exchange data with one or more weather services . For example server can send a request to weather service s that specifies a given location and time. In response to the request weather service s can provide data describing anticipated current or historical weather conditions for the date time and location. For example server can access weather service s using an application programming interface.

In some implementations weather service can be internal to or included in server . In other implementations server can aggregate weather information from multiple third party weather services .

The server can also exchange data with one or more client devices over the network . Although two client devices are illustrated in any number of client devices can be connected to the server over the network . The client devices can be any suitable type of computing device such as a general purpose computer special purpose computer laptop desktop integrated circuit mobile device smartphone tablet wearable computing device or other suitable computing device.

Similar to server a client device can include a processor s and a memory . The memory can store information accessible by processor s including instructions that can be executed by processor s and data. As an example memory can store a browser module and an application module .

Browser module can provide instructions for implementing a browser. In particular the user of client device can exchange data with server by using the browser to visit a website accessible at a particular web address. The user interfaces of the present disclosure can be provided as an interface of the website.

Application module can provide instructions for running a specialized application on client device . In particular the specialized application can be used to exchange data with server over the network . Application module can include client device readable code for providing and operating the user interfaces of the present disclosure.

The client device can include various input output devices for providing and receiving information from a user such as for example a touch screen touch pad data entry keys speakers mouse and or a microphone suitable for voice recognition. For instance the client device can have a display for presenting information such as the user interface of the present disclosure.

The client device can also include a positioning system that can be used to identify the position of the client device . The positioning system can be optionally used by the user to monitor the user s position relative to a transit route. The positioning system can be any device or circuitry for monitoring the position of the client device . For example the positioning device can determine actual or relative position by using a satellite navigation positioning system e.g. a GPS system a Galileo positioning system the GLObal Navigation satellite system GLONASS the BeiDou Satellite Navigation and Positioning system an inertial navigation system a dead reckoning system based on IP address by using triangulation and or proximity to cellular towers or WiFi hotspots and or other suitable techniques for determining position.

In some embodiments in order to obtain the benefits of the techniques described herein the user may have to allow the use of information such as the user s current location or allow storage of preferences selected by the user. If the user does not allow use of such information then the user may not receive the benefits of the techniques described herein. Further in some embodiments in which the systems and method discussed herein utilize information about users or user devices the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect or utilize such information. In addition in various embodiments certain information or data can be treated in or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed.

The network can be any type of communications network such as a local area network e.g. intranet wide area network e.g. Internet or some combination thereof. The network can also include a direct connection between a client device and the server . In general communication between the server and a client device can be carried via network interface using any type of wired and or wireless connection using a variety of communication protocols e.g. TCP IP HTTP encodings or formats e.g. HTML XML and or protection schemes e.g. VPN secure HTTP SSL .
