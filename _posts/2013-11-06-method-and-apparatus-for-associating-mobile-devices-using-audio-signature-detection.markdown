The present disclosure relates generally to mobile devices and more particularly to voice and audio recognition and more particularly to social networks.

Demographic information is used in modern information systems for a variety of purposes ranging from targeted marketing or advertising civil and municipal planning funding planning and other uses. Today social media platforms enable people to form groups or communities based on common interests that by nature define demographics of the users participating in such social media groups or communities. Given the advent of so called big data and related computerized platforms demographic information may be of further usefulness and may lead to new applications and may also depend on how such information is obtained and collected.

The disclosed embodiments provide capabilities for identifying multiple mobile devices across time and locations which are linked by having received a common similar audio input. The various embodiments include methods of operations for monitoring mobile device audio inputs to identify audio signatures contained within mobile device audio data that match audio signatures stored in a database or that match an audio signature obtained from at least one of the mobile devices and that may be used to identify other mobile devices receiving the same or similar audio. Therefore demographics may be generated based on the common audio profiles of mobile devices. Various applications of the demographic information will occur to those of ordinary skill. In one example application mobile device users may connect using social media based on finding other mobile device users that are potentially in a given interest demographic based on similar audio signatures such as but not limited to media file audio signature or the audio signatures of other audio related events as defined herein. In other example applications content may be provided to mobile devices based on groupings where the content is related to the group or more particularly to the common audio signature detected in audio data received from the mobile devices.

In one embodiment a method of operation includes obtaining audio data from a plurality of mobile devices comparing the audio data to at least one stored audio signature and grouping mobile devices that have audio data containing the at least one stored audio signature. In some embodiments the method may further include sending an invitation message to the grouped mobile devices to enable each mobile device to associate itself to the group. In some embodiments the method may further include providing content to the grouped mobile devices the content related to the at least one stored audio signature.

In some embodiments the method may further include obtaining context information from each mobile device that has audio data containing the at least one stored audio signature and subdividing at least one group of mobile devices based on the context information. Obtaining context information may be accomplished in some embodiments by obtaining at least one of timestamp information from the audio data of each mobile device or location information from the mobile devices providing the audio data. The obtained location information is related to a location where the audio data was collected by the respective mobile device. In some embodiments the method may further include accessing a database to obtain the at least one audio signature.

In some embodiments the method may further include associating the at least one audio signature with an event creating a group for the event on a social media platform and sending the invitation message to the grouped mobile devices from the social media platform. Associating the at least one audio signature with an event may be accomplished in some embodiments by associating the at least one audio signature with at least one of a live event a recorded version of the live event a broadcast version of the live event or playback of an audio file. In some embodiments one or more groups may be subdivided based on the event. For example groups may be subdivided based on timestamp information from the audio data or location information from the mobile devices providing the audio data where the location information is related to a location where the audio data was collected.

In another embodiment a method of operation includes obtaining audio data from a plurality of mobile devices identifying an audio signature within the audio data of at least a first mobile device of the plurality of mobile devices comparing the audio data of at least a second mobile device of the plurality of mobile devices to the identified audio signature detecting the identified audio signature within the audio data of the second mobile device based on a match between the identified audio signature and at least a portion of the audio data of the second mobile device and grouping the first mobile device and the second mobile device based on both the first mobile device and the second mobile device having the identified audio signature within respective corresponding audio data.

In some embodiments the method may further include sending an invitation message to the first mobile device and the second mobile device where the invitation message is to enable the first mobile device and the second mobile device to communicate using a social media server. In some embodiments the method may further include providing content to the first mobile device and the second mobile device the content related to the identified audio signature.

The disclosed embodiments also provide a server that includes at least one processor and memory operatively coupled to the processor. The memory contains executable instructions for execution by the processor where upon executing the executable instructions the processor is operative to perform any of the methods of operation described herein as being related to the server.

Turning now to the drawings is a block diagram of a server that is operative to communicate with various mobile devices to obtain audio samples related to various events. In accordance with the embodiments the server is located within a network such as the Internet and is accessible by various types of mobile device by Internet connectivity . For example a group of mobile devices has Internet connectivity and are each capable of establishing a connection to the Internet and to the server to perform the methods of operation in accordance with various embodiments. The server may further be integrated with or operatively coupled to various databases such as event signature database media signature database and mobile device groups database . The server may access and communicate with the various databases using an appropriate database access protocol . However the database access protocol used to access the various databases may be different in some embodiments. The server may also access and communicate with various social media or content servers .

In accordance with the embodiments the server includes at least one processor and a nonvolatile non transitory memory that is operatively coupled to the at least one processor . The non volatile non transitory memory stores executable instructions executable code C for a grouping application . The processor is operative to access the memory and to execute the executable instructions C stored therein in order to implement the methods of operation of the grouping application .

In accordance with the embodiments each mobile device that may access the server includes an always operating audio detection system. The always operating audio detection system is operative to detect voice commands and to route those voice commands appropriately as control signals to either mobile device applications components or to the Internet in order to provide various mobile device features and functions. In accordance with the embodiments the always operating audio detection system also sends audio data to the server over the mobile device s Internet connectivity . In some embodiments mobile devices will establish an Internet connection with the server only as needed periodically in order to send the audio data. In other embodiments mobile devices will maintain an Internet connection to the server at all times even though the mobile devices may only send the audio data to the server periodically.

The grouping application obtains the audio data from the various mobile devices and examines the audio data for various audio signatures. This may be accomplished by either making comparisons of received audio samples with known audio signatures stored in the event signature database or media signature database or by comparing audio samples from various mobile devices to detect matching patterns of audio signatures. The mobile device groups database may be used by the grouping application to keep track of the various mobile devices that are actively sending audio data and to assign groups based on detected audio signatures. An audio signature may be an acoustic fingerprint that enables audio database searching and identification of audio samples contained in the audio data. Various techniques for creating such acoustic fingerprints as well as for database search and comparison with audio data are known to those of ordinary skill and such techniques are therefore not described in detail herein.

The mobile device groups database may be considered a demographics database. That is the mobile device groups formed and tracked in the database may be used to provide statistical insights into activities of mobile device users. For example the collected audio data might indicate the time of day mobile device users are near a radio or television set in a crowd or consuming some type of audible media content. In one specific example the audio data might indicate how many mobile device users were in hearing range of an audio advertisement. Many other applications of the disclosed embodiments will occur to those of ordinary skill in light of the present disclosure and the examples provided herein.

The event signature database contains audio signatures for various types of known events for which audio data has been previously collected. Acoustic fingerprints have thus been generated to facilitate searchable event signatures. For example the event signature database may contain audio signatures for events such as a football game crowd noise or other characteristic audio an outdoor music concert and indoor music concert public speaking event or various other such events for which audio signatures may be collected and stored. The media signature database may contain stored audio signatures associated with broadcasting some of the event signature database events over media such as television radio the Internet etc. One example may be a musical logo played during a football game etc. Additionally the media signature database will contain audio signatures for various media files such as but not limited to television shows movies concerts songs files such as compact disc albums MP3 files MP4 files or any other type of media file that may include an audio component.

Put another way the event signature database contains audio signatures that are somewhat generalized to a given environment while the media signature database contains audio signatures more directed to media content such as but not necessarily copyrighted audio content . Thus the grouping application may examine audio samples received in the audio data by comparing the audio samples with audio signatures stored in the event signature database or the media signature database .

In some embodiments the grouping application may also compare audio samples from various mobile devices and group mobile devices based on common audio signatures contained in the audio samples even if no matching database entry exists for the audio signatures. Additionally the grouping application may also build the event signature database or the media signature database in some embodiments by generating from received audio samples and storing audio signatures that occur commonly at geographic locations time periods or combinations of both. Geographic coordinate data and timestamps may be obtained by the server along with the audio data or may be obtained as requested by the server based on a context request. That is the grouping application may include audio signature generation code. However in some embodiments the audio signature generation may be performed by a separate application residing either on the server or on the individual mobile devices. Thus in some embodiments the mobile devices may send an audio signature created from audio data at a given time and location rather than sending the raw audio data to the server .

If the grouping application identifies one of the stored audio signatures within the audio data of any mobile device then the grouping application will create a database entry for that mobile device in the mobile device groups database . The grouping application may then perform an action that invites the user of the respective mobile device to join a group based on a grouping identified by the grouping application . For example the mobile devices shown in may be associated with the mobile device group based on each of the mobile device having obtained audio and provided the server with an audio sample that contained an audio signature related to Event 1. However in other embodiments the grouping will be for demographic purposes and will not include sending any invitation message or other notification to the mobile devices.

In accordance with the embodiments the audio signature related to Event 1 need not be obtained by a mobile device at the same time or place as other mobile devices in order to be associated with the mobile device group . For example user 1 and user 2 may have attended a live concert i.e. a live version of Event 1 while user 3 may have watched and listened to either a broadcast or a recording of the live concert on television the Internet or by radio. That is the user 3 mobile device may have sampled audio containing the Event 1 audio signature at a different time and different place from the actual time and place of the live concert. In accordance with the embodiments the grouping application would nevertheless associate the mobile device of user 3 as a potential member of the mobile device group related to Event 1. The grouping application may also send the mobile device of user 3 an invitation to join the mobile device group . In other words mobile devices are grouped based on having received audio containing a like audio signature regardless of where or when the audio was received by the mobile devices. Examples of messages and information flows between an example mobile device and the server are provided in .

Various audio sources may provide sound waves to the example mobile device . Example audio sources include but are not limited to a concert conference rally television broadcast radio broadcast Internet broadcast or media file playback via a media file player the Internet etc. Thus sound waves provided by the various audio sources may contain audio signatures related to an event concert television broadcast sporting event political rally television show seminar movie nightclub party religious service classroom bus ride wedding service etc. or audio signatures related to a media file.

In one example an audio signature corresponding to a sound logo or musical pattern may be stored on either the event signature database or the media signature database . For example an audio signature corresponding to a musical pattern or segment used in beginning a football game such as an introduction to an NFL broadcast may be stored. This introductory musical pattern may be received by mobile device on Sunday as well as by other mobile devices that may be located at various places all across the country. The mobile device will send audio data to the server via Internet connectivity which includes an audio sample having all or a part of the audio signature for the musical pattern. The grouping application may then compare the mobile device audio data with audio signatures contained in the event signature database and the media signature database . Upon detecting a matching audio signature the grouping application may request context information by context request . The mobile device may then provide the context information which may include location information such as GPS coordinates. In other embodiments a timestamp location stamp or both may be provided along with the audio data . That is in some embodiments the context information may be provided automatically without the need for the context request . However mobile device privacy settings may determine whether or not such context information is sent to the server in some embodiments where context information may be sent either automatically or in response to the context request .

Also after detecting a matching audio signature the grouping application may either check the mobile device groups database for existing groups related the audio signature or may create a new group. The mobile device will be added to grouping table that is used to keep track of detected audio signatures so that groups may be created and so that in some embodiments group invitations may be sent to appropriate mobile devices. Thus if a group exists or is created in the mobile device groups database an invitation message may be sent from the server to the mobile device in some embodiments so that the mobile device user may join the group.

The group may be a community related to one of the various social network servers or may be related to determination of some other demographic information. Thus in the example a community may exist on a social network server for NFL fans or for fans of the particular NFL football teams known to have been playing on the particular day on which the audio signature matches were detected. In this example the invitation message may thus be sent and may therefore include information about an NFL virtual social community based on the NFL related audio signature obtained by the mobile device .

Therefore in the various embodiments mobile devices include an always operating audio detection system to listen for audio signatures that match audio signatures stored in a database. When matching audio signatures are identified by the server the mobile device is added to a grouping table and may be placed into an existing group or a pending group i.e. waiting for a pre specified number of members etc. . In some embodiments for existing groups the mobile device may be sent an invitation message that the mobile device may display in a low power mode without waking the mobile device. In such embodiments the mobile device user may choose to join the group or community or to receive content based on the displayed invitation message. For example joining a given group or community enables the user to interact with other mobile device owners who are listening to or have some interest in the same broadcast media file etc. In other words the mobile device always operating audio detection system is used to identify users engaged in a common event or having a common interest by monitoring ambient audio and looking for audio signature matches across devices. Joining a group or community may require that the user has an account on one of the social media or content servers that hosts the group or community or that provides the related content.

In some embodiments mobile devices may sample and store such as in a memory cache audio for upload to the server at pre determined intervals. The server may access one or more social media servers of the social media or content servers to initially create groups using platforms such as but not limited to Google Twitter Facebook or other social connection such that mobile device users may opt in and share comments ratings images etc. with the group or virtual community . The context information may include location data which may be used by the server to create grouping associations for mobile devices with some predetermined proximity or that are physically present at an event or within a given geographic region such as a certain state city etc. The context information may thus be used to collect demographic information as it relates to geography. The server may only consider mobile devices to form a potential group based on a predetermined threshold for a required minimum number of users that are participating in the same event. Once the threshold is reached the server may proceed to send mobile devices an invitation message to join a related community or to access related content from a content server etc. The mobile device users may then opt to join the group or community or to access the related content. Thus the methods of operation of the various embodiments can connect people at different locations engaged in the same event or having the same interests taste in music sports etc. regardless of the time or location at which the user heard the audio signature related to the group. In other embodiments the methods of operation can enable content delivery based on related interests. Other applications of the embodiments may occur to those of ordinary skill in light of the disclosure and examples provided herein.

Example details of the grouping table stored in the mobile groups database is shown in . The server may use the grouping table to keep track of various mobile devices as it receives corresponding respective audio data from each mobile device. The example grouping table includes columns including mobile device ID audio signature ID context data and group match ID. The mobile device ID column provides identification for the user of the respective mobile device so that an invitation message may eventually be sent to that mobile device. However in some embodiments audio data may be collected without information that would specifically identify the user other than timestamps location information or both. That is for demographic information purposes the specific identity of the mobile device users may not be needed. However some unique identification number may be assigned to a mobile device in order to recognize the mobile device so as to prevent duplicate entry of data in the grouping table . Example row shows example information for user 1. An audio signature ID may be assigned for a specific audio signature detected by the grouping application within the user 1 mobile device audio data. If the audio signature based on the audio signature ID matches an audio signature for a given group the row will include the group match ID as shown. The example audio signature ID and group match ID are both shown as hexadecimal values for purposes of illustration but could be any type of computer storable value that may be used as an identifier. In some embodiments the grouping application of server may request context information from a given mobile device. This information will then be stored as context data in a context data field as shown which may include GPS coordinates date and timestamp corresponding to the audio signature as well as other information such as calendar entries from the mobile device. However in other embodiments some context information such as timestamp location information or both etc. may be included along with the audio data and therefore do not need to be specifically requested by the server .

Some mobile devices may have multiple row entries in the grouping table . For example user 1 has a second row entry for an identified audio signature that does not yet have a group match ID. This may occur for example if a threshold number of users have not been found having the matching audio signature ID or for other reasons such as in the case of user initiated groups. In some embodiments the user may define a group and then provide audio data related to an event for the defined group. For example the audio signature ID in row for user 1 may be such an audio signature. In this example if an audio signature does not already exist an audio signature may be generated either by an application residing on the mobile device or on the server . The group match ID may then be in a hold situation until at least another mobile device or some threshold number of mobile devices that have a matching audio signature are identified. The grouping table entries therefore continue to row for N number of user mobile devices. In some embodiments a mobile device row entry may be removed from the grouping table for various reasons such as after an invitation message is sent to that mobile device by the server .

A schematic block diagram showing example details of the mobile device is provided in . In accordance with the embodiments the mobile device includes an audio monitor . The audio monitor may be implemented as software or firmware or a combination of software and firmware executing on one or more processors and may also include or may be implemented independently using ASICs application specific integrated circuits DSPs digital signal processors hardwired circuitry logic circuitry or combinations thereof. That is the audio monitor may be implemented using an ASIC DSP executable instructions executing on a processor logic circuitry or combinations thereof.

In the example of the audio monitor is implemented as executable instructions C stored in memory and executed by processor . An internal connection bus provides operative coupling between the processor and the other various mobile device components. As used herein components may be operatively coupled when information can be sent between such two components even though there may be one or more intermediate or intervening components between or along the connection path. Therefore any of the various components connected to the internal connection bus may be understood herein to be operatively coupled to the processor or to each other where appropriate. Operative coupling may also exist between modules or components implemented as software or firmware executing on a processor and such software coupling may be implemented using libraries or application programming interfaces APIs or other software interfacing techniques as appropriate. Such libraries or APIs are shown illustrated as providing operative coupling between various software implemented modules or components in .

The memory is a non volatile non transitory memory and stores the executable instructions C corresponding to the audio monitor executable instructions C corresponding to a voice recognition engine executable instructions C corresponding to one or more wireless protocol stacks executable instructions C corresponding to one or more applications an Internet Protocol IP stack not shown a mobile device operating system not shown libraries not shown used to implement various APIs and audio data that may be stored from time to time prior to sending it to the server . The processor is operative to access the memory and execute the stored executable instructions C C C C stored in memory to perform the methods of operation disclosed herein as well as to perform other functions and operations such as running the mobile device operating system etc.

The mobile device includes one or more microphones such as a microphone array and a speaker that are operatively coupled to configuration and pre processing logic . The configuration and pre processing logic may include analog to digital converters ADCs digital to analog converters DACs echo cancellation high pass filters low pass filters band pass filters adjustable band filters noise reduction filtering automatic gain control AGC and other audio processing that may be applied to filter noise from audio received using the one or more microphones . The configuration and pre processing logic may be a single component as shown in or may be implemented partly in hardware and partly in software or firmware executed by processor . In some embodiments the configuration and pre processing logic may be implemented using several hardware components and may also utilize one or more software or firmware components in various combinations. The configuration and pre processing logic may be operative to control the one or more microphones to turn certain microphones on or off or to adjust filtering or gain for purposes of various applications.

The wireless transceiver may provide wireless communication capabilities for one or more wide area network communications systems such as but not limited to Wi Fi cellular 2G 3G or 4G wireless communications systems and also provides the Internet connectivity over the wireless interface to communicate with the server . In some embodiments a second wireless transceiver may also be present in the mobile device . The second wireless transceiver may be a peer to peer transceiver and may provide wireless connectivity capabilities such as but not limited to Bluetooth Wireless USB ZigBee or other technologies etc. In some embodiments the second wireless transceiver may also provide Internet connectivity . Some embodiments of the mobile device may also include near field communication NFC logic that is operative to communicate with external NFC devices to provide information or to read information into the mobile device .

Location detection logic may include global positioning system GPS hardware and is operative to provide location coordinate data such as but not limited to GPS coordinates to the processor and to various applications . The user interface UI may include a track ball mouse touch sensitive elements physical switches gyroscopic position sensors etc. Some of the UI sensors may be included in a group of sensors . In some embodiments the sensors may be operatively coupled to a sensor hub where the sensor hub is further operatively coupled to the internal connection bus . The sensor hub may be operative to provide monitoring and data conversion functions for data received by the various sensors and provide sensor data to the processor . For example some of the sensors may be used by the UI to receive user inputs. For example the sensors may include the gyroscopic position sensors or accelerometers that are used to determine the position of the mobile device to facilitate various forms of user input for various applications when a user moves the mobile device into various positions. In one example the display may be adjusted by sensing the position of the mobile device as being horizontal or vertical. The sensors may also include thermal sensors and other sensors that may be used by the processor or various applications to adjust parameters of the mobile device or for other purposes. The display may provide a touchscreen capability that is part of the UI and may also provide a graphical user interface GUI related to a mobile device operating system a GUI related to one or more mobile device applications or both. The display may therefore be considered part of the UI in that it may be operative to receive command and control signals directly by touch.

The audio monitor is operative to obtain audio samples from the configuration and pre processing logic and to from time to time send the audio samples to the server . The audio samples may be stored as audio data in memory until a pre determined time interval at which the audio data may be sent to the server . The audio monitor may operate at the application layer of an IP protocol stack not shown executed by the processor to facilitate IP communications. An API enables the audio monitor to communicate with one or more wireless protocol stacks to send audio data to and to receive request messages from the server over a wireless interface using either wireless transceiver or wireless transceiver . Other APIs such as API enable the voice recognition engine to send voice recognition information over networks using either wireless transceiver or wireless transceiver . One or more applications such as but not limited to web browsers email programs etc. may also wirelessly communicate with the Internet or other networks by way of API . APIs enable voice control and command of the various applications by the voice recognition engine and may also interface with the mobile device operating system not shown . In some embodiments the audio monitor may also provide information to or receive information from the voice recognition engine by an API . The audio monitor may operate even when the mobile device is placed in a low power mode such as a sleep state and may wake the mobile device depending on voice commands detected by the voice recognition engine . The audio monitor and the voice recognition engine may be integrated into a single component in some embodiments such that the API is not required. In some embodiments the audio monitor may include an audio signature generation tool that can generate an audio signature from one or more audio samples. The audio monitor may in this case send a generated audio signature to the server rather than the entire one or more audio samples. The server may then store the generated audio signature in a database and search for the audio signature in the audio data of other mobile devices. Examples of methods of operation of the audio monitor are described below with respect to flowcharts in through .

Any of the above described components of mobile device may be implemented as software or firmware or a combination of software and firmware executing on one or more processors or using ASICs DSPs hardwired circuitry logic circuitry FPGAs field programmable gate arrays or combinations thereof. Therefore the mobile device illustrated in is one example of a mobile device and is not to be construed as a limitation on the various other possible mobile device implementations that may be used in accordance with the various embodiments.

The various embodiments also include non volatile non transitory computer readable memory other than memory or memory that may contain executable instructions i.e. executable code for execution by at least one processor that when executed cause the at least one processor to operate in accordance with the functionality and methods of operation herein described. The computer readable memory may be any suitable non volatile non transitory memory such as but not limited to programmable chips such as EEPROMS flash ROM thumb drives compact discs CDs digital video disks DVDs etc. that may be used to load executable instructions or program code to other processing devices such as servers mobile devices or other devices such as those that may benefit from the features of the herein described embodiments. For example executable instructions C or executable instructions C may be stored on any of the above described forms of computer readable memory etc.

The diagram of provides one example of an invitation message that may be sent to mobile device by the server in accordance with an embodiment. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that various other forms of notification such as but not limited to text messages e mail messages or other types of notifications may be sent and that various other social media platforms content servers etc. may be used in accordance with the various embodiments. That is the examples provided by are not to be construed as any limitation to the particular type of invitation message or invitation mechanism that may be used to invite a user of a mobile device to a group in accordance with the various embodiments.

Per the example of the mobile device has received audio through its one or more microphones and has sampled the audio to obtain audio data. The mobile device in the example has also periodically sent the audio data to the server in order for the grouping application to look for matching audio signatures. An audio signature was detected by the grouping application that matched either a stored audio signature stored within the event signature database or the media signature database or that matched other mobile device audio signatures that were located at a given location at a given time. For example various mobile devices may have been carried by users attending the Google I O event. In that case the grouping application may have interacted with one or more social media or content servers that already had a group associated with the Google I O event. The grouping application may have detected audio signatures in audio data received from the audio monitor of various mobile devices that matched with an event signature for a conference based on for example a crowd noise audio signature contained in the various mobile device audio data that matched a conference crowd noise audio signature contained in the event signature database .

Based on detecting the crowd noise audio signature the grouping application may have requested and received context information which may include mobile device calendar appointments location information or both depending on individual mobile device privacy settings for the audio monitor . In some embodiments the grouping application may also receive location information from the mobile devices along with the audio data as well as timestamp information and may thus make the inference that mobile devices are present at the Google I O event. In other words the grouping application may assume or infer that since the mobile devices are at or near the location coordinates of the Google I O event and have sent the matching audio signatures such as crowd noise that have timestamps at or during the known time of the event such mobile devices are likely to be present at the Google I O event.

Thus an invitation message may be received by the mobile device and displayed. The example invitation message is a notification message and may include a group or community name . In other embodiments the invitation message may provide a link to content related to the event such as but not limited to agendas maps schedules coupons advertisements or other content etc. Initially in some embodiments only a grouping query may be shown which allows the user to select the grouping query to respond or to obtain further information. That is the user may see a query such as Attending Google I O The user may then make a selection with respect to the grouping query and may respond yes or no. If the user responds no then the grouping query will disappear from the mobile device display. However if the user answers yes then a further notification message may appear on the mobile device display. The grouping query may also expire after a certain period of time such as after the conference adjourns and may be automatically deleted or cleared from the mobile device at that time.

The invitation message may initially show only the group or community name and may be expandable by clicking on an expansion contraction arrow . Expanding the invitation message may reveal the group description and hash tags associated with the group and which may correspond to the social media platform associated with the invitation message . A join button may also be displayed to enable the user to join the group or community. If the user does not wish to join the group or community the user may close the invitation message for example by selecting the expansion contraction arrow again and may also clear the invitation message using methods of operation known by those of ordinary skill. The invitation message may also be automatically deleted in accordance with known methods of operation after a set period of time or due to the user s failure to act on the invitation etc.

Thus in accordance with the embodiments the server obtains audio data from various mobile devices and determines the likelihood that particular users are engaged in a particular event based on an audio signature. These events could occur at any time across many locations. As described above examples of events include but are not limited to live television broadcasts pre recorded television broadcasts movies speeches or listening to recorded media files of those events or other recordings such as movies music videos speeches etc. Various methods of operation may be employed to check which devices are hearing audio from the same event. For example in some embodiments mobile devices known to be located near an event such as a concert sports game speech rally etc. may all be employed to listen to audio in a low power mode at a synchronized time and then upload the audio data to the server for comparison with those from other mobile devices. If matching audio signatures are detected then the mobile devices providing matching audio may be included in a new event group or invited to a group. In other words the server may send a command message to the audio monitor in mobile device to command the audio monitor to begin to collect audio data at a certain time and for a certain period of time.

For example live television events across time zones may require that mobile devices all collect audio data at a specific time for a related time zone and upload the audio data to the server such that the grouping application may check for matching audio signatures. As was discussed above the audio data comparison may be made to a known audio signature that was generated from audio data recorded or sampled at the same time and provided to the server . For example the server may know that at a given broadcast time in a given time zone a television program contains audio with a given audio signature for a given number of seconds. Therefore mobile device audio data having an appropriate timestamp may be compared to the known audio signature in an attempt to find a match. Mobile devices having the matching audio signature in their respective audio data may then be sent invitation messages to groups related to interest in the given television program.

In other embodiments mobile devices may be employed to listen for given music audio signatures if it is determined by the server that a given mobile device is in a car or other vehicle based on location information or other context information showing that the mobile device is travelling at high speed. In this case mobile devices may receive a group invitation where users are found that are listening to the same song.

The server may use various criteria for determining when to form mobile device groups. For example in some embodiments the server may only define and form mobile device groups if matching samples are obtained from a certain threshold number of mobile devices. The mobile device groups of communities formed may utilize any form of social media such as but not limited to social communities social topic categories such as a Twitter hashtags etc. a chat room including video chat rooms such as but not limited to Google Hangouts or other social media platforms etc. The invitation messages sent by the server may be but are not limited to mobile device notifications email text messages social network invite message etc.

Also in some embodiments a user may initiate audio data collection based on the user setting up a social group or community on a social media platform of social media or content servers using a mobile device. In this case the user may be prompted with a confirmation message from the audio monitor asking the user to confirm beginning audio collection to find and invite other users attending a conference listening to a certain song or participating in any other number of possible events. Upon user confirmation the user s mobile device may then begin collecting audio data and sending it to the server so that the server may generate audio signatures or identify existing audio signatures and may search for other mobile device user s having the same interest based on matching audio signatures.

Example methods of operation of the audio monitor of mobile device and the grouping application on server are provided in through . is a flowchart of a method of operation of mobile device in accordance with an embodiment. The method of operation begins and in operation block mobile device begins to monitor audio by way of the audio monitor which may operate even when the mobile device is in a low power state such as sleep mode. In operation block the mobile device sends audio data containing audio samples to the server using either wireless transceiver or wireless transceiver . In operation block the mobile device receives an invitation message in the form of a notification based on the monitored audio and may display the notification on the display . The invitation message may enable the mobile device to join a social media community receive content etc. The method of operation then ends.

In decision block the server than evaluates the context information to determine whether there is a match of context information between mobile devices such as a location match timestamp match etc. . If not then the server may group mobile devices based only on the common event as shown in operation block and may proceed to send invitation messages to the mobile devices inviting the mobile devices to join the group as shown in operation block . The method of operation then ends as shown. Otherwise if a match of context information is found in decision block then the method of operation proceeds to operation block . In operation block the server groups mobile devices based on the common event and also the common context information. In operation block the server may adjust for context differences if needed. For example some mobile device context information may indicate that the user is actually participating in a live event such as a concert. However other mobile device context information may indicate that the user is only listening to a recording of the song that was played at the live concert. For example the song may be an MP3 file played on a stereo system within the user s home. In that case the grouping application may set up separate groups or may set up subgroups for people who only listen to a particular song rather than a group of people that attended the live concert. In other words the grouping application may use context information to create more than one group for mobile devices that received the same audio signature. The method of operation then proceeds to operation block where the server sends the invitation messages to the mobile devices. The method of operation then ends as shown.

However if the server determines that the group or community is not a mobile device initiated group in decision block then the method of operation proceeds to operation block . In operation block the server may obtain audio samples from mobile devices based on context information such as location data and time. The server in operation block may then compare obtained audio samples from various mobile devices to each other. Regardless of whether the group or community has been mobile device initiated in decision block the method of operation eventually proceeds to decision block where the server determines if the mobile device audio signatures match. If no audio signature matches are found then the method of operation returns to decision block and proceeds accordingly. However if a mobile device audio signature match is found in decision block then the method of operation proceeds to operation block .

Returning briefly to decision block where a known audio signature exists the method of operation proceeds to operation block where the server obtains audio samples from various mobile devices and compares those audio samples with the known audio signature contained in a database. If an audio signature is found that matches the database in decision block then the method of operation also proceeds to operation block . If no matching audio signature is found that matches the database in decision block then the method of operation proceeds to operation block and continues to obtain audio data from the various mobile devices.

In operation block the server will group mobile devices based on the defined social media group or community. In operation block the server may obtain mobile device contact information if it is available. This may be dependent upon privacy settings of the individual mobile devices. In operation block if appropriate the server may further group or subgroup mobile devices based on common context information. In operation block the server may further make adjustments based on context differences between the mobile devices if needed. These context difference adjustments were discussed above previously and may include among other things adjustments for time location different languages in which media may be broadcast at different locations or other considerations. In operation block the server sends invitation messages to the various mobile devices requesting the mobile device users to join the social media group or community and the method of operation ends as shown. Each of the operations described above with respect to should be understood to repeat for a number of mobile devices participating in the audio grouping search. In some embodiments mobile devices may opt in or opt out of such audio signature grouping activity using a user interface to the audio monitor which is accessible to the user. However in other embodiments the audio signature grouping may occur without any user interaction such as when used for collecting demographic information. In embodiments using invitation messages the only user interaction required may be accepting or rejecting invitation messages or other messages depending on the embodiment.

That is although the various embodiments have been described with respect to grouping mobile devices in the case of social media groups or communities other applications of the various embodiments will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art. In other words the ability to group mobile devices based on detected audio signatures may have various other useful applications other than grouping such mobile devices based on social media. One such application includes advertising functions wherein mobile devices receiving a common audio signature may be sent advertising messages related to interests that may coincide or correspond to the detected audio signatures. Other applications may include security system applications where detecting audio signatures on certain mobile devices may result in sending those mobile devices appropriate emergency messages instructing the user of the mobile device what to do in the particular emergency situation. Other applications will become apparent to those of ordinary skill and such other applications are contemplated by the present disclosure and remain in accordance with the disclosed subject matter and the various embodiments disclosed herein.

While various embodiments have been illustrated and described it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
