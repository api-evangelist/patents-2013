The present disclosure relates to the repair and or correction of dysfunctional heart valves and more particularly pertains to heart valve implants and systems and methods for delivery and implementation of the same.

A human heart has four chambers the left and right atrium and the left and right ventricles. The chambers of the heart alternately expand and contract to pump blood through the vessels of the body. The cycle of the heart includes the simultaneous contraction of the left and right atria passing blood from the atria to the left and right ventricles. The left and right ventricles then simultaneously contract forcing blood from the heart and through the vessels of the body. In addition to the four chambers the heart also includes a check valve at the upstream end of each chamber to ensure that blood flows in the correct direction through the body as the heart chambers expand and contract. These valves may become damaged or otherwise fail to function properly resulting in their inability to properly close when the downstream chamber contracts. Failure of the valves to properly close may allow blood to flow backward through the valve resulting in decreased blood flow and lower blood pressure.

Mitral regurgitation is a common variety of heart valve dysfunction or insufficiency. Mitral regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve separating the left coronary atrium and the left ventricle fails to properly close. As a result upon contraction of the left ventricle blood may leak or flow from the left ventricle back into the left atrium rather than being forced through the aorta. Any disorder that weakens or damages the mitral valve can prevent it from closing properly thereby causing leakage or regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation is considered to be chronic when the condition persists rather than occurring for only a short period of time.

Regardless of the cause mitral regurgitation may result in a decrease in blood flow through the body cardiac output . Correction of mitral regurgitation typically requires surgical intervention. Surgical valve repair or replacement is carried out as an open heart procedure. The repair or replacement surgery may last in the range of about three to five hours and is carried out with the patient under general anesthesia. The nature of the surgical procedure requires the patient to be placed on a heart lung machine. Because of the severity complexity danger associated with open heart surgical procedures corrective surgery for mitral regurgitation is typically not recommended until the patient s ejection fraction drops below 60 and or the left ventricle is larger than 45 mm at rest.

In some instances patients who are suffering from mitral regurgitation are also in need of an aortic valve replacement. Studies have shown for example that about 30 of patients who are in need of an aortic valve replacement also have moderate to sever mitral regurgitation. Typically these patients only receive an aortic valve replacement and the mitral regurgitation is not treated. One method of aortic valve replacement includes trans apical aortic valve. A trans apical aortic valve replacement may be delivered via a trans apical approach which utilizes a short incision e.g. 3 4 inch long between two ribs to gain access to the apex of the left ventricle. This is sometimes referred to as a mini thoracotomy and is much less invasive than the traditional method of getting access to the heart a median sternotomy which involves cracking the sternal bone in the middle and spreading the chest wide open.

Another common heart condition includes coronary artery disease which may be treated by coronary artery bypass graft CABG surgery via a mini thorcotomy. Sometimes such patients can also benefit from concomitant mitral repair. In fact sometimes the patient has mitral regurgitation because of the coronary blockage and CABG alone is not enough to treat the mitral regurgitation.

Accordingly there exists a need to treat mitral regurgitation particularly using a trans apical approach.

By way of an overview a perspective view of one embodiment of a trans apical mitral valve implant is illustrated within the heart is generally illustrated in . The trans apical mitral valve implant hereinafter referred to simply as the implant and or mitral valve implant includes a spacer a shaft and optionally an anchor assembly . In general the mitral valve implant is delivered within the heart and anchored to the native coronary tissue as generally illustrated in such that at least a portion of the spacer is disposed proximate a mitral valve and the mitral valve implant may interact and or cooperate with at least a portion of the native mitral valve to reduce and or eliminate excessive regurgitation. For example at least a portion of one or more cusps of the heart valve may interact with engage and or seal against at least a portion of the heart valve implant for example but not limited to the spacer when the mitral valve is in a closed condition. The interaction engagement and or sealing between at least a portion of at least one cusp and at least a portion of the heart valve implant may reduce and or eliminate regurgitation in a heart valve for example providing insufficient sealing including only a single cusp e.g. following removal of a diseased and or damaged cusp and or having a ruptured cordae. A heart valve implant consistent with the present disclosure may be used in connection with various additional and or alternative defects and or deficiencies.

As discussed in greater detail herein the mitral valve implant is delivered to the mitral valve within the left ventricle and or left atrium by way of a trans apical approach. A short incision e.g. 3 4 inch long between two ribs is formed to gain access to the apex of the left ventricle . An incision is made through the apex to gain access to the left ventricle . The mitral valve implant is then introduced into the mitral valve the spacer is expanded and the anchor is secured to the native coronary tissue of the heart for example on the outside of the heart proximate to the apex .

The mitral valve implant provides numerous benefits. For example the mitral valve implant may be installed to reduce prevent mitral regurgitation on a beating heart i.e. without removing the patient s heart and without cardiopulmonary bypass CPB surgery . The trans apical approach is therefore less invasive compared to a median sternotomy. Additionally as noted above many patients who suffer from mitral regurgitation also suffer from other conditions which necessitate trans apical surgery. As such the mitral valve implant according to the present invention allows for the treatment of mitral regurgitation without requiring significant invasive surgery e.g. the mitral valve implant may be implanted while the patient is already undergoing trans apical surgery to address other medical conditions .

With reference to the trans apical system and method includes gaining access to the left ventricle . For example a hollow needle which may be coupled to a needle hub is inserted through the apex of the left ventricle and into the left ventricle . Once access has been achieved to the left ventricle a guide wire is introduced through the lumen of the hollow needle into the left ventricle as generally illustrated in . The guide wire may include a 1 32 wire and may optionally form a curved pig tail like shape after the guide wire exits the lumen of the hollow needle in the left ventricle .

With the guide wire in the left ventricle the hollow needle is removed from heart leaving the guide wire remaining in the left ventricle as generally illustrated in . The guide wire may be used as a pathway for advancing other instruments and devices into the heart . For example an introducer and or dilator may be advanced along the guide wire into the left ventricle as generally illustrated in .

The distal end of the shaft of the introducer may be beveled to aid in passing the introducer through incision in the apex . The introducer may also feature a predefined bend . The predefined bend is formed in the introducer during the manufacturing of the introducer and is configured to facilitate alignment of the distal end of the introducer with the mitral valve . Without the bend e.g. if the introducer was just linear it would be very difficult to align the tip of the introducer with the mitral valve and between the two papillary muscles and into the outflow tract of the mitral valve . While the bend curvature does not appear to be perfectly aligned with the mitral valve this is due in part to the three dimensional path which is not readily shown in a two dimensional drawings. The bend may be disposed at an angle of approximately 20 40 degrees for example 30 degrees from the longitudinal axis of the main portion of the introducer extending outwardly from the incision in the apex .

The introducer may optionally include a splitter also referred to as the introducer hub configured to longitudinally split the shaft of the introducer such that the introducer forms a split catheter which can be easily removed while allowing an object within the lumen of the introducer e.g. the guidewire and or a portion of the implant to remain within the lumen of the introducer . The splitter may include a seal configured to allow another device and or lumen to be selectively and removably sealed and or advanced through the to the splitter into the lumen of the introducer .

For example the splitter introducer hub may include at least two parts namely an outer shell made of a polymer that has been molded in such a way as to provide a preferential and controlled break away seam and the inner seal made of silicone rubber also with a molded break away seam. The outer shell and silicone seal are mechanically connected so that the break away seams are both positioned along the same axis as the shaft lumen of the introducer . The splitter introducer hub is mechanically connected to the proximal end of the introducer s tubular shaft. When the handles of the outer shell of the splitter introducer hub are actuated in opposite directions with sufficient force rotating away from the axis of the introducer toward the distal end of the introducer the preferential break away seams of the outer shell and of the inner seal of the splitter introducer hub permanently separate and propagate a tear in the wall of the tube of the introducer . Continuing to further separate the handles of the splitter introducer hub in turn continues to advance the tear in the tube of the introducer . The user continues to separate the handles tearing the tube until the tear reached the distal end of the tube and completes the axial separation of the introducer .

Once the introducer has been advanced into the left ventricle through the incision in the apex one or more purse string sutures and or pledgets may be secured around the shaft of the introducer and the incision as generally illustrated in . The purse string sutures and or pledgets are configured to apply a radially compressive force against the shaft of the introducer during the procedures thereby minimizing the potential for accidentally tearing the heart tissue proximate to the incision and also minimizing blood loss during the procedure. For example one or more heavy gauge sutures may be passed around the shaft of the introducer in a continuous loop so that when it is all the way around the suture can be pulled tight like a noose or purse string to hold the surrounding tissue tightly around the introducer . To prevent the suture from tearing through the tissue each time the suture passes through tissue the suture also passes through a small pledget of woven polyester fabric. Optionally two purse strings each with four pledgets may be used to secure the introducer to the left ventricle wall.

One embodiment of a dilator may include define at least one lumen configured to receive at least a portion of the delivery guide wire . For example the lumen may have an internal diameter of approximately 0.038 . The dilator may also comprise a shaft including a tapered tip region . The tapered distal tip may be provided to facilitate advancing the tip into the puncture site in the apex as the dilator is introduced over the delivery guide wire . The shaft may comprise a plurality of segments or portions having different stiffness or hardness to produce the desired overall curvature. The shaft may be formed from one or more suitable polymers such as but not limited to a polyether block amide. The shaft may have a constant inner and or outer diameter and may be made from different materials to provide the various stiffness or hardness. Alternatively or in addition the shaft may have different inner and or outer diameters and may be made from one or more materials. For example the various stiffness or hardness of the shaft may be provided by varying the thickness of the shaft at the different segments or portions. The different hardness of the segments may provide differing degrees of bending stiffness to the dilator which may facilitate advancing the dilator into and or out of the left ventricle .

Once the introducer is positioned in the left ventricle the guidewire may be removed leaving the introducer and dilator in the left ventricle as generally illustrated in . Because of the predetermined bend the distal end of the introducer and or dilator is generally aligned with the mitral valve . A deflated messenger balloon may be advanced through the lumen of the introducer and or dilator until at least a portion of the deflated messenger balloon exits the distal end of the introducer and or dilator as generally illustrated in the dilator is shown retracted into the introducer for clarity . A shaft of the messenger balloon may include indicia for indicating the position of the messenger balloon relative to the introducer . For example when the indicia which may include the proximal end of a fabric covering the shaft is aligned with and or protrudes a few millimeters from the splitter about 1 cm of the messenger balloon is protruding from the end of the introducer .

The messenger balloon when expanded is configured to facilitate advancement of the introducer and or dilator through the mitral valve without damaging the mitral valve or becoming entangled in the mitral valve for example the cusps the chordae and or papillary muscles of the mitral valve . The messenger balloon may be disposed proximate the distal end region of a shaft and may be fluidly coupled through the shaft to an expansion medium such as but not limited to a gas and or liquid which may expand and or enlarge the messenger balloon from the deflated or retracted position as generally illustrated in to the inflated or expanded position as generally illustrated in note that the messenger balloon is only partially extending from the introducer . The messenger balloon forms a soft tip which serves as an atraumtic bumper tip to minimize the risk of damaging or even irritating the delicate lining endocardium of the left ventricle . To much contact with the left ventricle can cause a dangerous arrhythmia. According to at least one embodiment the expansion medium may include carbon dioxide CO2 gas and or saline. Optionally contrast media may be introduced into the messenger balloon to allow the messenger balloon to be more easily visually located using fluoroscopy or the like. The contrast media may coat the inside surface of the messenger balloon .

The messenger balloon may include a resiliently expandable collapsible material such as but not limited to silicone Yulex or the like which may be selectively collapsed and or expanded. The messenger balloon may be bonded to the shaft and may include one or more passageways apertures or lumens to allow the expansion medium to expand collapse the messenger balloon . The diameter of the messenger balloon should be small enough in the first or retracted collapsed position to be advanced over the delivery guide wire through the introducer and or dilator to the left ventricle and large enough when in the second or expanded inflated position to be advanced through the cusps and chordae of the mitral valve to reduce the potential of damaging the heart and or getting entangled within the mitral valve . For example the shaft may have an outer diameter of approximately 0.062 e.g. a 5 Fr . The messenger balloon may diameter of approximately 0.100 in the first position and a diameter of approximately 15 mm to approximately 20 mm cm in the second position with a length of approximately 8 to approximately 10 mm.

The messenger balloon is advanced towards the mitral valve as generally illustrated in . As can be seen the bend in the introducer helps to get the introducer correctly orientated spatially to find the space between the two papillary muscles and avoid the chordae. As noted above the limitations of the two dimensional figures do not completely convey the advantage of the bend . With the messenger balloon proximate to the mitral valve the messenger balloon may be advanced through the mitral valve . The backflow from the left ventricle through the mitral valve into the left atrium even for a normal mitral valve helps pull the inflated messenger balloon into the mitral space such that the messenger balloon may ultimately be advanced into the left atrium as generally illustrated in . The introducer and the dilator may then be advanced over the shaft of the messenger balloon into the left atrium .

Once the introducer has been advanced through the mitral valve into the left atrium the dilator guide wire and the messenger balloon may be removed from the introducer and the retracted deflated implant may be loaded into the introducer for example through the splitter as generally illustrated in . Prior to loading the implant into the introducer the implant may be de aired. If entrapped air from the implant is allowed to be introduced into the patient s cardiovascular system the air may travel to the patient s brain or other parts of the patient s body where it may cause serious bodily harm and or death for example due to blood clotting or the like . To de air the implant a fluid such as but not limited to a saline solution or the like may be injected through the inflation lumen into the spacer cavity to flush away and or remove any entrapped air before the implant is inserted into the introducer .

As note previously the implant includes an expandable spacer a shaft and an anchor assembly . When the implant is loaded into the introducer the shaft may have a length substantially longer than the length of the shaft when the implant is secured to the heart e.g. as shown in . For example the shaft may be long enough to allow the surgeon to manipulate the implant from outside of the patient s body while the implant is disposed within the left atrium mitral valve . The shaft may include generally flexible tubing such as but not limited to a poly tetrafluoroethylene PTFE tube defining an lumen. Optionally the exterior surface of the shaft may include a fabric sheath or the like configured to prevent blood clots from becoming dislodged off the shaft . The shaft may also optionally include one or more stiffeners not shown to provide the necessary amount of rigidity to the shaft such that the shaft is able to maintain the position of the spacer with respect to the mitral valve when installed. The stiffener may include for example braided mesh or the like.

According to one embodiment the shaft is secured to a handle assembly and the anchor assembly may disposed proximate to the handle assembly . The handle assembly may be used to advance the implant through the introducer until at least a portion of the implant e.g. the retracted deflated spacer protrudes beyond the distal end of the introducer in the left atrium as generally illustrated in . Once a portion of the spacer protrudes beyond the distal end of the introducer the introducer may be retracted slightly to allow the rest of the spacer to protrude beyond the distal end . The spacer may also be inflated using the handle assembly and pulled back from the left atrium and into the annulus of the mitral valve as generally illustrated in . The position of the spacer within the annulus of the mitral valve may be determined using one or more markers e.g. radio opaque markers which may be visible under fluoroscopy . The distal end of the introducer is now disposed in the left ventricle . Contrast medium can be injected into the introducer to the left ventricle to verify if the mitral regurgitation has been significantly reduced by the action of the spacer engaging with the cusps of the mitral valve .

Turning now to the spacer valve assembly of the implant is generally illustrated in a retracted position in which the spacer is ready to be expanded i.e. ready to receive an expansion medium and in an expanded position in which the spacer has been expanded and sealed. The spacer valve assembly allows the spacer to be selective expanded and or deflated to desired pressure or stiffness. The spacer includes a resilient flexible wall formed from a biologically acceptable material for example Elast Eon material or the like.

A first proximal end of the wall is coupled mounted or otherwise secured to a portion of the shaft . The spacer may include a first inflation lumen which may extend substantially along substantially the entire longitudinal axis of the spacer or only a portion thereof. The first inflation lumen is fluidly couple to a second inflation lumen associated with the shaft and is configured to allow an expansion medium such as but not limited to saline or the like into a spacer cavity from the handle assembly the handle assembly may be seen e.g. in . The first inflation lumen may be a component of the spacer and or may include an extension of the shaft e.g. the first and second inflation lumens may be parts of the same lumen .

The spacer cavity is defined by the first inflation lumen and the wall . The second distal end of the spacer includes an end plug configured to seal the distal end of the second portion of the first inflation lumen to the wall . The first inflation lumen also includes a plurality of apertures . The apertures may be disposed along the length of the first inflation lumen and are configured to allow the expansion medium to flow from the first inflation lumen into the spacer cavity . The first inflation lumen may include a first set of apertures e.g. apertures which are disposed proximate to the first end of the spacer and or a second set apertures e.g. apertures which are disposed proximate to the second end of the spacer . The use of two sets of apertures allows for more even inflation of the spacer cavity .

As noted herein the spacer valve assembly is configured to allow the surgeon to selectively expand retract the spacer and more specifically the spacer cavity . The spacer valve assembly may feature a plunger disposed within first and or second inflation lumens which is configured to selectively seal the first inflation lumen and or the apertures and selectively allow the expansion medium to flow into and or out of the spacer cavity .

With reference to various positions of the plunger within the first and or second inflation lumens are generally illustrated. In particular illustrates the plunger in the retracted position ready to be expanded corresponding to . illustrates the plunger in the expanded sealed position corresponding to . illustrates the plunger in an optional intermediate position in which the spacer cavity is selectively removably sealed such that the expansion of the spacer cavity within the mitral valve can be verified. The intermediate position allows the surgeon to selectively seal and unseal the plunger such that the surgeon can to be selectively expanded and or retracted the spacer cavity based on the performance of the implant within the mitral valve .

The plunger is coupled to a plunger wire . The plunger wire extends through the inflation lumens of the spacer and or the shaft and may be coupled to an inflation handle assembly as described herein. The plunger wire allows the surgeon to move the plunger within the first and or second inflation lumens into any of the inflation sealing positions. The plunger wire may be releasably coupled to the plunger wire for example using a threaded connection or the like.

With reference to the plunger is in the expansion position ready to be expanded and the apertures are fluidly coupled to the first and second inflation lumens . The plunger may be disposed within the first inflation lumen between the first set of apertures and the second set of apertures . Because the first set of apertures are upstream of the plunger the first set of apertures are fluidly coupled to the inflation lumen . The first inflation lumen may have a tapered internal diameter which expands along the longitudinal axis of the spacer from first or proximal end towards the second or distal end of the spacer . At least a portion of the cross section e.g. the diameter of the first inflation lumen is larger than the cross section e.g. diameter of the plunger such that fluid can flow past the plunger thereby fluidly coupling the second set of apertures to the inflation lumen .

Turning now to the plunger is in the retracted sealed position in which the apertures are fluidly sealed from the first and second inflation lumens . The plunger may be disposed within and sealed with the first or second inflation lumen upstream of first and second sets of apertures . As such no expansion medium can flow into or out of the apertures and the spacer cavity is sealed. For the sake of clarity the plunger will be described as sealing with the second inflation lumen however it should be appreciated that the plunger may seal with either the first and or the inflation lumens .

The plunger may have a tapered e.g. a generally cylindrical taper configured to create a frictional connection e.g. a Morse taper or the like with the corresponding taper e.g. a generally cylindrical taper of the second inflation lumen to seal the second inflation lumen and ultimately the spacer cavity . The plunger may also form a threaded connection with the second inflation lumen to seal the second inflation lumen and ultimately the spacer cavity . Alternative embodiments of sealing the plunger with the second inflation lumen are also possible.

It should be appreciates that the orientations of taper of the plunger and the taper of the inflation lumen may be switched. Switching the orientations of the tapers would result in urging the plunger in the opposite directions to seal and unseal the spacer cavity .

Turning now to one embodiment of an inflation handle assembly is generally illustrated. A proximal end of the shaft may be secured either permanently or releasably secured to a portion of the inflation handle assembly . For example the shaft may be hermetically sealed and coupled to inflation handle assembly using one or more seals . The body of the inflation handle assembly includes an inflation port which is fluidly coupled to the inflation lumen of the shaft . The inflation port is configured to be secured to an inflation source e.g. but not limited to a plunger syringe or the like not shown for providing the expansion medium to the spacer cavity as described herein.

The plunger wire extends from the inflation lumen of the shaft and passes through the body of the inflation handle assembly . One more seals may be provided to seal the body to the plunger wire as the plunger wire passes through the body . The proximal end of the plunger wire is optionally secured to a translator . The translator which may include a ring slide knob or the like may be configured to move with respect to the body to push or pull the plunger wire within the inflation lumens . For example when the translator is in the position illustrated in the plunger may be arranged in the inflation position as generally illustrated in . When the translator is in the position illustrated in the plunger may be arranged in the expanded sealed position as generally illustrated in . When the translator is in a position between the plunger may be arranged in the intermediate position as generally illustrated in .

The inflation handle assembly may optionally include one or more handle features extending from the body that are configured to facilitate handling of the inflation handle assembly with one hand. For example the inflation handle assembly may include two handle features disposed on generally opposite sides of the body each of which is configured to receive a different one of a user s fingers for example the pointer and middle fingers respectively . The translator may feature a ring configured to receive a user s thumb. With this arrangement the surgeon may grip the inflation handle assembly with a single hand and translate the translator back and forth to urge the plunger wire and ultimately the plunger back and forth to selectively seal and unseal the spacer cavity . This arrangement allows the surgeon to control the inflation medium source using the surgeon s other hand.

Turning now to the implant is illustrated with the spacer within the heart . The shaft of the implant is disposed within the introducer e.g. a split catheter and coupled to the inflation handle assembly . The anchor is also shown disposed proximate to the inflation handle assembly . The inflation port is fluidly coupled to an expansion medium source e.g. a plunger syringe . The surgeon may use the inflation handle assembly to manipulate the implant such that the spacer is disposed within the mitral valve . The spacer may also be expanded to the desired size using the inflation handle assembly and the expansion medium source . The spacer may be sealed using the inflation handle assembly once the desired size of the spacer is determined.

After the operation of the spacer has been verified and the spacer has been sealed the introducer may be removed from the shaft for example as generally illustrated in . For example the splitter may be used to split the introducer into two or more pieces along its length for example by pulling the two halves generally in the directions of arrows . As the introducer is split the introducer may be retracted from heart through the incision in the apex . The purse string sutures not shown for clarity may also be tightened as the introducer is removed from the incision in the apex to minimize blood loss. Once the introducer has been removed from the shaft the anchor assembly may be advanced along the shaft until the anchor assembly is adjacent to and or abuts against the apex of the heart for example as generally illustrated in . Additionally the plunger wire may be disconnected from the plunger for example by rotating the translator to unthread the plunger wire from the plunger .

Turning now to various views of one embodiment of an anchor assembly are generally illustrated. The anchor assembly as best seen in which is a cross sectional view taken along line B B of includes a clamp ring a collar a nut an anchor support and optionally a felt pad . The anchor assembly defines a passageway extending therethrough which is configured to receive and be advanced over the shaft of the implant . The clamp ring collar and nut are configured to define a compression fitting around a perimeter of the shaft thereby securing the anchor assembly to the shaft . In particular once the anchor assembly is in place e.g. abutting against the tissue surround the incision site proximate to the apex the surgeon holds the anchor support while rotating the nut thereby compressing the clamp ring and the collar to apply a radially compressive force against the shaft . The radially compressive force secures the anchor assembly to the shaft . For illustrative purposes the anchor support may have a length L of 0.875 cm and thickness T of 0.030 cm and the passageway may have a diameter D of 0.116 cm.

To secure the anchor assembly to the heart the anchor support may be sutured to the heart tissue. The anchor support may include one or more openings and or arms over which one or more sutures not shown for clarity may be passed to stitch the anchor support to the heart tissue and secure the anchor assembly . The mounting surface of the anchor support may have a curvature which substantially corresponds to the curvature of the heart tissue proximate to the incision site about the apex . The anchor support may optionally be coated covered wrapped with pledget material. The pledget material facilitates tissue to growth over the anchor support thereby further enhancing the connection between the anchor assembly and the heart .

Other anchor assemblies can be used to secure the implant to the heart . For example a one or more prongs barbs staples clamps and or helical screws can be used to secure the implant to the heart. Additionally the anchor assembly may be eliminated. For example the implant may be secured to the heart using the shaft which may curl and secured to the heart for example using sutures staples or the like.

With reference now to the implant is shown secured to the heart . Once the anchor assembly is secured to the heart the shaft may be cut proximate to the anchor assembly . When installed the spacer is configured to interact and or cooperate with e.g. engage at least a portion of the native mitral valve e.g. the cusps to reduce and or eliminate excessive regurgitation. As such the configuration and or geometries of the spacer may depend upon the particulars of the condition of the patient s mitral valve and the damage thereto. In addition the implant e.g. the spacer and or the shaft has sufficient overall rigidity to maintain the spacer within the mitral valve such that the implant performs as intended.

According to one aspect the present disclosure features a trans apical implant. The implant includes a spacer defining spacer cavity configured to be expanded from a retracted position a shaft extending from the spacer the shaft defining an inflation lumen fluidly coupled to the spacer cavity and configured to be fluidly coupled to an expansion medium source and a spacer valve assembly disposed within at least one of the spacer or shaft the spacer valve assembly configured to allow selectively allow an expansion medium to flow into the spacer cavity to be selectively expand the spacer from a retracted position to an expanded position.

According to another aspect the present disclosure features an implant delivery system. The implant delivery system includes an introducer having at least one lumen and an implant. The implant is configured to be received in the lumen and includes a spacer and a shaft. The spacer defines spacer cavity configured to be expanded from a retracted position while disposed within the lumen of the introducer. The shaft is configured to extend from the spacer and defines an inflation lumen fluidly coupled to the spacer cavity and configured to be fluidly coupled to an expansion medium source.

According to yet another aspect the present disclosure features a method of trans apically delivering an implant within a heart. The implant includes a shaft and a spacer configured to interact with at least a portion of at least one cusp of a mitral valve to at least partially restrict a flow of blood through the heart valve in a closed position. The method includes trans apically advancing an introducer through an incision in an apex of the heart into a left ventricle advancing the introducer through the mitral valve into a left atrium advancing the implant through a lumen defined by the introducer into the left atrium wherein the shaft extends within the lumen from the spacer and beyond the incision in the heart introducing an expansion medium through the shaft to expand the spacer locating the spacer within the mitral valve to reduce mitral regurgitation removing the introducer from the heart and securing the implant to an external surface of the heart proximate to the apex.
