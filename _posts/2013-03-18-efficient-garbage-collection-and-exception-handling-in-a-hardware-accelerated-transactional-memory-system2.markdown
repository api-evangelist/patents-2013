title: Efficient garbage collection and exception handling in a hardware accelerated transactional memory system
abstract: Handling garbage collection and exceptions in hardware assisted transactions. Embodiments are practiced in a computing environment including a hardware assisted transaction system. A method includes beginning a hardware assisted transaction, raising an exception while in the hardware assisted transaction, including creating an exception object, determining that the transaction should be rolled back, and as a result of determining that the transaction should be rolled back, marshaling the exception object out of the hardware assisted transaction.
