The present disclosure relates generally to generating and displaying maps within a web based mapping system and more particularly to generating and displaying suggestions of points of interest based on user context information.

The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor to the extent it is described in this background section as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.

Many mobile computing devices such as cellular phones tablet computers notebooks etc. incorporate global positioning system GPS applications and related hardware. When actuated on the device the GPS applications may communicate with a GPS transmitter or other GPS hardware on the device and a backend application server to provide a digital map of an area around the device s current position to a user as well as label data and place page data. While traveling a tourist may use a web based or other mapping system to display a map of their proposed destination. Similarly because these computing devices are mobile users travel with the devices and use them to display maps of unfamiliar destinations. Likewise users may use these devices while in their local area to display maps of familiar destinations.

Typical mapping systems generate and display identical maps for every user. For example the mapping system may receive a request from both a local resident and a tourist for a map of a particular area. In response to the request typical mapping systems return identical or nearly identical maps regardless of whether the requestor is a local resident of the requested map area or a tourist visiting or searching for the same requested map area.

Features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims hereof. Additionally other embodiments may omit one or more or all of the features and advantages described in this summary.

The figures depict a preferred embodiment for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art may readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.

For simplicity the client device is illustrated with a single processor to execute various modules stored in the device memory as described herein. The client device in other embodiments may include additional processing units not shown such as a graphics processing unit GPU configured to facilitate image rendering on the display for example. Further the mapping module may utilize a library of graphics functions for efficiently generating a map image. For example the memory may store a plugin such as an OpenGL or Direct3D library having functions for rendering graphics which various applications executing on the client including the mapping module may access via an application programming interface API . In another embodiment the memory stores a plugin particularly suitable for browser applications such as WebGL for example. Also in some embodiments the memory stores additional software components that facilitate efficient rendering of images via the display device . For example the memory may store an Adobe Flash plugin or an O3D plugin.

While the system is illustrated in as including the mapping system and the point of interest selection system as backend components the components and functions of the system described herein may also be incorporated on the client computing device . For example the POI selection system may be implemented as computer executable instructions of the mapping module the mapping system or as a separate module or system.

In some embodiments the point of interest selection system may include one or more modules stored within memories of the various system components. The modules may include instructions that when executed by a processor identify a user of a client computing device that is currently using the mapping system as tied to a particular geographic region. In some embodiments the point of interest selection system may execute instructions in a user classification module to compare a current location of the user via a GPS module to other data such as the user profile data to indicate whether the user may be currently classified as e.g. a tourist or a local . This classification may be used as an indication of the user s familiarity with POIs within a given geographic area. Using this classification the user s location and any other available context data the promotion module may select POIs and or categories of POIs from a point of interest database . These selected POIs and or categories of POIs for promotion may be communicated back to the mapping system and or directly to the user device over the network .

With reference to a method may cause the system to execute instructions to determine POI data for promotion on the user device . At block the system may execute instructions to receive a mapping data request which contains location data and user identity. The location data corresponds to a location of the computing device that sent the mapping data request. The computing device may determine its location using a GPS module signal triangulation e.g. cellular towers wi fi signals radio signals etc. or other location methods. The user identify may include an indication of a user that is currently using the computing device that sent the mapping data request. For example the indication may correspond to a user profile for a user that is logged on to a web or other service using the computing device. The client device may also automatically send the mapping data request upon the occurrence or satisfaction of one or more conditions. Occurrences or conditions may include a user may initiating a mapping application at the computing device the device operating system detecting a new location of the device e.g. a system refresh when a user lands in a foreign airport etc. a mapping application detecting a new location of the device while the mapping application is running in the background of the device etc.

At block the system may execute instructions to compare location data corresponding to a client computing device with user profile data to determine a user classification as a tourist or a local . The user classification may indicate a degree of familiarity with the location of the client computing device.

At block the system may execute instructions to determine POIs and or categories of POIs for promotion on the client computing device. In addition to the user classification and location data this determination may make use of any other available data such as the time of day weather personal interests personal interests or experiences of friends from social media data etc. Based on this information examples of promoted POIs may include suggested nightclubs where the time and location indicate the user may be concluding dinner a currency exchange where the location indicates that the user may be arriving by plane in a new foreign location etc. This determination may also use information about the user and his her friends recommendations using social media data or recommendations based on classification such as tourist friendly recommended by local experts popularity etc.

Typically the promotion of a POI will be accomplished by displaying these POIs and or categories of POIs as suggestions to the user. In addition to determining the selection of POIs and or categories of POIs to promote the method may also determine the display order of promoted elements.

At block the system may execute instructions to send the promotion data containing the selected POIs and or categories of POIs optionally in a particular order to the client computing device. The client computing device may then process the promotion data to display the various promoted POIs and related information to the user.

At block the system may execute instructions to determine if the user has selected a category of POIs. If yes the method may further select POIs and or categories of POIs for promotion. These steps may repeat for as many layers of categories and sub categories are present.

At block the system may execute instructions to receive a request for mapping data corresponding to a particular promoted POI upon selection of the displayed promoted POI by the user. At block the system may execute instructions to send the requested mapping data to the client computing device in response to the user selection of the promoted POI.

Selecting the Nearby From Your History element may cause the computing device to execute instructions to display various POIs from a user s search history or user profile that are nearby to the current location of the computing device . Selecting the explore element may cause the computing device to execute instructions to display a further screen . Screen may include each of the explore categories and also sub categories . The subcategories may include further categories based on one or more criteria. For example the criteria may include POIs that your friends have liked using social media data POIs based on the user classification as a tourist or a local POIs based on purely local users ratings and also POIs based on personal profile or other data e.g. search history favorites profile information indicating hobbies or interests etc. .

Selecting the Eat category may cause the computing device to execute instructions to display a further screen . Screen may include each of the sub categories as well as POIs that have been identified as related to criteria within each sub category . For example here the user has selected the Eat category . POIs are arranged under sub categories . These sub categories may be included or omitted or the order selected depending on the context data i.e. tourist or local user . Further sub categories may also be suggested.

As described the computer system and method provides points of interest POIs suggestions to a user of a mapping application on a computing device. These suggestions are determined based on context information such as e.g. the location of the user the familiarity of the user with the location time of day information about the POIs and other user profile data. Information about the POIs such as e.g. categories sub categories recommendations and distance can be used to determine the suggestions and organize suggestions into categories of POIs. Once suggestions of POIs and or categories of POIs have been suggested to the user the user may navigate through the suggestions and subsequently request more information on the suggestions. If the user selects a suggested POI information on that particular POI is requested and that POI is displayed in the mapping application on the computing device.

Additionally certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code or instructions embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal wherein the code is executed by a processor or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. application program interfaces APIs . 

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of this specification are presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . These algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or a combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information.

As used herein any reference to some embodiments or an embodiment means that a particular element feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase in some embodiments in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Some embodiments may be described using the expression coupled and connected along with their derivatives. For example some embodiments may be described using the term coupled to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term coupled however may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other but yet still co operate or interact with each other. The embodiments are not limited in this context.
