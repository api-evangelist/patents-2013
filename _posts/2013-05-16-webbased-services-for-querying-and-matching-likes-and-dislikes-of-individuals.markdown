Referring now to a flow diagram depicting steps of an embodiment of a method for providing matches based on one or more matching criteria entered by a user is shown and described. In brief overview a user selects step categories to match as one of the matching criteria. The user further selects step people to match and or the number of results to display and provides step one or more criteria for match. Matching items are determined step based on a matching algorithm. Match scores and rank are determined step which are compared step to each other and results are displayed.

Selecting step categories for match can be done in many ways. In one embodiment only one category is selected for matching. In another embodiment a plurality of categories is selected for matching. In still another embodiment a level of granularity can be specified by selecting one or more levels of subcategories under a given category or subcategory. In one embodiment the selection is done by a user. In another embodiment the selection is done by an automated program or application. In still another embodiment the selection is done using a third party service .

Individuals or users among whom matching is to be done may be selected step in a plurality of ways. In one embodiment a user selects the individuals for matching. In another embodiment the selection is done by an automated system. In one embodiment the user may individually select one or more friends and or users as a match criterion. In another embodiment the user may select a group to include all users and or non users associated with the group. In still another embodiment the user may select himself or herself in order to find other users with substantially similar items and or profiles. In yet another embodiment when the user selects himself or herself the user s items are used as key items to match against. In a further embodiment when the user does not select himself herself the items associated with the first person in the list of chosen people are used as the key items to match against. In another embodiment the user may specify the person whose items are used as the key items.

The user may provide step one or more criteria for the matching process. In some embodiments the categories and people are enough to specify the search criteria and hence the step may be optional. In one embodiment any criterion may be provided as a criterion for match. Examples of such criteria include but are not limited to keywords level of preference minimum match score rank and any other criteria as apparent to one skilled in the art. In another embodiment the matching criteria may be provided based on one or more emoticons. In still another embodiment one or more portions of the taxonomy are identified as the matching criteria. In yet other embodiments one or more predetermined templates based on one or more domains categories or subcategories are used for providing the matching criteria.

Matching items are determined step in a plurality of possible ways. One or more matching algorithms software and techniques may be used in determining a match. In one embodiment text matching of item names associated with different users is conducted using one or more text matching algorithms. In another embodiment items from a plurality of users are compared for matching. In still another embodiment algorithms such as AGREP Approximate GREP are used to implement the text matching. In other embodiments any string searching algorithm as apparent to one skilled in the art may be used for the text matching. Examples of such algorithms include but are not limited to na ve string search Rabin Karp string search finite state automata based search Knuth Morris Pratt algorithm Boyer Moore algorithm Aho Corasick algorithm Commentz Walter algorithm and bitmap algorithm. In some embodiments the matching may be based on one or more statistical measures such as Levenshtein distance Hamming distance Damerau Levenshtein distance Kullback Leibler distance and any other statistical measure as apparent to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment a match is determined based on the statistical measures for one or more items being within a predetermined limit to each other. In another embodiment a match is determined based on one or more items exactly matching the search criteria.

Items can be matched between users using item names and categories. One item may feature in a first category for a first user and a second category for a second user. In one embodiment items between two users are matched with preference to one of item name and category. In another embodiment if a high confidence match for an item is found in a different category the item is reported under one category. In still another embodiment the item may be reported under a plurality of categories with optional notes marking the duplicates. In yet another embodiment for items that have multiple categories only one category is used for a report. As an example if a user s item matches with one or more items associated with one or more friends categories are checked for a match and the category with the highest frequency across all friends is used for the report. In another embodiment the category may be determined using any other algorithm and or consideration.

Match scores are determined step to compute ranking of matching items. The match score used for ranking is based on an outcome of one or more mathematical operations. In one embodiment a preference intensity PI is calculated based on the degree of preference indicated by a user. In another embodiment the calculation of PI is based on the degree of preference indicated by a user via the rating emoticons . As an example an indication of a strong like like dislike and strong dislike may carry scores of 2 1 1 and 2 respectively. In still another embodiment summation of all user preference scores indicates a total PI score for a matching item. In some embodiments the total PI score indicates whether the overall match is positive or negative. By way of example if 4 users are matched on an item and there are 2 strong likes 1 strong dislike and 1 dislike the total PI score is 2 2 2 1 1.

In one embodiment a weighted frequency is calculated as a percentage score based on the balance of positive and negative preferences. In another embodiment whether a match is positive or negative is determined based on the PI score. In the example discussed above a positive PI indicates a positive match a negative PI indicates a negative match and a 0 PI indicates a neutral match. In still another embodiment a percentage of majority is calculated to determine the match score.

Continuing with the above example a PI score of 1 indicates a positive match. The weighting factor is calculated as number of positive matches multiplied by respective scores divided by sum of absolute value of all scores . In the above example the weighting factor as a percentage is therefore 2 2 7 100 which is approximately 57 . In one embodiment the matched items may be ranked based on their match scores. Even though determination of match scores is described with respect to the algorithm above it can be appreciated that the match score may be determined using one or more algorithms tools and mathematical statistical logical and Boolean operations as apparent to one skilled in the art.

Match scores are compared step with one another and the results displayed. In one embodiment the results may be displayed in an ascending or descending order of ranks computed on the basis of match scores. In case of substantially equal ranks for a plurality of items the plurality of items are displayed in alphabetical order order of appearance random order or any other order.
