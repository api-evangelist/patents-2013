This application is a continuation of pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 824 029 filed on Jun. 25 2010 the contents of which is incorporated in its entirety by reference.

The subject technology relates in general to virtual disk images driver injection or streaming and more particularly to apparatus and method for network driver injection into a target image.

In one aspect operating system OS streaming is a technology to boot a computer or a virtual machine from an image file stored on a network. The actual operating system may be centrally located on a server and may stream to a client device on demand. In one aspect such an image file may be sometimes referred to as a virtual disk. 

Typically a virtual disk created from a specific device can be streamed to multiple devices if they bear the same hardware characteristics. More specifically the motherboard the network adapter and the video card must be the same in this typical scenario. Being able to use a single virtual disk to boot multiple devices greatly simplifies information technology IT department s maintenance effort and cost. For example to perform Windows updates a system administrator only needs to apply the changes on the centrally located common virtual disk once. All client devices booted from this virtual disk will receive the changes.

Various aspects of the disclosure relate to methods apparatuses machine readable storage media encoded with instructions computer programs and or other means for providing network driver injection into a target image.

In one aspect the method may transform the target image to be compatible with one or more source machines. In one aspect the method may facilitate operating system streaming over a network.

The instructions may comprise code for some or all of the following facilitating access to a source system registry file of a source machine facilitating access to a target system registry file of the target image without copying the target image determining whether one or more source network interface cards of the source machine are compatible with the target image and if the one or more source network interface cards are not compatible with the target image performing network interface driver injection. The target image may comprise an operating system.

The operation of performing network interface driver injection may comprise some or all of the following determining one or more source network components associated with the one or more source network interface cards determining source network configuration of the one or more source network components determining target network configuration of one or more target network components of the target image determining whether the source network configuration conflicts with the target network configuration if the source network configuration conflicts with the target network configuration adjusting the source network configuration so that the source network configuration does not conflict with the target network configuration and injecting to the target system registry file the source network configuration of the one or more source network components.

The operation of performing network interface driver injection may further comprise facilitating copying of one or more files associated with the one or more source network components of the source machine onto the target image.

In yet a further aspect of the disclosure a method may build a computer program for providing network driver injection into a target image. In one aspect this may transform the target image to be compatible with one or more computing machines. In one aspect the method may facilitate operating system streaming over a network.

The method may comprise some or all of the following selecting a first computing machine and a second computing machine wherein the first computing machine comprises a first network interface card the second computing machine comprises a second network interface card wherein configuration of the second network interface card is different from configuration of the first network interface card building a first virtual disk image of the first computing machine building a second virtual disk image that is compatible with the first computing machine and the second computing machine booting the first computing machine using the first virtual disk image extracting first system registry information of the first computing machine after booting the first computing machine using the first virtual disk image the first system registry information comprising configuration values for the first network interface card based on the first virtual disk image booting the first computing machine using the second virtual disk image extracting second system registry information of the first computing machine after booting the first computing machine using the second virtual disk image the second system registry information comprising configuration values for the first network interface card and the second network interface card based on the second virtual disk image determining network driver injection components based on differences between the first system registry information and the second system registry information and based on registries that do not affect network functionalities injecting the network driver injection components into the first virtual disk image and producing the computer program based on the network driver injection components.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology. Like components are labeled with identical element numbers for ease of understanding.

An aspect of the disclosure provides using driver injection to enhance an existing virtual disk image to support multiple heterogeneous platforms for streaming.

Since it is very rare that there is only one type of platform in any OS streaming deployment it is desirable to have a single virtual disk image streamable to multiple client platforms bearing different hardware characteristics. In one aspect such a virtual disk image may be sometimes referred to as a golden image.

In one aspect the subject technology enables a user to inject OS streaming related drivers and configurations into an existing virtual disk image to support multiple heterogeneous platforms for OS streaming The resulting virtual disk image becomes a golden image.

On an OS streaming deployment a customer may have 100 client devices scattered in nine branch offices. The 100 devices are purchased from 10 different manufacturers models. If a golden image is not available the customer needs to create 10 different virtual disk images each supporting a unique hardware platform. A typical VDisk image is 10 GB in size.

To deploy OS streaming on all branch offices the customer needs to distribute all 10 VDisk images from the headquarters to all nine branch offices. That is 10 10 GB 9 900 GB of data traveling on wire which is typically low bandwidth channels. To keep the images up to date with latest OS patches each of the 10 VDisk images needs to be updated from the headquarters. The changes applied on all 10 images would then need to be pushed to each branch office again on low bandwidth channels.

If a golden image is available the customer only needs to create a single virtual disk image supporting all 10 platforms and 100 client devices . To deploy OS streaming on all branch offices the customer would need to distribute only one VDisk image from the headquarters to the nine branch offices. That is 10 GB 9 90 GB of data traveling on wire which is ten times less than without a golden image. To keep the image up to date with latest OS patches the changes need to be applied on only the single golden image and distributed to the branch offices subsequently.

Obviously the capability to create a golden image supporting multiple heterogeneous platforms greatly improves the usability of OS streaming and truly achieves scalability on an enterprise level.

A first approach enables a user to create a golden virtual disk image to support multiple heterogeneous platforms for OS streaming. This approach however requires installation of a common network interface card e.g. a network adapter on each source platforms during the virtual disk creation process. It involves opening up each source platform and finding a spare bus interface slot to accommodate the new network interface card. It is challenging to common users and often not feasible on platforms where a spare bus slot is not available which is the case on most laptops. It is also not desirable because opening up a computer chassis may void the manufacturer s warranty. This approach also requires all source platforms to have OS installation that uses the same hardware abstraction layer HAL .

An aspect of the subject technology overcomes the drawbacks of the foregoing approach. For example an aspect of the subject technology does not require a common network interface card among different source platforms does not require a user to open up each source platform and does not require a spare bus slot to insert a new network interface card. In addition an aspect of the subject technology does not require all source platforms to have the same HAL.

A second approach enables a user to create a golden virtual disk image to support multiple heterogeneous platforms for OS streaming. This approach helps a user to prepare an OS installation on a physical hard disk which contains all drivers for all source platforms before capturing a snapshot of the hard disk installation into a virtual disk image. The process involves backing up a hard disk OS installation of one platform to a file e.g. a wup file restoring the file from the first source platform to a non active partition of a second source platform. The process also involves booting the second source platform from the restored partition and installing drivers for the second source platform. The resulting hard disk OS installation which resides on the restored partition contains all drivers from both the first and the second source platforms. Such backup and restore process needs to be repeated on all source platforms.

The repeated backup and restore process is long and tedious. It often may take hours to create a golden image for three to four platforms. It also requires each source platform except the first to have at least two hard disk partitions one for boot up and another for restore e.g. a wup file . If source platforms have an operating system pre installed on a single partition a user needs to remove the existing installation re partition the hard disk and re install the OS first. This approach also requires all source platforms to have OS installation on a hard disk that uses the same hardware abstraction layer HAL .

An aspect of the subject technology overcomes the drawbacks of the foregoing second approach. For example an aspect of the subject technology does not require multiple hard disk partitions on any source platforms does not require copying of an entire hard disk image onto a source platform and does not require copying of an entire operating system image onto a source platform. In addition an aspect of the subject technology does not require all source platforms to have the same HAL. In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure while the foregoing features are not required the subject technology can also function in the presence of the foregoing drawbacks.

A third approach utilizes a process to create a common virtual disk image between a physical device and a virtual machine. This method can create a common virtual disk for only a single platform and a virtual machine. It does not achieve the goal of creating a single virtual disk for any number of heterogeneous hardware platforms.

An aspect of the subject technology overcomes the drawbacks of the foregoing third approach. For example an aspect of the subject technology can create a golden virtual disk image for any number of heterogeneous hardware platforms.

A fourth approach uses a method of preinstalling plug and play PnP drivers into an offline Windows OS image to be deployed to new hardware. An original equipment manufacturer OEM or corporate IT staff may utilize this method. This method can be utilized on a Windows image targeted to boot a hard disk physically attached to a target device only. It however cannot be used on a virtual disk image which resides on the network since a virtual disk image residing on a network needs a network interface card bound to an OS streaming driver designed specifically to support OS streaming This fourth approach does not inject the binding relationship between the network interface card and the OS streaming driver and hence cannot be used on a virtual disk image. Furthermore this approach supports only a plug and play driver.

An aspect of the subject technology overcomes the drawbacks of the foregoing fourth approach. For example an aspect of the subject technology can support injecting a network interface card driver and corresponding network components onto plug and play interfaces as well as non plug and play interfaces.

In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure the subject technology can provide among others the following advantages.

Shown below is an aspect of the subject technology written in C programming language but the subject technology is not limited to C and can be written in other programming languages.

This function looks into the Net Device class key and locates a subkey which RootDevice contains target node s GUID.

FindDeviceClassEntry In one aspect this function FindDeviceClassEntry may find the Device Class registry entry for a target network component. This function looks into the NDIS LAN class key and locates a subkey value that matches a target node s GUID. The parent key of the above subkey is the Device Class entry.

FindLastSubKey In one aspect this function FindLastSubKey may find the last subkey index under regKey. This function may take one input parameter 

AssignNewNetClassSubKey In one aspect a function AssignNewNet ClassSubKey may recursively assign the next NetClass subkey number to a to be injected network component and its upper nodes.

 HKLM  SYSTEM  ControlSet00x Control Class . Each functional network component registered to the OS is represented by a subkey under such key. Subkeys are arranged in 4 digits consecutive numeric strings e.g. 0000 0001 0002 . . . . A new network component registered to the OS occupies the next number up subkey. A network component at a Source can be injected to a Target by copying its NetClass registry trees from the Source to a valid unused NetClass subkey in the Target. This function finds out the valid unused subkey to be used in Target. This function may take two input parameters 

AssignNewBusSpecificID In one aspect this function AssignNewBusSpecificID may recursively assign newBusSpecificID to a to be injected network component and its upper nodes.

For example in Windows OS the Enum registry key contains the subkeys for specific hardware components a computer uses. The OS uses this information to allocate resources e.g. IO addresses and interrupt numbers for the components .

Each controller bus type has its own subkey under the Enum key e.g. PCI ROOT . The PCI subkey contains entries for the plug and play equipment on a peripheral component interconnect PCI bus. Each PCI equipment is represented by a registry key under the PCI subkey bearing the manufacturer or vendor and product ID of the equipment. Information of a specific PCI equipment instance is stored under a subkey representing the bus locations. Hence the full path for hardware equipment under the Enum registry key is constructed by its bus type PCI hardware ID and bus specific ID. If a to be injected network component is a PCI device its bus specific ID stays the same after it is moved to the Target because the component sits on the same PCI bus slot. The ROOT subkey contains entries for legacy non plug and play hardware. Equipment instances under the ROOT device subkey are arranged by 4 digits consecutive numeric string e.g. 0000 0001 etc . Such numeric subkey string is its bus specific ID. If a to be injected network component is a ROOT device it occupies a new bus specific ID bearing the next number up subkey in the Target. This function may take two input parameters 

AssignNewDeviceClassKey In one aspect this function AssignNewDeviceClassKey may recursively assign the csNewDeviceClassKey value to a to be injected network component and its upper nodes.

If a target network component s csOldBusSpecificID is equal to csNewBusSpecificID csNewDeviceClassKey value is the same as csOldDeviceClassKey.

Otherwise the token within the old csOldDeviceClassKey value is changed to token which becomes its csNewDeviceClassKey value.

TallyNetworkDescriptionInstances In one aspect this function TallyNetworkDescriptionInstances tallies the number of Driver Description instances that will appear in a Target VDisk after injecting a network component and its upper nodes. This function stores the information in a string to pointer mapping list m NetworkInstanceList. During driver injection information in m NetworkInstanceList is used to update the Descriptions registry key under Class Network registry key at Target.

AssignNewInfPath In one aspect this function AssignNewInfPath may set the csNewInfPath field of a to be injected net node. This is the path where the OS would find the installation file for a target component after it is moved to the Target.

Windows OS stores all driver installation files under Windows inf folder of the system volume. Windows native drivers bear a unique name that is different than others e.g. netpsa.inf for a packet scheduler driver . Installation files provided by third party vendors will be renamed to e.g. oemx.inf where x is a unique number that exists in the current device. The driver installation file for a network component from a third party vendor may bear a different oem.inf number after copying from a Source to a Target. This function finds out the last oem.inf number used in the Target and assign the next number up for the driver installation file of a to be injected network component and its upper nodes. This function may take three input parameters 

CopyInfFile In one aspect this function CopyInfFile may copy a driver installation file for a to be injected network component from a Source to a Target unless an inf file already exists in the Target. The inf file name at the Source is recorded in the csOldInfPath of a NETNODE structure. The inf file name to be used after copying to the Target is recorded in the csNewInfPath of a NETNODE structure.

CopyDriverFile In one aspect this function CopyDriverFile may copy a driver binary file for a to be injected network component from a Source to a Target unless the driver file already exists in the Target.

MergeEnumSubKey In one aspect this function MergeEnumSubKey may merge the Enumsubkeys of the to be injected network component and its uppers from a Source to a Target.

AddLinkage In one aspect this function AddLinkage may enumerate all services registry keys at a Target. If a subkey s existing linkage bind linkage Route and linkage Export values contain csRefGUID this function constructs a similar string by replacing csRefGUID to csGUID of the to be injected network component then adds a new string into the linkage bind linkage Route and linkage Export registry values. This is to bind the new NIC and or network component to those services.

AddSvcInterfaces In one aspect this function AddSvcInterfaces may enumerate subkeys under services registry keys at a Target. If the key name matches the csRefGUID value this function constructs a similar key name for a target NIC by replacing csRefGUID to target NIC s GUID. This function then looks for this key from a Source. If found the function copies the whole key from the Source to the Target

AddRemoteAccessInterfaces In one aspect this function AddRemoteAccess Interfaces may add an interface to a Target s Remote Access service registry key to represent the new NIC. This function may perform the following

In one aspect the machines utilized may be different among the three stages A B and C. In another aspect some of the machines utilized may be the same among stages B and C or possibly among stages A B and C.

In one aspect of the disclosure a Driver Injection process involves injecting information of selected network components present in a Source Platform into a Target VDisk. By doing this the operating system in the Target VDisk when booted up on the Source Platform will recognize the network component s present in the Source Platform know where to find the driver binary for such component s and how to bind such component s into its network stack. The result is a functional chain of network drivers network stack capable of performing normal network activities as well as OS streaming.

A computer network system may include one ore more remote Source Platforms in communication with a Target Platform via a network . In one aspect the Target Platform is configured to allow remote sessions e.g. remote desktop sessions wherein users can access applications and files on the Target Platform by logging onto the Target Platform from a Source Platform .

In one aspect a Target Platform can be stationary. In another aspect a Target Platform can be mobile. In certain configurations a Target Platform may be any device that can represent a Source Platform. In one aspect a Target Platform may include one or more Target Platforms.

In one example a first device is remote to a second device when the first device is not directly connected to the second device. In one example a first remote device may be connected to a second device over a communication network such as a Local Area Network LAN a Wide Area Network WAN and or other network.

When a Source Platform and a Target Platform are remote with respect to each other a Source Platform may connect to a Target Platform over a network for example via a modem connection a LAN connection including the Ethernet or a broadband WAN connection including DSL Cable T1 T3 Fiber Optics Wi Fi or a mobile network connection including GSM GPRS 3G WiMax or other network connection. A network can be a LAN network a WAN network a wireless network the Internet an intranet or other network. A network may include one or more routers for routing data between Source Platforms and or Target Platforms. A remote device e.g. Source Platform Target Platform on a network may be addressed by a corresponding network address such as but not limited to an Internet protocol IP address an Internet name a Windows Internet name service WINS name a domain name or other system name. These illustrate some examples as to how one device may be remote to another device. However the subject technology is not limited to these examples.

In one aspect the terms local and remote are relative terms and a Source Platform may be referred to as a local Source Platform or a remote Source Platform depending on whether a Source Platform is described from the Source Platform side or from the Target Platform side respectively. Similarly a Target Platform may be referred to as a local Target Platform or a remote Target Platform depending on whether the Target Platform is described from the Target Platform side or from a Source Platform side respectively.

In one aspect devices placed on a Source Platform side e.g. devices connected directly to a Source Platform s or to one another using wires or wirelessly may be referred to as local devices with respect to a Source Platform and remote devices with respect to a Target Platform. Similarly devices placed on a Target Platform side e.g. devices connected directly to a Target Platform s or to one another using wires or wirelessly may be referred to as local devices with respect to a Target Platform and remote devices with respect to a Source Platform.

The processing system may include a general purpose processor or a specific purpose processor for executing instructions and may further include a machine readable medium such as a volatile or non volatile memory for storing data and or instructions for software programs.

The disclosure provided under this subheading is simply one exemplary scenario and does not limit the subject technology.

In one approach a single virtual disk image may be streamed to multiple client devices as long as the devices have similar hardware characteristics. In this example the mother board the Preboot eXecution Environment PXE capable network card and the video card need to be the same.

According to another approach a technique can facilitate creation of a golden virtual disk image to support multiple heterogeneous client platforms in which the mother board network card or video card is different. The process involves first creating a hard disk OS installation containing all drivers for all source platforms then installing a streaming component such as the WSM Client software and finally capturing a snapshot of the OS installation to a virtual disk image.

In accordance with an aspect of the subject technology the driver injection feature of the subject technology greatly shortens the time and procedures involved in creating a golden image. The disclosure in this subheading describes how to use driver injection to create a golden image to support client devices e.g. Source Platforms with heterogeneous hardware characteristics for one exemplary scenario.

In one aspect the driver injection to prepare a golden virtual disk for streaming may involve some or all of the following steps 

Since many of the steps are standard operations the disclosure under this subheading is focused on discussing the steps that are specific to the driver injection feature.

The driver injection process starts with a VDisk for the first platform. In one aspect the first platform needs to bear the lowest HAL among all source platforms. For example if the native HAL for three source platforms are 

This base VDisk can be a new disk created from the first platform or any existing VDisk streamable to the first platform.

Although it is suggested to start with a base VDisk that has latest WSM Client this is not a requirement. One can use a VDisk created from older streaming manager releases.

During the driver injection process the base VDisk may be configured to private persistent or volatile cache mode. However using different cache modes has different implications 

In one aspect to inject an NIC driver of a device to a VDisk the following exemplary steps may be utilized 

Once the source platform successfully boots from the new VDisk Windows s hardware discovery wizard will prompt to install drivers for hardware found in the source platform. The drivers and corresponding .inf files can usually be found in the local hard disk.

Occasionally the local hard disk volume is not assigned a driver letter. If this is the case go to My Computer Manage Disk Manager right click on local hard disk select Change driver letter and Path then Add a drive letter.

One can point the hardware installation wizard to the local disk drive windows inf which contains all the driver inf files. Driver binaries are usually under windows system32 drivers windows system32 or windows folders.

It is found that on some platforms installing video and audio drivers from binaries found in local disk causes the display or audio hardware to malfunction. It is recommended that one install these drivers from complete driver installation packages provided by the hardware vendor if possible.

In order to install drivers for newly discovered hardware one may need to use a keyboard and or a mouse to select some menus from the hardware discovery wizard. If the Universal Serial Bus USB controller driver is not already installed on the VDisk one will not be able to use the USB keyboard and mouse. Hence it is recommended that a PS2 keyboard and mouse be attached to the platform when it first boots from the new VDisk. Once the USB controller driver is installed the USB keyboard mouse can be used in subsequent boots. For a platform that does not have a PS2 keyboard mouse interface one may not be able to proceed with drivers installations.

In one aspect it is recommend that a user does not try to upgrade the driver for the PXE enabled Ethernet network adapter. Doing so can cause a VDisk to hang. A driver upgrade for the PXE enabled Ethernet network adapter needs to be done before driver injection when the platform is booted from a hard disk.

Installing some wireless network drivers may cause network stack re bind which in turn may cause a VDisk to hang. If this is the case one may need to roll back the driver injection changes by deleting the cache file for the target device re injecting the NIC driver to the VDisk and disabling the wireless network adapter from the new VDisk. If wireless network adapter functionality is needed one may need to use a traditional tool to create a golden VDisk.

In one aspect if the VDisk is in persistent or volatile cache mode once the VDisk is confirmed to work properly on the source platform the changes made on the cache file may need to be committed to the VDisk itself. This can be done by merging the cache file for the source platform into the VDisk file.

When a VDisk is created through a normal image capturing process it can be streamed to multiple devices bearing the same hardware characteristics as the original device from where the VDisk was captured. However in some cases even if a device looks the same e.g. the same model from the same manufacturer as the original device streaming may fail. This is because the network card between the two devices may have slightly different revision number or may be located on a different PCI slot. These subtle differences between the network cards can cause the VDisk to fail in booting. When attempting to stream a device from an incompatible VDisk a device typically hangs at Windows boot up progress bar.

In the past a user did not realize the incompatibility until actually streaming the VDisk to a target device. WSM 3.5 introduces a tool to detect compatibility between an existing VDisk and a device. This tool may be especially useful in large streaming deployment where thousands of client devices from the same manufacturing model are used. It is often impractical to find out that a VDisk is not compatible with some client devices at branch offices after the VDisk has been qualified and deployed from the headquarters.

This tool can be run on a device without installing the streaming software WSM Client. It may take one input parameter a path to the system hive file of the VDisk. It generates a log file showing the compatibility check result. Below describes some typical steps to use this tool in a large scale streaming deployment scenario
