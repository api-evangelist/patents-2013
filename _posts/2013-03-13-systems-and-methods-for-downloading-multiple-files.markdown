The presently disclosed embodiments deal generally with the field of document management and more specifically with downloading multiple files or folders as a zip file.

Microsoft SharePoint is a central web application platform associated with document management and web content management systems for various enterprise requirements. Microsoft SharePoint was first released in year 2001 and the latest version was released in 2010 as SharePoint 2010. People can manage files and set up their web sites for sharing with others using the SharePoint. Typically a SharePoint Site is a collection of pages lists and libraries configured to achieve an objective. Sites have the ability to be configured or customized in a number of ways. SharePoint provides a central location to put content such as files or folders. The content can be accessed and modified within a web browser or using a client application on a desktop or smartphone. The content is stored in libraries and lists in the SharePoint 2010 environment. The libraries include a number of files or folders which users can browse and download depending on the access permissions. Different types of libraries exist in the SharePoint 2010 such as picture library documents library forms library report library etc.

SharePoint 2010 allows users to download only a single file at a time and does not allow the user to download multiple files simultaneously. Therefore downloading multiple files in the SharePoint 2010 is a time consuming process.

The present disclosure describes a system to facilitate a user to download multiple files in a SharePoint environment and primarily in SharePoint 2010. The system includes a detection module configured to detect a selection of at least one item from a document library by a user. The item can be one or more file or folder which in turn can include one or more files or sub folders. The system also includes a download button configured to be activated on selection of the at least one item. The system further includes a packaging module configured to package the at least one item as a zip file based on the selection of the download button by the user. Furthermore the system includes a downloading module configured to download the zip file.

Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a computer implemented method to allow a user to download multiple files in a SharePoint environment. The method includes detecting a selection by a user of at least one item from a document library. The at least one item can be one or more files or folders including one or more files or sub folders. The method also includes activating a download button on selection of the at least one item. The method further includes packaging the at least one item as a zip file based on the selection of the download button by the user. Finally the method includes downloading the zip file.

Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a computer program product embodied on a computer readable medium having instructions to perform business center operations. The computer program product performs the steps of detecting a selection of at least one item from a document library by a user wherein the at least one item is at least one of a file or folder including a sub folder activating a download button on selection of the at least one item packaging the at least one item as a zip file based on the selection of the download button by the user and downloading the zip file.

The following detailed description is made with reference to the figures. Embodiments are described to illustrate the claimed invention not to limit its scope which is defined by the claims. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a variety of equivalent variations on the description that follows.

The present disclosure describes systems and methods that allow a user to download multiple files in a SharePoint environment. The system detects a selection of at least one item from a document library. The item can be a file or a folder. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the files or groups of files e.g. folders are limited to document files and do not include other content such as picture files or links. The system has a download button that gets activated when the user has selected at least one item. A packaging module of the system packages the selected item s as a zip file when the user selects the download button. The packaging module also creates folders in the zip file corresponding to the selected folders. Thereafter a downloading module downloads the zip file.

The disclosed system and method allows a user to select multiple files in a Microsoft SharePoint environment and download them as a single zip file. The disclosed system and method also allows the user to select the whole document set e.g. in the form of a folder along with its files as a zip file.

It should be noted that the description below does not set out specific details of manufacture or design of the various components. Those of skill in the art are familiar with such details and unless departures from those techniques are set out techniques and designs known in the art should be employed and those in the art are capable of choosing suitable manufacturing and design details.

Document Set Document set allows users to group multiple documents that support a single project or task together into a single entity. All documents or files in a Document Set share the metadata and the entire set can be versioned.

The present disclosure provides a solution for these problems of the existing SharePoint versions by disclosing systems and methods to allow the user to select and download multiple files as a single zip file. The system also allows the users to download a complete document set long with its folders and sub folders. The disclosed system can be installed and implemented in the existing SharePoint environment and on all versions of SharePoint.

Usually the libraries including the content are stored on a SharePoint server or database. The disclosed system allows the user to download multiple files detects a selection of one or more items from a document library and activates a Download as Zip button . The user selects this button to initiate the downloading process. Thereafter the system packages the multiple files into one zip file and downloads it onto the browser of the device . The user can access SharePoint sites using the browser and can download multiple files on his her browser.

The user can also download a complete document set including all its folders as a zip file. The user can select a complete document set or folder such as folder from the list of folders as shown. Then the system activates the Download as Zip button on the document library ribbon . Thereafter the system packages all the files and folders or sub folders in a zip file. The system also creates folders and sub folders in the zip file.

A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the steps of deploying the system may differ and may include more or less steps depending on the technical configuration of the device or the SharePoint platform . The system can be installed into existing SharePoint 2010 running on the device . In one embodiment the system can be installed as a plugin so that the user can enable or disable it on the device based on the requirement. In one embodiment the system can be installed on each device or on a shared device in the web or network only. The services of the system can be accessed from the shared device through the Internet local area network LAN wide area network WAN and so forth.

The system takes the list of item IDs and for each item ID the corresponding file from the document library and retrieves them into the SharePoint platform . Then the system by using a ZipBuilder class packages the files or retrieved folders as a zip file. The ZipBuilder class is a built in class in the java environment for creating zip files. When the selected items includes at least one folder the ZipBuider class builds the corresponding folders into the zip file as well and puts all the items that are in that selected folder into the corresponding zip file folder. The ZipBuilder class will also traverse through all the sub folders in the hierarchy within the folder.

The system includes a detection module for detecting a selection of at least one item from a document library in the SharePoint Environment. The user can select multiple items such as a file or a folder from a list of items in the library. Each of the items has an associated unique item Identity ID . After detecting the selection of multiple items by the user a download button of the system is activated. In one embodiment the download button is a download as zip button on a document library ribbon of the SharePoint interface. The system also includes a packaging module for packaging the selected items into a zip file. The packaging module is configured to retrieve one or more items corresponding to the selected items based on their item IDs from the SharePoint database or server. Then all the retrieved items are packaged into a single zip file. When the selected items includes one or more folders all files and sub folders of the selected folder are also retrieved and packaged in the respective folders and sub folders in the zip file. The packaging module packages only documents excluding the links or Uniform Resource Locator URL to the files in the zip file. The system further includes a downloading module for downloading the zip file at the user s device or browser. The downloading module will download the files as zip file but it will not download the links to these files or folders.

The system can download a complete document set including multiple folders or files as a single zip file. The system can support any level of SharePoint site s library. The system even allows the user to download files within a folder or a document set within a folder etc. but not links to the file s . The system supports downloading of files from all kinds of libraries including document panel and allitems.aspx page except the picture library and report library. The allitems.aspx is an built in page in any library. The system does not support downloading of items including list or survey other than the document library.
