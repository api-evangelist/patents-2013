Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station or a transceiver node and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicate with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission also known as a broadcast channel BC can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission also known as a multiple access channel MAC can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

The eNB can have multiple antennas used for transmission to the UEs allowing the eNB to use multiple input and multiple output MIMO . MIMO is a smart antenna technology that refers to the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance where input and output refer to a radio channel carrying the signal not necessarily to the devices having antennas. In MIMO up to eight transmit or receive antennas can be used or up to eight channels can be used for transmission of a resource.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system communication layers can include the physical PHY media access control MAC radio link control RLC packet data convergence protocol PDCP and radio resource control RRC layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system as illustrated in . A basic multiple input multiple output MIMO system is used for simplicity in illustrating the basic hardware transmission components but the components can also be adapted for a complex MIMO system a single input and single output SISO system or similar system. For example in a MIMO system at the transmitter binary input data can be protected through encoding using a channel encoder interleaved against fading phenomenon using an interleaver and mapped to improve reliability using a mapper . The mapped data can be separated into layers for antenna ports by a transmitter TX beamformer and the layers can be OFDM modulated into OFDM symbols using modulators A B. The modulators can use an inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform IDFT to generate modulated signals vector x for each antenna port . The modulated signals can be converted to analog signals with digital to analog converters DACs A B. The analog signals can be transmitted via radio frequency RF transmitters Txs A B configured to send the signal to transmitter antennas A B operable to communicate the signal. The analog signals will follow a path referred to as a channel. The analog signals travelling through that path can be referred to as a channel signal . The physical layer can include other components not shown such as series to parallel S P converters parallel to serial P S converters cyclic prefix CP inserters and deleters guardband inserters and deleters and other desired components.

The transmitted channel signal can be subject to noise and interference . The interference can include intra cell interference and intercell interference. Intra cell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted within the cell of the transmitter . Intercell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted by neighboring cells. The noise and interference is represented as an addition to the channel signal which can be received by receiver antennas A B and one or more radio frequency RF receivers Rxs A B at the receiver . The channel signal combined with the noise and interference can be converted to a digital modulated signal with analog to digital converters ADCs A B. The digital signal can be OFDM demodulated using demodulators A B. The demodulators can use a fast Fourier transform FFT algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform DFT to generate demodulated signals vector y for each antenna port . A channel estimator can use the demodulated signal to estimate the channel and the noise and interference that occurs in the channel. The channel estimator can include a feedback generator or be in communication with the feedback generator which can generate a physical uplink shared channel PUSCH feedback report such as a channel quality indicator CQI report a precoding matrix indicator PMI report or a transmission rank indicator RI report. The CQI can be used to assist the MIMO transmissions modes. The demodulated signals can be combined using a MIMO decoder demapped using a demapper deinterleaved using a deinterleaver and decoded by a channel decoder to generate binary output data that can be used by other layers of the receiving station.

In one example the resource elements REs can represent elements of a radio frame structure transmitted on the physical PHY layer in a downlink transmission between a node e.g. eNodeB and the wireless device e.g. UE using a generic 3GPP long term evolution LTE frame structure as illustrated in .

Each slot for a component carrier CC used by the node and the wireless device can include multiple resource blocks RBs and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. The CC can have a carrier frequency having a bandwidth and center frequency. Each subframe of the CC can include downlink control information DCI found in the legacy PDCCH. The legacy PDCCH in the control region can include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or physical RB PRB when a legacy PDCCH is used. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols or 14 OFDM symbols when legacy PDCCH is not used in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data for short or normal cyclic prefix .

The control region can include physical control format indicator channel PCFICH physical hybrid automatic repeat request hybrid ARQ indicator channel PHICH and the PDCCH. The control region has a flexible control design to avoid unnecessary overhead. The number of OFDM symbols in the control region used for the PDCCH can be determined by the control channel format indicator CFI transmitted in the physical control format indicator channel PCFICH . The PCFICH can be located in the first OFDM symbol of each subframe. The PCFICH and PHICH can have priority over the PDCCH so the PCFICH and PHICH are scheduled prior to the PDCCH.

Each RB physical RB or PRB can include 12 15 kHz subcarriers on the frequency axis and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM symbols on the time axis per slot. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements REs using short or normal cyclic prefixing or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs not shown using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol by one subcarrier i.e. 15 kHz .

Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase shift keying QPSK modulation. Other types of modulation may be used such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation QAM or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE or bi phase shift keying BPSK modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits a single bit in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.

A MIMO wireless network can be used for beamforming. Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in antenna arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. Beamforming can be achieved by combining elements in a phased array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. Beamforming can be used at both the transmitting and receiving ends in order to achieve spatial selectivity.

A way to increase the spectral efficiency SE in the wireless network e.g. cellular systems is utilizing a large number of antennas that employed at a base station or node e.g. eNB . Massive MIMO can refer a number of antennas in the large antenna array exceeding eight 8 antennas such as 16 32 or 64 antennas. Spectral efficiency SE spectrum efficiency or bandwidth efficiency refers to the information rate that can be transmitted over a given bandwidth in a specific communication system. SE can be a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized by the physical layer protocol and sometimes by the media access control the channel access protocol .

Dirty paper coding DPC can be an optimal data transmission scheme for a MIMO broadcast channel. Although DPC can maximize the rate and achieve Shannon capacity the implementation can have a high degree of complexity. DPC is a technique for efficient transmission of digital data through a channel subjected to some interference known to the transmitter. The technique can consist of precoding the data in order to cancel the effect caused by the interference. Dirty paper coding can achieve a channel capacity without a power penalty and without requiring a receiver to gain knowledge of the interference state. Channel capacity is the tightest upper bound on the rate of information that can be reliably transmitted over a communications channel. By a noisy channel coding theorem the channel capacity of a given channel is the limiting information rate in units of information per unit time that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability. Information theory or Shannon capacity defines the notion of channel capacity and provides a mathematical model by which channel capacity can be computed. A result of Shannon capacity states that the capacity of the channel can be given by a maximum of the mutual information between an input and an output of the channel where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution.

Precoding can be a generalization of beamforming to support multi stream or multi layer transmission in multi antenna wireless communications. For example in single stream beamforming a same signal can be emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate weighting e.g. phase and gain such that the signal power can be maximized at a receiver output. When a receiver has multiple antennas single stream beamforming may not simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas. To maximize the throughput in multiple receive antenna systems multi stream transmission can be used which can be provided by precoding.

Several suboptimal linear precoding schemes have been proposed. Although for a fixed number of users the rates resulting from various suboptimal linear precoding schemes may be less than the channel capacity linear precoding schemes can achieve channel capacity asymptotically i.e. when a number of users goes to infinity . Two linear precoding schemes include zero forcing beamforming ZFBF and random beamforming RBF .

With ZFBF a beam used for data transmission to one user e.g. UE can be designed in such a way that the beam lies in the null space of the space formed by the other users channel vectors. For example in a cell consisting of K users if vis the vector used to serve user k and his the channel to any other user i vand hcan be orthogonal i.e. v h . The beamforming vectors vcan be calculated at the base station eNB by forming channel matrix whose columns are channel vectors h h . . . h taking the inverse of channel matrix and normalizing the columns of the resulting matrix. As a result. ZFBF can remove or cancel inter user intra cell interference when the channel information for all the users in the cell is known at the node e.g. eNB . However in practical cellular systems some interference may remain because the channel information at the node e.g. eNB may not be perfect. The imprecise channel information can be due to the channel estimation at the user based on the reference signal and then quantized to be sent to the base station. Both the channel estimation and the quantization processes can introduce some error to the channel information. Moreover another difficulty in ZFBF can be user selection and pairing which can introduce complexity when the number of active users in the cell is large.

Quantization is the process of mapping a large set of input values to a smaller set such as rounding values to some unit of precision. A device or algorithmic function that performs quantization is called a quantizer. The round off error introduced by quantization is referred to as quantization error. For example an optimal beam may be quantized to a discrete index of the optimal beam such as a precoding matrix indicator PMI . In another example a signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR for the optimal beam may be quantized to a discrete SINR value such as a channel quality indicator CQI .

The PMI can be a signal fed back by the UE to support a multiple input multiple output MIMO operation. The PMI can correspond to an index of the precoder within a codebook shared by the UE and eNodeB which can maximize an aggregate number of data bits which can be received across all downlink spatial transmission layers. The CQI can be signaled by a UE to the eNodeB to indicate a suitable data rate such as a modulation and coding scheme MCS value for downlink transmissions which can be based on a measurement of the received downlink signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR and knowledge of the UE s receiver characteristics. A signal to noise and interference ratio SINR or signal to interference ratio S I or SIR also known as the carrier to interference ratio C I CIR refers to the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power S or C and the average received co channel interference power I i.e. cross talk from other transmitters than the useful signal .

Another approach for linear precoding is random beamforming RBF . In RBF each user e.g. UE can calculate an optimal beam among a set of orthogonal beams by maximizing the optimal beam s received SINR and report an index of the optimal beam e.g. PMI along with the optimal SINR e.g. CQI . The node can then select one user per beam based on the SINR values and serve those users with the beams the users requested. As a result user selection and scheduling process at the node can be simplified over other linear precoding schemes. Furthermore a beamforming vector calculation may not be needed at the node. Moreover because the same beam can be used for an SINR calculation by the user and data transmission at the node reduced to no mismatch may occur between reference signals used in the SINR calculation and data transmission for RBF. However inter user intra cell interference may not be cancelled using RBF e.g. unlike ZFBF because the beam for one user may not be orthogonal to a channel of other users. In addition as users assume that the other beams can be used in data transmission phase the calculated SINRs e.g. CQIs based on RBF can be considered pessimistic. Conversely the calculated SINRs e.g. CQIs based on ZFBF can be considered optimistic especially relative to RBF . In an example a pessimistic SINR can provide a lower bound on the SINR and an optimistic SINR can provide an upper bound on the SINR.

In an example a wireless system can use adaptive technology or hybrid ZFBF and RBF technology using both ZFBF and RBF which can be used to improve system performance. The adaptive technology or hybrid ZFBF and RBF technology can include methods computer circuitry systems user equipments UEs or nodes e.g. eNB .

In a simple RBF example each UE can calculate its optimal channel direction PMI using a codebook known to both the eNB and the UE. Moreover each UE can estimate a downlink SINR by assuming that the signal transmitted to the UE is beamformed by a reported PMI direction to the eNB from the UE and by assuming that other UEs are each served on one of the other beam directions codewords e.g. one UE served by one other beam . For example each UE k can first obtain an estimated channel from the received reference signals e.g. pilots and then multiple downlink SINRs may be calculated at the UE assuming that the UE is served by beam and other UEs in the cell are served by other beams i n which can be represented as Expression 1.

Consequently optimal SINR CQI can be represented by Expression 2 and the PMI is the index of which maximizes INRover n.

For expressions 1 and 2 the beams can be assumed not to be reused in the neighboring interfering cells. The UEs in the cell can send a PMI and an optimal SINR e.g. CQI information to the eNB. The PMI can be associated with the CQI. The eNB can then select in each beam the UE with highest SINR and therefore the effective downlink SINR for UE k can be represented by Expression 3.

In a simple ZFBF example each UE k can estimate its channel from downlink reference signals pilots first similar to RBF described above . Then the UE can estimate multiple downlink SINRs assuming different beams can be used for data transmission. With ZFBF the UE may not know a final beamforming decision at the eNB the UE may only calculate single user SU SINRs as represented by Expression 4.

Consequently optimal SINR CQI can be represented by Expression 5 and PMI is the index of which maximizes INRover n.

Next in a data transmission the eNB can perform user selection and pairing and calculate beams such that v vand are orthogonal for all i k. For ZFBF the effective downlink SINR for UE k can be represented by Expression 6.

As previously discussed one benefit of RBF relative to ZFBF is that RBF can have lower complexity in terms of user selection scheduling and beamforming calculation at the eNB. Furthermore RBF CQI can be calculated by the UE based on a multi user MU assumption e.g. expression 1 and RBF may not have a SINR mismatch other than channel mismatch when all the beams are used and one UE per beam is served e.g. total of N UEs as can be seen from expression 3. On the other hand the ZFBF CQI calculation can be based on a single user SU e.g. expression 4 and as a result some interference mismatch in addition to the channel mismatch can occur as can be observed in expression 6.

However RBF can have a low data rate per UE as the calculated SINR at each UE assumes N 1 other UEs are served in the same resource which can result in a large interference power in the denominator of SINR expression 1 . In some cases larger SINRs and throughputs may be achievable by serving fewer UEs as serving fewer UEs can reduce the interference in the system.

Therefore depending on an amount of overhead and system complexity several hybrid ZFBF RBF schemes can be used.

In an example alternative 1 a UE can feed back PMI along with either a CQI CQI assuming RBF or a CQI CQI assuming ZFBF . illustrates alternative 1 where UEs can be divided into two groups by the eNB based on the UE s channel condition average throughput or other similar criteria. In an example the grouping can be signaled to the UE through downlink control channel e.g. RBF group feedback and ZFBF group feedback . UEs e.g. UE in a first group e.g. RBF group can feedback PMI and CQI Expressions 7 and 8 and UEs e.g. UE in a second group e.g. ZFBF group can feedback PMI and CQI 266 Expressions 7 and 9 where 

The eNB then has two options In a first option for alternative 1 the eNB can select RBF group and serves the UEs e.g. UE in the RBF group by using RBF. In a second option for alternative 1 the eNB can select a subset of UEs e.g. UE in the ZFBF group e.g. by greedy user selection and proportional fairness scheduling PFS and serve the UEusing ZFBF.

Among options 1 and 2 for alternative 1 the eNB can choose an optimal linear precoding scheme depending on an objective function or criteria such as maximizing overall throughput maximizing per user throughput or minimizing delay. Contrary to simple RBF in the first option mismatch can occur if the number of UEs in RBF group is less than number of beams N. The number of dropped packets or error messages may determine if RBF or ZFBF is used.

Proportional fairness is a compromise based scheduling algorithm which is based upon maintaining a balance between two competing interests Trying to maximize total wireless network throughput while at the same time allowing all users at least a minimal level of service. Greedy user selection or greedy opportunistic scheduling can provide scheduling for the UEs that can provide a higher throughput which can lead to a severe transmission starvation issue for UEs with poor SINR or data throughput .

In an example alternative 2 a UE can feed back PMI along with both a CQI CQI assuming RBF and a CQI CQI assuming ZFBF Expressions 10 12 . In alternative 2 the UEs can feedback PMI CQIand CQI .

The eNB has two options for data transmission In a first option the eNB can consider PMI and CQIand apply RBF and serve one UE per beam. In a second option the eNB can consider PMI and CQI select users based on some criteria e.g. greedy and proportional fairness scheduling and perform ZFBF. Among options 1 and 2 for alternative 2 the eNB can choose an optimal one depending on some objective function and criteria such as maximizing overall throughput maximizing per user throughput or minimizing delay.

In an example alternative 3 a UE can feed back PMIalong with a CQI CQI assuming RBF and optionally feed back PMIalong with a CQI CQI assuming ZFBF . illustrates beam angles of a fine codebook relative to a course codebook . illustrates alternative 3 where each UE uses a low density codebook e.g. course codebook and calculates and feeds back PMI CQI Expressions 13 and 14 . For alternative 3 the eNB can uses the course feedback information from the UEs and serve N UEs using RBF for data transmission. Depending on the environment and system criteria the eNB can ask the UEs to use a high density codebook e.g. fine codebook and the UEs can send PMIand CQI Expressions 15 and 16 . In alternative 3 the eNB can subsequently perform ZFBF for data transmission after initially performing RBF using the course codebook for data transmission.

Depending on the system design in alternative 3 UEs can either send PMIand CQIor use differential coding and signal the PMI PMI PMIand CQI CQI CQI. Thus a fine quantization can use a static fine codebook or a differential codebook based on the coarse quantization.

In an example alternative 4 a UE can feed back PMIalong with both a CQI CQI assuming RBF and a CQI CQI assuming ZFBF and optionally feed back PMIalong with both a CQI CQI assuming RBF and a CQI CQI assuming ZFBF . illustrates alternative 4 where each UE uses a low density codebook e.g. course codebook and calculates and feeds back PMI CQI and CQI Expressions 17 19 . For alternative 4 the eNB can uses the course feedback information from the UEs and serve N UEs using RBF or ZFBF for data transmission. Depending on the environment and system criteria the eNB can ask the UEs to use a high density codebook e.g. fine codebook and the UEs can feed back PMI CQI and CQI Expressions 20 22 . In alternative 4 the eNB can subsequently perform RBF or ZFBF using a fine codebook for data transmission after initially performing RBF or ZFBF using the course codebook for data transmission. Alternative 4 is similar to alternative 3 with some additional feedback as shown in .

Depending on the system design in alternative 4 UEs can either send PMI CQI and CQIor use differential coding and signal the PMI PMI PMI CQI CQI CQI and CQI CQI CQI. Thus a fine quantization can use a static fine codebook or a differential codebook based on the coarse quantization.

Each UE can use the low density codebook e.g. course codebook as illustrated in and calculate and feed back PMI CQI and CQI. With alternative 4 eNB has two options for data transmission and can select an optimal one based on the feedback. In option 1 for alternative 4 the eNB can consider PMIand CQIand apply RBF and serve one UE per beam. In option 2 for alternative 4 the eNB can consider PMIand CQI select UEs based on some criteria e.g. greedy and proportional fairness scheduling and perform ZFBF.

Depending on the environment and system criteria the eNB can request UEs to use a high density codebook e.g. fine codebook and the UEs can feed back PMI CQI and CQI. For alternative 4 the eNB again has two options for data transmission and can choose an optimal one based on the feedback. In option 3 for alternative 4 the eNB can consider PMIand CQIand apply RBF and serve one UE per beam. In option 4 for alternative 4 the eNB can consider PMIand CQI select UEs based on some criteria e.g. greedy and proportional fairness scheduling and perform ZFBF.

Selecting between alternatives 1 4 can depend on system requirements and balancing between overhead and throughput. The feedback from PMIs and CQIs of alternatives 1 4 can add additional overhead where alternative 4 has the greatest amount of feedback and overhead of the alternatives and alternative 1 has the least amount of feedback and overhead of the alternatives. Due to the lower overhead of alternative 1 alternative 1 may have a greater data transmission throughput relative to the other alternatives.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a processor on a user equipment UE operable to provide hybrid beamforming feedback as shown in the flow chart in .

Another example provides a method for receiving random beamforming RBF feedback and zero forcing beamforming ZFBF feedback at a node as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine computer circuitry or a processor for the node e.g. eNB where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The method includes the operation of receiving an optimal channel direction from a user equipment UE as in block . The operation of receiving an optimal signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR for the optimal channel direction wherein the node is configured to conditionally receive the optimal SINR calculated with an intra cell interference component or receive the optimal SINR calculated without an intra cell interference component based on a feedback configuration follows as in block .

In an example the method can further include transmitting a reference signal RS to the UE wherein the optimal channel direction and the optimal SINR is determined from the RS. In another example the method can further include Selecting a RBF UE for a RBF group based on a criteria and selecting a ZFBF UE for a ZFBF group based on the criteria. The criteria can improve a channel condition maximize overall throughput maximize per user throughput or minimize delay. The operation of linear precoding transmissions can further include Linear precoding transmissions of the RBF UE in the RBF group using the RBF precoding and linear precoding transmissions of the ZFBF UE in the ZFBF group using the ZFBF precoding.

In another configuration the operation of receiving the optimal SINR for the optimal channel direction can further include receiving both a pessimistic channel quality indicator CQI representing the optimal SINR calculated with the intra cell interference component and an optimistic CQI representing the optimal SINR calculated without the intra cell interference component.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes compact disc read only memory CD ROMs hard drives non transitory computer readable storage medium or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. Circuitry can include hardware firmware program code executable code computer instructions and or software. A non transitory computer readable storage medium can be a computer readable storage medium that does not include signal. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device may include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. The volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements may be a random access memory RAM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM flash drive optical drive magnetic hard drive solid state drive or other medium for storing electronic data. The node and wireless device may also include a transceiver module i.e. transceiver a counter module i.e. counter a processing module i.e. processor and or a clock module i.e. clock or timer module i.e. timer . One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface API reusable controls and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s may be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very large scale integration VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.
