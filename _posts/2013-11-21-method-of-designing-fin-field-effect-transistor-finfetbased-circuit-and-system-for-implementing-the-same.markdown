Circuit designers receive circuit performance requirements from a customer and design circuits capable of satisfying the performance requirements. Circuits are designed using computer programs which help the circuit designers simulate a performance of the designed circuits.

During design of a circuit resistance and capacitance between neighboring devices and conductive elements are taken into account in order to more accurately predict a performance of the circuit. As node sizes decrease spacing between the neighboring devices and conductive elements also decreases which increases an impact of resistance and capacitance on performance of the circuit.

For circuits based on fin field effect transistor FinFET devices circuit designers create two separate schematics. One schematic includes artificial elements which are not part of the actual circuit design. These artificial elements are used to help account for the resistance and capacitance between the neighboring devices and connections. Another schematic does not include the artificial elements and is used to help arrange devices within the circuit. The two schematics are refined using an iterative process which includes making modifications to both schematics to remove discrepancies between the schematics and satisfy the performance requirements.

The following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are examples and are not intended to be limiting.

A macro FinFET library is combined with the schematic design from operation in order to account for resistance and capacitance effects of elements within each FinFET device and connections in the FinFET based circuit. Macro FinFET library is stored in a non transitory computer readable medium. Macro FinFET library includes a parameter cell p cell symbol for both a pre layout simulation and a layout versus schematic LVS simulation. Macro FinFET library also includes a component description format CDF for each FinFET device. Macro FinFET library includes simulated values for resistance and capacitance called RC bin values. In some embodiments the RC bin values are determined using a commercial RC extraction tool. Based on modifications to the FinFET device and resulting RC bin values the artificial elements are designed to simulate the resistance and capacitance effects of the FinFET device. Macro FinFET library is configured to store these artificial elements in combination with a specific FinFET device design i.e. a specific dimension a number of fingers and other suitable artificial elements. In some embodiments the artificial elements include polysilicon oxide diffusion edge PODE devices middle end of line MEOL connections back end of line BEOL connections or other suitable RC devices which simulate RC effects within a FinFET device.

In operation a schematic design which includes macro FinFET parameters is developed. By combining macro FinFET library with the schematic design from operation FinFET devices within the schematic diagram are modified to include the artificial elements which help to simulate the RC performance of the FinFET devices. The macro FinFET parameters enable a more accurate simulation of performance of the circuit in comparison with the schematic design from operation due to the inclusion of the artificial elements.

A pre layout simulation is performed in operation . The pre layout simulation generates electrical characteristics or functional characteristics which are used to compare a performance of the schematic design with the performance specification from the customer. In some embodiments the pre layout simulation includes comparing I V curves or current gains between the schematic design and the performance specification. In some embodiments the pre layout simulation includes simulating an output of the schematic design in response to a simulated input. The output is then compared against the performance specification.

Following the pre layout simulation if the results pre layout simulation satisfy the performance specification method continues to operation . If the results of the pre layout simulation do not satisfy the performance specification method returns to operation and the schematic design is revised.

In operation a layout is generated. The layout is a physical location of the devices and connections in the schematic design. The layout does not include the artificial elements used to simulate the RC performance in pre layout simulation. In some embodiments the layout is generated using a graphic database system GDS . In some embodiments the layout includes multiple layers. In some embodiments generating the layout includes designing masks which are used to pattern a wafer to form the circuit. In some embodiments a number of masks is equal to a number of layers in the layout. In some embodiments more than one mask is used to form at least one layer of the layout. In some embodiments the layout is stored on a non transitory computer readable medium. In some embodiments the layout is generated using a tool such as VIRTUOSO available from CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS Inc. or another suitable layout generating tool. In some embodiments the layout is generated based on a netlist which is created based on the schematic design.

In some embodiments the netlist includes materials and dimensions of the various devices and connections in the schematic design. For example a netlist describing a transistor includes a gate width a gate length a location of terminals of the transistor a number of fingers or other suitable parameters used to describe the transistor.

In some embodiments a design rule check DRC is performed during generation of the layout. The DRC is used to maintain sufficient spacing between features in the layout so that the layout can be precisely formed during a fabrication process. In some embodiments a same tool used to generate the layout is used to perform the DRC. In some embodiments the DRC is performed by a separate tool following generation of the layout.

In operation an LVS check is performed. The LVS check compares the layout with the schematic design to help ensure the layout accurately represents the circuit as designed by the circuit designer. The LVS check does not account for the artificial elements in the schematic design. In some embodiments the LVS check includes extracting a layout netlist from the layout design. The extracted layout netlist does not include the artificial elements. In some embodiments the extracted layout netlist includes nodes corresponding to the device e.g. a gate G a drain D a source S and a bulk B for a transistor. In some embodiments the extracted layout netlist is compared with the schematic design to determine whether the layout matches the schematic design.

In operation an RC extraction is performed. In some embodiments the RC extraction extracts electrical performance information from the layout. In some embodiments the RC extraction is performed based on the extracted layout netlist. In some embodiments the RC extraction applies the extracted information to various device models to determine the electrical characteristics of the layout generated in operation . The RC extraction accounts for both the active devices and interconnect structures used to connect various active devices together. In some embodiments a layout parasitic extraction LPE is performed in combination with the RC extraction. The LPE extracts information about the active devices from the layout instead of relying on a netlist.

A post layout simulation is performed in operation . The post layout simulation determines the performance of the circuit in the layout of operation and compares the performance with the performance specification received from the customer. In some embodiments the post layout simulation is performed using a post layout simulator such as HSPICE available from SYNOPSYS Inc. SPECTRE available from CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS Inc. or other suitable post simulation tools.

If the post layout simulation determines that the layout satisfies the performance specification the layout is transferred to the production stage to begin fabrication of masks used to create the layout. If the post layout simulation determines that the layout does not satisfy the performance specification at least one of the layout or the schematic design is revised to address the failure to satisfy the performance specification.

Using method helps to reduce time and resources during designing of a FinFET based circuit in comparison with methods which do not include the macro FinFET parameters. Instead of developing two separate schematic designs the circuit designer develops a single schematic design and macro FinFET library is used to modify the schematic design to take into consideration the artificial elements to help simulate RC performance of the circuit. Macro FinFET library allows switching between the p cell schematic which include the artificial elements in order to facilitate RC extraction and a p cell schematic free of the artificial elements for layout generation and evaluation. The ability to easily switch between different p cell schematics helps to avoid a circuit designer inadvertently leaving a schematic design in a parasitic mode. Leaving a design in the parasitic mode during the post layout simulation would result in considering the parasitic RC values of the artificial elements twice which would reduce the accuracy of simulation.

CDF includes a structure for each FinFET device. In some embodiments the structure includes both an inherit PDK FinFET device and the macro FinFET information which includes the artificial elements.

P cell symbol includes both an icon for a parasitic mode and an icon for a layout mode. P cell symbol enables the circuit designer to easily identify whether the schematic design is in the parasitic mode or in the layout mode.

P cell schematic includes a schematic design for both the parasitic mode and the layout mode. The parasitic mode p cell schematic includes the artificial elements such as PODE MEOL BEOL or other parasitic elements. The layout mode p cell schematic is free of the artificial elements.

RC bin values are determined using a simulation tool in combination with different configurations of the FinFET device. The different configurations include different dimensions or different materials for the FinFET device. These different configurations create different parasitic effects in the FinFET device. These different parasitic effects are stored in macro FinFET library for use in method .

RC equivalent equations are determined based on RC bin values . RC equivalent equations are used to determine the parasitic performance of the FinFET device. In some embodiment RC equivalent equations are linear. In some embodiments RC equivalent equations are non linear. In some embodiments RC equivalent equations are used to interpolate between different RC bin values .

PODEs are similar to dummy gate structures and are used to help simulate the actual performance of transistor during operation. FinFET includes two PODEs . In some embodiments more or less than two PODEs are included in FinFET . PODEs are not actually part of transistor but are used to simulate actual performance of the transistor.

Resistors and capacitors reflect the performance of signals propagating through connections in FinFET . Resistors and capacitors are not formed in the connections of FinFET but help to simulate the actual speed of propagation voltage level and current level of signals propagating through the connections of the FinFET.

Method allows a circuit designer to easily switch between FinFET and FinFET to enable both electrical performance simulation and layout generation. The ability to easily switch between the different p cell schematics enables the use of a single schematic design to save time and resources during circuit design. The ability to easily switch between the p cell schematics also helps to reduce a number of iterations used during refining of the circuit design to satisfy the performance specification provided by the customer.

A PDK library is plugged in by a macro FinFET application programming interface API and is combined with the schematic design in order to account for resistance and capacitance effects of elements within each FinFET device in the FinFET based circuit. PDK library is stored on a non transitory computer readable medium. PDK library includes native structures and connections of each FinFET device. PDK library also includes a netlist wrapper. The netlist wrapper is used to control whether an intrinsic PDK netlist procedure or a macro FinFET netlist procedure is used to evaluate the FinFET device at each stage of method . A CDF is also part of PDK library . The CDF is adjustable based on modifications provided from macro FinFET API .

Macro FinFET API is stored on a non transitory computer readable medium. A netlist procedure in macro FinFET API is used to plug in the netlist wrapper from PDK library to include artificial elements such as PODE and resistance and capacitance elements of the MEOL and BEOL connections.

A model card includes information related to nodes electrically coupled to the FinFET device. In some embodiments the model card further includes parasitic information related to the FinFET device. In some embodiments macro FinFET API is capable of plugging in PDK library provided from an external source.

In contrast with macro FinFET library the combination of PDK library and macro FinFET API are directed to plugging in the netlist wrapper stored in the PDK library. By plugging in the netlist wrapper of PDK library the net list wrapper in PDK library includes both the artificial elements and an intrinsic PDK netlist which only includes elements which are actually formed during fabrication of the circuit. Plugging in the netlist wrapper of PDK library also updates an RC mapping table stored in the PDK library. The updated RC mapping table enables accurate RC extraction and simulation of the FinFET device without requiring the circuit designer to switch between a parasitic mode and an intrinsic PDK netlist procedure mode.

In operation a schematic design which includes macro FinFET parameters is developed. By combining PDK library and macro FinFET API with the schematic design from operation FinFET devices within the schematic diagram are modified to include the artificial elements which help to simulate the RC performance of the FinFET devices.

Following the pre layout simulation if the results pre layout simulation satisfy the performance specification method continues to operation . If the results of the pre layout simulation do not satisfy the performance specification method returns to operation and the schematic design is revised.

In operation a layout is generated. The layout is a physical location of the devices and connections in the schematic design.

In some embodiments the layout is stored on a non transitory computer readable medium. In some embodiments the layout is generated using a tool such as VIRTUOSO available from CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS Inc. or another suitable layout generating tool. In some embodiments the layout is generated based on the netlist wrapper from PDK library without the modifications from the netlist procedure from macro FinFET API.

In some embodiments a DRC is performed during generation of the layout to maintain sufficient spacing between features in the layout so that the layout can be precisely formed during a fabrication process. In some embodiments a same tool used to generate the layout is used to perform the DRC. In some embodiments the DRC is performed by a separate tool following generation of the layout.

In operation an LVS check is performed. The LVS check compares the layout with the schematic design to help ensure the layout accurately represents the circuit as designed by the circuit designer.

In some embodiments the RC extraction applies the extracted information to various device models to determine the electrical characteristics of the layout generated in operation . The RC extraction accounts for both the active devices and interconnect structures used to connect various active devices together. In some embodiments a LPE is performed in combination with the RC extraction.

A post layout simulation is performed in operation . The post layout simulation determines the performance of the circuit in the layout of operation and compares the performance with the performance specification received from the customer. In some embodiments the post layout simulation is performed using a post layout simulator such as HSPICE available from SYNOPSYS Inc. SPECTRE available from CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS Inc. or other suitable post simulation tools.

If the post layout simulation determines that the layout satisfies the performance specification the layout is transferred to the production stage to begin fabrication of masks used to create the layout. If the post layout simulation determines that the layout does not satisfy the performance specification at least one of the layout or the schematic design is revised to address the failure to satisfy the performance specification.

Similar to method method helps to reduce time and resources during designing of a FinFET based circuit in comparison with methods which do not include the macro FinFET parameters. Instead of developing two separate schematic designs the circuit designer develops a single schematic and a combination of PDK library and macro FinFET API are used to add the artificial elements to help simulate RC performance of the circuit. A PDK Library Netlist Wrapper allows switching between a netlist which includes the artificial elements in order to facilitate RC extraction and a netlist free of the artificial elements for an intrinsic pre layout evaluation. A benefit of method is that the method produces an accurate layout even if designers leave the schematic design in linking with macro FinFET API to have the artificial elements or in adopting an intrinsic PDK elements without the artificial elements to automatically prevent from double counting parasitic RC values twice at RC extraction stage by using RC Mapping Table inside PDK library .

Macro FinFET API includes a netlist procedure used to plug in to netlist wrapper to include the artificial elements during RC performance simulation of the FinFET device. RC bin values stored in macro FinFET API are determined using a simulation tool in combination with different configurations of the FinFET device.

In some embodiments the pre layout simulation includes comparing I V curves or current gains between the schematic design and the performance specification. In some embodiments the pre layout simulation includes simulating an output of the schematic design in response to a simulated input. The output is then compared against the performance specification.

In contrast with the combination of PDK library and macro FinFET API constraint API and macro FinFET API are applied only during pre layout simulation to modify the artificial elements using the EDA tool. A benefit of method is that double counting of RC components is avoided by limiting the use of the artificial elements to the pre layout simulation. In some embodiments constraint API and macro FinFET API do not modify a netlist within the PDK FinFET device.

Following the pre layout simulation if the results pre layout simulation satisfy the performance specification method continues to operation . If the results of the pre layout simulation do not satisfy the performance specification method returns to operation and the schematic design is revised.

If the post layout simulation determines that the layout satisfies the performance specification the layout is transferred to the production stage to begin fabrication of masks used to create the layout. If the post layout simulation determines that the layout does not satisfy the performance specification at least one of the layout or the schematic design is revised to address the failure to satisfy the performance specification.

Similar to method method helps to reduce time and resources during designing of a FinFET based circuit in comparison with methods which do not include the macro FinFET parameters. Instead of developing two separate schematic designs the circuit designer develops a single schematic and a combination of constrained PDK library and macro FinFET API are used to add the artificial elements to help simulate RC performance of the circuit using the EDA tool. The constrained PDK library allows inclusion of macro FinFET API during a pre layout simulation in order to facilitate precise electrical performance simulation but does not include the macro FinFET API information during layout generation and evaluation. The limited use of macro FinFET API information helps to avoid a circuit designer inadvertently considering artificial elements during layout generation or evaluation to reduce the risk of considering the parasitic RC values twice which would reduce the accuracy of simulation.
