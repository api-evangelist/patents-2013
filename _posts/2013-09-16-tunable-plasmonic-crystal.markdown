title: Tunable plasmonic crystal
abstract: A tunable plasmonic crystal comprises several periods in a two-dimensional electron or hole gas plasmonic medium that is both extremely subwavelength (˜λ/100) and tunable through the application of voltages to metal electrodes. Tuning of the plasmonic crystal band edges can be realized in materials such as semiconductors and graphene to actively control the plasmonic crystal dispersion in the terahertz and infrared spectral regions. The tunable plasmonic crystal provides a useful degree of freedom for applications in slow light devices, voltage-tunable waveguides, filters, ultra-sensitive direct and heterodyne THz detectors, and THz oscillators.

This invention was made with Government support under contract no. DE AC04 94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to photonic band gap structures and in particular to a tunable plasmonic crystal.

Photonic band gaps strong light matter interaction slow light and negative refractive index arise in photonic crystal structures due to Bragg scattering of electromagnetic waves from a repeated unit cell. See E. Yablonovitch et al. 67 2295 1991 T. Yoshie et al. 432 200 2004 T. Baba 2 465 2008 A. Berrier et al. 93 073902 2004 E. Yablonovitch 58 2059 1987 and S. John 58 2486 1987 . However the electromagnetic properties of photonic crystals engineered from bulk semiconductors metals and dielectrics generally are weakly tunable if at all. Material systems such two dimensional electron gases 2DEGs embedded in semiconductors and graphene offer a substantially more flexible electromagnetic medium. See S. J. Allen et al. 38 980 1977 M. I. Dyakonov and M. S. Shur 43 380 1996 L. Ju et al. 6 630 2011 H. Yan et al. 7 330 2012 and A. N. Grigorenko et al. 6 749 2012 . These plasmonic materials can both be lithographically patterned and electronically tuned giving rise to a variety of subwavelength plasmonic devices that may be broadly controlled via an applied DC electric field. When a periodic structure is engineered from these systems a plasmonic band structure can be realized. See U. Mackens et al. 53 1485 1984 V. M. Muravev et al. 101 216801 2008 G. C. Dyer et al. 109 126803 2012 and W. F. Andress et al. 12 2272 2012 .

However a need remains for a tunable plasmonic band structure i.e. a tunable plasmonic crystal. The present invention provides widely tunable plasmonic band gap structures using a two dimensional electron or hole gas in semiconductors or graphene.

The present invention is directed to a tunable plasmonic crystal comprising a layer providing a two dimensional electron gas 2DEG or a two dimensional hole gas 2DHG a periodic gate comprising at least two parallel finger electrodes disposed on the 2DEG or 2DHG layer and means for applying a gate voltage to the periodic gate to modulate the electron density in the 2DEG layer or the hole density in the 2DHG layer thereby producing a spatially periodic plasmon structure having a unit cell wherein the spatially periodic plasmon structure produces a plasmonic band structure when interacting with incident electromagnetic radiation and wherein the applied gate voltage is preferably sufficient to produce at least one bandgap in the plasmonic band structure. The layer providing the 2DEG or the 2DHG can be formed at a semiconductor heterojunction formed between two semiconductor materials having different band gaps such as GaAs AlGaAs InGaAs InAlAs GaN AlGaN or GaSb InAs or an atomically thin material having high electron mobility or high hole mobility such as graphene. The unit cell of the periodic plasmon structure is preferably less than 1 10 and more preferably less than 1 100 the free space wavelength of the incident electromagnetic radiation. The incident electromagnetic radiation can have a frequency of between 10 GHz and 60 THz i.e. free space wavelength of between 30 mm and 5 m . The incident electromagnetic radiation can be coupled to the tunable plasmonic crystal by an antenna or an on chip signal generator. The tunable plasmonic crystal can further comprise at least one finger electrode disposed on the 2DEG or 2DHG layer biased at a different voltage than the gate voltage thereby forming a plasmonic defect in the tunable plasmonic crystal.

Photonic crystals and metamaterials have emerged as two classes of tailorable materials that enable precise control of light. Plasmonic crystals which can be thought of as photonic crystals fabricated from plasmonic materials Bragg scatter incident electromagnetic waves from a repeated unit cell. However plasmonic crystals like metamaterials are composed of subwavelength unit cells. The present invention is directed to tunable plasmonic crystals of several periods in a two dimensional electron or hole gas. This plasmonic medium is both extremely subwavelength 100 and tunable through the application of voltages to metal electrodes. Weakly localized crystal surface states known as Tamm states are observed. By introducing an independently controlled plasmonic defect that interacts with the Tamm states a frequency agile electromagnetically induced transparency phenomenon can be achieved. In situ tuning of the plasmonic crystal band edges can be realized in materials such as semiconductors and graphene to actively control the plasmonic crystal dispersion in the terahertz and infrared spectral regions.

The band structure as well as coupled surface and defect states in exemplary tunable PC structures are described below. Both photonic crystals and strongly coupled resonators can be harnessed for slow light applications and tunable plasmonic systems provide a useful degree of freedom for possible slow light devices. See T. Baba 2 465 2008 B. Luk yanchuk et al. 9 707 2010 and K. Totsuka et al. 98 213904 2007 . More broadly plasmonic crystals can be integrated as voltage tunable waveguides and filters in photonic crystals. While the exemplary plasmonic devices based upon GaAs AlGaAs heterostructures can be limited in both operating temperature 

In is shown a side view schematic illustration of a tunable plasmonic crystal . The plasmonic crystal comprises a layer that provides a two dimensional electron gas 2DEG on a substrate . The 2DEG layer comprises a gas of electrons free to move in two dimensions but tightly confined in the third dimension. Alternatively the plasmonic crystal can comprise a multiple layer 2DEG or a two dimensional hole gas 2DHG . For example the 2DEG layer can comprise a semiconductor heterojunction or an atomically thin material having high electron mobility. The 2DEG mobility is preferably sufficiently large that the plasmon scattering rate is significantly smaller preferably by at least by a factor of ten than the 2DEG plasma frequency. The substrate preferably can form an atomically smooth 2DEG or 2DHG and has sufficiently low doping that the substrate bulk plasma frequency is much lower than the 2DEG plasma frequency. Therefore the semiconductor heterojunction is preferably grown on a semi insulating and atomically flat substrate. A periodic gate comprising two or more parallel finger electrodes are disposed on the 2DEG layer . The gate can be separated from the 2DEG layer by a semiconducting or insulating layer . The gate contacts form a Schottky barrier at the metal semiconductor interface. The gate width and spacing from the 2DEG strongly influence the 2D plasma frequency as will be described below. A voltage Vcan be applied to the periodic gate to spatially modulate the electron density in the 2DEG layer under each finger electrode . The voltage Vcan be varied to tune the charge density in the underlying 2DEG layer . The resulting spatially periodic plasmon structure can produce a plasmonic band structure having at least one bandgap. Electromagnetic radiation at frequency incident on the 2DEG layer can interact with the plasmonic band structure as described below. The incident radiation can have a frequency between about 10 GHz and 60 THz i.e. free space wavelength of between 30 mm and 5 m . The unit cell of the spatially periodic plasmon structure is preferably subwavelength e.g. less than 1 10 and more preferably deeply subwavelength e.g. less than 1 100 . The precise size of the unit cell typically on the order of several hundred nm to tens of m together with the 2DEG density typically in the range of 10to 10cm determines the frequencies of the allowed bands and band gaps as will be described more fully below. The plasmonic crystal can further comprise a means net shown to couple the incident electromagnetic radiation into the 2DEG layer such as an antenna not shown to scale to capture an external THz signal or an on chip THz signal generator e.g. a local oscillator or photoconductive switch . A mesa can be defined by chemical etching and ohmic contacts to ends of the 2DEG layer can be formed to provide a drain D and a source S. A response to the incident radiation can be measured as a photovoltaic response Vor a photoconductive response Ibetween the drain D and the source S. In is shown a schematic top view illustration of a tunable plasmonic crystal further comprising a finger electrode that can be biased at a voltage Vthat is different from the gate voltage V thereby providing a plasmonic defect.

The 2DEG can be formed at a heterojunction between two semiconductors having different bad gaps. The heterojunction can comprise a wide bandgap semiconductor heavily doped with an electron donor such as n type AlGaAs or n type AlGaN and an undoped narrow bandgap semiconductor such as GaAs or GaN. For example the heterojunction can be fabricated using molecular beam epitaxy. The heterojunction thereby forms a quantum well in the conduction band of the undoped semiconductor. Electrons from the n type semiconductor drop into the quantum well and can move with high mobility without colliding with impurities in the undoped semiconductor. A thin layer comprising highly mobile conducting electrons with very high concentration the 2DEG is thereby created at the heterojunction. Other III V heterojunctions can also be used including but not limited to GaAs AlGaAs InGaAs InAlAs and GaN AlGaN.

A quantum well formed in a narrow gap semiconductor placed between wide gap semiconductors with remote n type dopants can similarly provide a suitable 2DEG. Multiple quantum wells can also be employed as in the exemplary devices described below to increase the total 2DEG density through summation of the densities in adjacent wells. Choice of the type of heterojunction or quantum well can impact 2DEG mobility and density as well as the depth of the well relative to the surface or the epitaxial growth. The depth of the embedded 2DEG layer ultimately determines the strength of plasmon screening due to fabricated metal terminals. Finally type II heterojunctions such as those formed between InAs GaSb can produce either a 2DEG or a 2DHG which will differ greatly in majority carrier effective mass.

A 2DEG can also be formed in atomically thin materials having high electron mobility such as graphene. Graphene is a one atom thick layer of sp bonded carbon arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern. As such graphene can be considered as an indefinitely large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in which electrons are free to move by virtue of the spbonding. In particular graphene has been found to have remarkably high electron mobility at room temperature due to the low defect scattering of intrinsic graphene. Additionally a 2DHG having similar properties to the 2DEG but with positive carrier charge polarity can also be formed by chemical or electronic doping. Graphene is commonly procured by exfoliation or grown using chemical vapor deposition on a substrate such as copper. Graphene flakes or sheets can be transferred to a substrate such as silicon silicon dioxide silicon carbide quartz or boron nitride allowing patterning by utilizing photo or electron lithography and chemical or plasma etching techniques.

As an example of the present invention subwavelength plasmonic media that utilize a 2DEG formed at a GaAs AlGaAs interface is described below. Exemplary devices were fabricated using standard contact lithography metallization deposition and lift off techniques from a GaAs AlGaAs double quantum well heterostructure with total 2DEG density 4.02 10cmat 12 K. The 2DEG was embedded a distance d 386 nm below the surface of the MBE grown heterostructure. The periodic gates were designed to have a 4.0 m period with 50 metallization duty cycle but the fabricated dimension differed slightly yielding a 3.8 m period with approximately 60 metalization duty cycle of the 10 m wide mesa. The THz radiation was generated with a microwave frequency multiplication chain and optically coupled through z cut quartz windows in a closed cycle cryogenic system. Photoresponse and transport measurements were performed at 75 Hz modulation rate using a lock in amplifier to measure the voltage between source and drain terminals.

Similar to the q plasmon dispersion in graphene the 2DEG plasmon dispersion depends explicitly upon both the plasmon wavevector and the AC conductivity of the medium. An effective methodology to describe plasma excitations in a 2DEG is that of an LC plasmonic resonator. See P. J. Burke et al. 76 745 2000 . Here L is the field effect tunable kinetic inductance of the 2DEG. The 2DEG capacitance can be introduced as 2 1 where is the effective permittivity of the embedded 2DEG and q is the plasmon wavevector. See G. C. Dyer et al. 109 126803 2012 F. Rana 7 91 2008 M. Staffaroni et al. 10 166 2012 and G. R. Aizin and G. C. Dyer Phys. Rev. B 86 235316 2012 which are incorporated herein by reference. In high mobility 2DEG materials at microwave and THz frequencies underdamped LC plasma resonances are supported allowing for propagation lengths on the order of tens of micrometers or plasmon wavelengths.

The introduction of spatial periodicity to a 2DEG produces a plasmonic crystal PC where the 2DEG is a coherent plasmonic medium. Though a PC is physically more similar to a photonic crystal than a metamaterial the unit cell of a 2DEG PC is deeply subwavelength. These tunable plasmonic materials are conceptually related to certain periodic plasmonic nanostructures resonant microwave metalenses and acoustic metamaterials. See G. Shvets and Y. A. Urzhumov 93 243902 2004 F. Lemoult et al. 104 203901 2010 and F. Lemoult et al. 107 064301 2011 . In such systems band structure results from incident waves interacting with spatially periodic subwavelength resonant scatterers. See Z. Liu et al. 289 1734 2000 M. Davanco et al. 15 9681 2007 and F. Lemoult et al. 9 55 2013 .

As described below there is a complex interplay between surface states known as Tamm states plasmonic defect PD modes and the PC band structure in tunable THz plasmonic band gap devices engineered from a GaAs AlGaAs 2DEG. See I. E. Tamm 1 733 1932 . The two exemplary PC devices Samples A and B are shown in and respectively. Both figures show images of a broadband antenna vertex of the samples with gates G and G for both samples gate G for Sample B only and source S and drain D terminals. Both samples are integrated at the vertex of the antenna having bandwidth from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Both plasmonic structures are based upon a four period PC formed below gate G with an adjacent PD independently controlled by gate G. See E. A. Shaner et al. 18 1925 2006 and A. R. Davoyan et al. 108 127401 2012 . A PD is induced when G is tuned to a different voltage than G. While these plasmonic band gap structures are nearly 100 times smaller than the free space wavelength of THz radiation they cannot be considered an effective medium because the wavelengths of the THz plasmons tightly confined to the 2DEG are comparable to the size of the PC unit cell. See D. R. Smith et al. 71 036617 2005 and C. R. Simovski 1 62 2007 .

It is convenient to treat the PC unit cell using this equivalent circuit approach. shows the equivalent distributed circuit for the PC unit cell with gated and ungated region elements below G. The adjacent regions of 2DEG in this system can be represented as sequential distributed plasmonic RLC transmission line elements as described more fully in the section below titled . is a cross sectional schematic illustration of Sample A showing the coupling of fields to the plasmonic mixer induced below G with the depleted region shown as a dashed line and the 2DEG plasmonic crystal region below G indicated by a dotted line. The photovoltage Vis measured between the D and S terminals. The PC unit cell is indicated by a dashed box. The kinetic inductance L and resistance R of the equivalent distributed circuit are explicitly defined through the Drude conductivity of the 2DEG R i L See also P. J. Burke et al. 76 745 2000 and H. Yoon et al. Nature 488 65 2012 .

Tuning of the gate voltages G and G controls the 2DEG inductance and resistance L R 1 . Here j defines the normalized 2DEG density in terms of the threshold voltage V where n 0 and the applied gate voltages Vsuch that V V V. In terms of the PC unit cell diagrammed in the applied gate voltage Vcontrols the inductance Land resistance R. The ungated region of 2DEG has constant distributed inductance Land resistance R.

In the electrostatic potential of a plasma wave with a frequency of 456 GHz is illustrated in a four period PC formed between G and S. The distribution in the x z plane of the electrostatic potential is shown near the plane of the 2DEG indicated by a dark center line. Also shown in the lower part of the figure are the spatially periodic equilibrium 2DEG kinetic inductance L and density n of the four period PC. Here a 2 m plasmon wavelength below G is evident for the 456 GHz excitation with free space wavelength of 658 m or about 300.

A purely electronic approach was employed to probe the plasmonic band gap structures. Depletion of the 2DEG n 30 below a gate allowed for a conversion of plasma waves into a measurable photoresponse that can have both photoconductive and photovoltaic contributions. See M. I. Dyakonov and M. S. Shur 43 380 1996 E. A. Shaner et al. 18 1925 2006 G. C. Dyer et al. 100 083506 2012 and V. M. Muravev and I. V. Kukushkin 100 082102 2012 . The distributed THz excitation of the device terminals produces a plasmonic homodyne mixing response measured between the drain D and source S contacts as illustrated for Sample A in . See A. Lisauskas et al. J. Appl. Phys. 105 114511 2009 S. Preu et al. 111 024502 2012 S. Preu et al. 2 278 2012 and O. A. Klimenko et al. 112 014506 2012 . The local oscillator voltage Vis coupled from G to the region of depleted 2DEG below while the signal coupled to the mixer is the difference between the plasmonic voltages V Vgenerated on either side of the depletion region. A non linear plasmonic mixing mechanism in the region of depleted 2DEG down converts the component of the differential THz signal V Vin phase with Vto a photovoltage V .

The bulk plasmonic band structure in a PC having an infinite number of periods is first considered. The crystal dispersion of the infinite PC plotted in for several values of the normalized 2DEG density was calculated from the 1D Kronig Penney model for the unit cell shown in 

Threshold voltage Vof the exemplary devices was found using standard lock in techniques to measure transistor channel conductivity. A fit of the conductivity near threshold was extrapolated to determine V 2.67 V for Sample A and V 2.73 V for Sample B. Photoresponse measurements were performed with V 2.80 V for Sample A and V 2.80 V for Sample B. Samples A and B were characterized independently and aligned to the THz source using a raster scan to locate the maximum photovoltage signal at a given excitation frequency. All measurements were performed at T 8 K.

A four period PC between S and G can be induced in Sample A shown in by biasing the defect gate G past its threshold voltage as illustrated in . The PC formed below G delivers a plasmonic signal to a rectifying detection element under G generating a photovoltage V see section below titled . By tuning V and frequency as plotted in the measured photoresponse maps the plasmonic spectrum of Sample A. The light regions correspond to the resonant excitation of plasma modes in the system. The resonant modes calculated for the four period PC using the transfer matrix formalism shown by solid lines agree well with experiment. See G. C. Dyer et al. 109 126803 2012 and G. R. Aizin and G. C. Dyer 86 235316 2012 . Where the calculated resonances become extremely dense above 350 GHz and V

Each unit cell of the four period structure would have an identical resonant frequency in isolation. However the coherence of the plasma wave across the PC lifts this four fold degeneracy resulting in the formation of four state bands. Alternately this can be considered a Fano type system where interference between a continuum the allowed bands of the PC and the discrete modes of the cavity formed between S and G produces groups of four asymmetric resonances. See M. Davanco et al. 15 9681 2007 . These bands of states are demonstrated in to tune a minimum of 50 in frequency from 300 GHz to 450 GHz though in principle the shift of the band gap can be well in excess of 100 .

The first three experimentally observed resonances M M and M in moving from the lower right hand corner 300 GHz and V 0.00 V towards the upper left hand corner are positioned in an allowed infinite PC band. These bands are shown as dark lines. However the fourth mode M associated with this band is largely found in the second band gap of the infinite PC where it is shown as a light line. The same conclusion holds true for higher plasmonic bands. All regions of these modes shown as light lines are in the predicted band gaps corresponding to those labeled in including a pair near V 1.80 V and 300 GHz. These modes can potentially represent plasmonic Tamm states. See G. R. Aizin and G. C. Dyer 86 235316 2012 and I. E. Tamm 1 733 1932 . Tamm states weakly localized crystal surface states with a complex rather than purely real Bloch wavevector Im kd 0 are generally found in a band gap and have been experimentally demonstrated previously only in a few electronic optical and hybrid optical plasmonic systems. See H. Ohno et al. 64 2555 1990 T. Goto et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 113902 2008 and O. Gazzano et al. 107 247402 2011 . In contrast to surface states resulting from dislocations and impurities Tamm states form at the ideal termination of a lattice and are most easily isolated in tailorable structures like semiconductor superlattices and photonic crystals.

To confirm the presence of Tamm states in this system Sample B pictured in was studied with gate G biased beyond its threshold voltage. Here the last stripe of depleted 2DEG below G operates as a rectifying detector as illustrated in . The plasmonic detection region is indicated by dashes under G. This configuration of Sample B provides a means to study the strong coupling between the four period PC below G and a PD defined under G. See E. A. Shaner et al. 18 1925 2006 A. R. Davoyan et al. 108 127401 2012 and V. M. Muravev et al. 100 082102 2012 . The photoresponse to excitation frequencies of 302.5 363.0 and 420.5 GHz as G and G are independently tuned is shown in and respectively. As in the light regions represent plasma resonances. In and the calculated PC PD structure plasmon modes are plotted as solid lines for these same frequencies as a function of normalized 2DEG densities corresponding to the experimentally applied gate voltages. The band gaps of the infinite PC where the Bloch wavevector of experimentally observed resonances has a non zero imaginary component are indicated as vertical shaded regions.

An understanding of the relationship between the PC and PD states emerges when considering together. The four period PC modes are tuned by G and appear as vertical features when the PD is not resonating. PD resonances are modes controlled by G and appear as light horizontal lines where sequential anticrossings occur. When V V the PD may be viewed as a fifth identical unit cell that is appended to the four period PC under G. This condition is satisfied along the diagonal lines in where a fifth discrete mode is added to each band by a higher order mode moving into a lower energy band after traversing the infinite PC band gap. The boxes in highlight repelled crossings between Tamm and PD states in or near the second band gap along the diagonal line V V. A repelled crossing is found along this diagonal if and only if a PD and a Tamm state of the same order are mutually coupled. Because an isolated PD state is localized it must enter into a band gap before joining a five state band as an orthogonal PC mode. Only localized states are found in the infinite PC band gap.

A Tamm state localized at the Ohmic contact is the only viable candidate to cross with a PD mode along the line V V.

There are several additional distinctions between crossings of the PD modes with purely real valued Bloch wavevector PC states and with complex Bloch wavevector Tamm states. Modes in the allowed bands are completely delocalized and therefore are widely separated as they come into resonance with a PD mode. In and under 420.5 GHz excitation where the band gaps largely vanish none of the PC states becomes localized and for any fixed choice of V i.e. the resonances are widely spaced in V . In contrast due to the localization of Tamm states both their coupling with the PD and the size of the PD Tamm splitting are comparatively smaller. This leads to the close approach of the modes in the boxed regions of .

As the energy of a PD mode approaches that of the Tamm state by tuning V V both modes may be interpreted as Tamm states. The observed splitting results from the interaction of states bound to opposing ends of the PC. One Tamm state is weakly localized at the Ohmic contact. When the PD state energy matches that of the Tamm state a second Tamm state forms adjacent to the detection element. A phenomenon analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency EIT develops under these conditions because of the mutual coupling and asymmetric excitation of these two weakly localized modes. See N. Liu et al. 8 758 2009 P. Tassin et al. 102 053901 2009 R. D. Kekatpure et al. 104 243902 2010 and B. Luk yanchuk et al. 9 707 2010 .

Several conditions must be satisfied for the coupling of the PD to the Tamm state at the Ohmic contact to be considered an EIT phenomenon. See P. Tassin et al. 109 187401 2012 . The description of EIT in classical systems is that of two coupled oscillators one of which is bright and the other dark with respect to incident radiation. In this picture the PD and Tamm states then must be coherently coupled and resonate at the same frequency conditions that are satisfied empirically in this plasmonic system. More importantly there must be an asymmetry in both the external coupling and the damping rates of the coupled plasmonic oscillators. The dark resonance must be weakly externally coupled and have a higher quality factor than the bright resonance. In high quality 2DEG plasmonic systems weak coupling to an external excitation implies a higher Q resonance because radiative damping is the dominant dissipation mechanism of the plasmon see section below titled .

This plasmonic EIT like effect can be studied through analysis of the PC PD modes in and near the first band gap. While it is common to sweep frequency in order to map the interaction of strongly coupled resonators an approach of tuning resonators in situ with fixed excitation frequency yields the same information. See B. Luk yanchuk et al. 9 707 2010 . illustrates induced transparency in the first plasmonic band gap. In the photoresponse of Sample B with an excitation frequency of 210.0 GHz is shown. Here the characteristic frequency of the PC unit cell is swept for different detunings of the PD relative to PC unit cell. Each curve corresponds to a different detuning of the PD characteristic frequency relative to that of the PC unit cell from 100 to 100 GHz in 25 GHz steps. The characteristic plasma frequencies

For positive detunings 50 GHz an asymmetric resonance associated with the PD is observed at the edge of the band gap shown as a vertical shaded region in while the Tamm state appears inert due to its poor coupling to both the incident THz field and the integrated detector. The PD is interpreted as a bright resonator that under appropriate conditions can couple to and drive the dark Tamm state. The PD and Tamm states become strongly interacting when the detuning is reduced 50 GHz 50 GHz. As the energetic difference between these states decreases the bright PD excites the formerly dark Tamm state. A characteristic signature of EIT a symmetric double peak with a dip at its center is evident with the detuning set to 50 GHz. For negative detunings 

The plasmonic spatial distributions in highlight the evolution of the PD and Tamm states under 210.0 GHz excitation. The spatial voltage distributions in the plane of the 2DEG for modes M and M indicated by the arrows linking to are plotted for several detunings . The position corresponds directly to the mixer edge is at x 0 m the PD is located between 2 m x 4 m and the PC is found between 6 m x 22 m. Both the bright PD state seen distinctly with 0 for M and 

Induced transparency can take on multiple connotations in this context. In a literal sense the PD Tamm state coupling allows for the plasmon mode trapped near the Ohmic contact to couple to the opposing edge of the PC. The Tamm state in the opaque band gap then is observable by the integrated detector. However the more rigorous definition of EIT is also satisfied due to the coherent coupling of PD and Tamm states and the inherent asymmetries of the PC PD structure.

The following sections describe the computational approach and the theory of plasmonic crystals formed from a 2DEG how a DC response results from a homodyne mixing mechanism by comparison of photoresponse and transport data calculations of the plasmon Q factor and propagation length and comparison of these results to measurements of the plasmonic spectrum in four and eight period plasmonic crystal samples and the scalability of the plasmonic crystal through the predicted band structure of GaAs AlGaAs and GaN AlGaN devices.

A generalized transmission line TL theory was used to describe the plasmonic states in a periodically modulated 2DEG. In this approach an electron plasma wave propagating in the 2D channel is described in terms of the equivalent TL with distributed R L and C circuit elements as shown in . See G. C. Dyer et al. 109 126803 2012 and G. R. Aizin and G. C. Dyer 86 235316 2012 which are incorporated herein by reference. The intrinsic resistance R and kinetic inductance L of the 2D channel is based on the Drude conductivity of the 2DEG. The intrinsic 2DEG kinetic inductance is L m en where e is the electron charge nis the intrinsic density of the 2DEG and m is the electron effective mass. The intrinsic 2DEG resistance subsequently can be expressed as R L where is the plasmon damping time. Equivalent circuit capacitance per unit area can be defined as C where and are fluctuations of electron density and electric potential respectively in the plasma wave with frequency and wave vector q. Solving the electrostatic equations in the quasi static approximation gives 1 4 where d is the gate channel separation and s is the permittivity of GaAs. See G. C. Dyer et al. 109 126803 2012 . This is an explicit expression equivalent to Eq. 1 specific to a screened 2DEG system. With these definitions of the distributed circuit elements the plasmon dispersion relation can be expressed through the standard TL formulas. See C. Paul 2007 . In the high mobility 2DEG samples with large quality factor Q L R 1 plasmon damping can be neglected and the plasmon dispersion law written in terms of the TL model is

The 2D electron channel in the periodically gated samples A and B can be considered as a segmented TL with individual segments corresponding to the gated or ungated 2DEG regions. The transfer matrix for the jplasmonic TL segment of length a is given by

The transfer matrix formalism was also used to find the plasmonic band spectrum of the infinite PC with lattice constant and a bipartite unit cell consisting of the ungated j 0 and gated j 1 segments of equal length. This PC is described by the standard 1D Kronig Penney model with dispersion determined by the equation

For the numerical results shown the approximation that both ungated and gated 2DEG regions were screened identically by the gate metallization d 400 nm above the 2DEG was used. Thus the step like spatial modulation of the system was primarily imposed by the differences in the carrier density. No assumptions were made with regards to how the distributed excitation is coupled to the PC defect system. The calculations were performed using a code as follows. First Eq. 5 was solved numerically at each value of the density modulation and frequency to find the wave vector q. Then these results were used to find numerical solutions of Eq. 11 and to find the plasmonic band gaps from Eq. 12 . By using the equivalent TL transfer matrix method rather than a full FDTD approach dense mappings of the phase space can be computed rapidly on a standard laptop computer. The trade off is a lack of precise knowledge of the field distribution surrounding the device at the antenna vertex.

The plasmonic crystal structure can be characterized using a detector like geometry. The antenna PC structure shown in and constitutes a passive but reconfigurable integrated THz photonic circuit with three fundamental components terahertz voltage generators plasmonic waveguides and plasmonic mixers. The broadband log periodic antenna in couples THz radiation quasi optically from a microwave frequency multiplier to the plasmonic circuit. The antenna functions as the voltage generator of the circuit by providing a distributed excitation of the device at its vertex. Due to the modest capacitive reactances typical capacitances on the order of 1 fF corresponds to a 318 Ohm reactance at 500 GHz between devices terminals no special techniques are required to couple to the gate terminals. The phase of the excitation field can be considered as nearly constant across the PC and mixing elements though no assumptions are made concerning the amplitude of the field. The regions of 2DEG below and between the gate metallization function as waveguides delivering a signal to the mixer. The plasmonic mixer is induced when the 2DEG below a gate or multiple gate fingers is depleted n 0. The non linearity of the transport in this region allows for THz plasmonic mixing. Additionally as n 0 the plasmon wavevector becomes infinite q and the mixer also has an infinite electrical length. The regions of 2DEG on opposing sides of the mixer are consequently decoupled.

Study of the photovoltage by sweeping gates G G and G of Sample B see validates the assertion that the measured response is a homodyne plasmonic mixing signal. This is shown in where Sample B is illuminated with 360 GHz radiation at 8 K and one gate is swept while the other two are held at ground potential. The photovoltaic response was measured using a lock in amplifier LIA with 75 Hz modulation of the incident radiation. The amplitude of the homodyne mixing signal produced by all three gates follows the transport curve for gate G as in Eq. 13 . This indicates that each finger of gates G and G acts as a discrete mixer since the response tracks the non linearity of the single finger gate G transport. This is illustrated schematically in for gate G biased to its threshold voltage showing that the four induced plasmonic mixing elements produce a mixing response as if there were only a single mixing element induced. To produce a net rectified signal an asymmetry in the voltage signals delivered to the mixing elements is required. See V. V. Popov et al. 99 243504 2011 . Due to the symmetry of the excitation and 2DEG between depleted regions the four finger gate in fact behaves nearly identically to a single finger in terms of its homodyne mixing response. The symmetry of the identical 2DEG regions and excitation in the three regions of 2DEG between the gate fingers leads to no net photovoltage. Only the 2DEG at the far left and right edges of gate G can have an asymmetry that yields a non zero plasmonic mixing photovoltage.

The polarity of the signal reverses when G and G are exchanged as the gates are held at threshold bias. See V. M. Muravev and I. V. Kukushkin 100 082102 2012 . This demonstrates the differential nature of the mixing signal because source and drain side waveguides have their roles exchanged. With G biased to its threshold voltage the 2DEG below G and G is excited and produces a net positive photovoltage since V t V t . With G biased to its threshold voltage the 2DEG below G and G is excited and produces a net negative photovoltage since V t 

The relative maxima of the negative polarity photovoltage V V can be interpreted as resonances. Because the PC structure is formed on the source side of the mixer in both Samples A and Sample B the contribution V t to the measured photovoltage is negative in polarity. From the perspective of a multi port network the absolute minima in response then correspond to maxima in the real part of the input impedance of the PC structure as seen from the port adjacent to the plasmonic mixer. Conversely relative maxima in V V then are minima in the real part of the input impedance as seen from the plasmonic mixer.

Because the radiation resistance of the antenna is approximately 72 Ohms for these exemplary device geometries minima in their input impedance produce optimal impedance matching and thus optimal power coupling to the plasmonic circuit. The resonances as defined should thus be viewed as peaks in power coupling or transmission across the structure. This is also consistent with the interpretation of the observed defect Tamm state splitting as electromagnetically induced transparency. It follows that the self normalization of the response at fixed measurement frequencies is given by

The TL model described above can be adapted to include plasmon damping by accounting for dissipation in the definitions of the transmission line characteristic impedance and dispersion. For calculating the plasmon Q factor and propagation lengths it is sufficient to define the dispersion law as

To determine the plasmon Q factor and propagation length from Eq. 15 it is convenient to rewrite the dispersion law as 19 Then the Q factor can be defined as 

In and respectively the plasmon Q factor and coherence length Lcalculated for the gated GaAs AlGaAs 2DEG are plotted as a function of frequency for several values of the normalized carrier density . The Q factor of the plasma wave is approximately 10 25 in the range of frequencies studied 200 450 GHz shown with vertical dashed lines and increases modestly as the 2DEG density is lowered. The coherence length however depends much more critically on both the 2DEG density and frequency. In the frequency range studied LC

A clear indication of coherent excitation across the full length of an n period plasmonic lattice is the observation of n modes in each crystal band. Accordingly four and five modes per band are observed for four and five period PCs respectively. Two modes in each incipient plasmonic crystal band were also recently demonstrated in a two period plasmonic lattice. See G. C. Dyer et al. 109 126803 2012 . Because the coherence lengths in are of the same order as the size of the PCs studied a significantly longer structure than that of a four or five period PC is unlikely to display collective plasma resonances across the full structure. To test this hypothesis an eight period plasmonic lattice was studied.

In the homodyne mixing response of an eight period plasmonic lattice Sample C is compared to that of Sample A a four period PC at several excitation frequencies. Here the PC is formed between G and the source contact with G tuning the plasmonic lattice analogous to the measurements performed in . If all eight PC unit cells in Sample C are coherently coupled double the number of modes would be expected relative to the four period PC Sample A . While Sample C displays additional structure in its response spectrum as well as an apparent small shift in the spectrum to lower 2DEG densities there is no unequivocal indication of a lifted eight fold degeneracy.

With 210 GHz excitation there are three distinct peaks for both samples. Though there are suggestions of a peak slightly past V 0 and a splitting of the peak near V 1.5 coherence across the entire eight periods of Sample C would require six distinct peaks over the measured range. The plasmonic excitation has not lost its coherence given that there are still distinct modes observed in the expected PC bands. But the coherence is not sufficient to couple all PC unit cells in the device. There is one additional resonance evident in Sample C s spectrum in comparison to Sample A s in the range 0 V 1.75 for 270 and 330 GHz excitations. These added features in the photoresponse confirm that adding four additional periods has altered the PC spectrum but fall short of demonstrating the long range coherence required for an eight period PC. For all excitation frequencies shown the decreased coherence length at reduced 2DEG density V

The typical plasmonic band structure of two materials a GaAs AlGaAs and a GaN AlGaN 2DEG were calculated to illustrate the scalability in frequency of plasmonic crystals. The plasmonic crystal dispersion is found from Eq. 12 using the PC unit cell illustrated in and the same assumptions made in calculating . The results are shown in for typical GaAs AlGaAs and for typical GaN AlGaN 2DEG material parameters.

To calculate the scaled band structure for a GaAs AlGaAs 2DEG a gate channel separation of d 100 nm a region of gate tuned 2DEG a 250 nm wide a region of untuned 2DEG a 250 nm wide and an intrinsic 2DEG density of n 4.0 10cmwere assumed. In comparison to the exemplary devices described above this corresponds to a scaling downward in metallization feature size by a factor of 8 which can be realized using available electron beam lithography techniques and a reduction in the setback of the 2DEG from the gate. All other parameters such as GaAs permittivity and electron effective mass are unchanged.

The band structure of a GaN AlGaN plasmonic crystal was calculated using the parameters for a GaN AlGaN 2DEG defined by Muravjov et al m 0.2 m n 7.5 10cm 9.5 and d 28 nm. See A. V. Muravjov et al. 96 042105 2010 . A bipartite gated ungated PC unit cell was also assumed with each element having width a 250 nm. Not only is the length scale of the crystal reduced relative to the exemplary devices but the 2DEG density is also an order of magnitude larger. Both of these attributes serve to shift the band structure higher in frequency.

In the first PBG is found around 0.7 to 0.8 THz depending on the density tuning of the GaAs AlGaAs 2DEG below the gated region. The second PBG occurs above 1 THz. The increase in frequency of the band structure relative to the results for the exemplary devices is entirely due to the reduction in the PC unit cell size. This serves to illustrate that for GaAs AlGaAs 2DEGs eventually the PC will be limited by the minimum feature size.

The choice of a GaN AlGaN 2DEG material system in affords a significant upward shift of the full band structure due to the additional increase in 2DEG density. The first PBG is above 1 THz and the second PBG is above 2 THz for both normalized 2DEG densities. This is a striking illustration of the possibility of scaling tunable plasmonic crystals to frequencies well above 1 THz.

Graphene can also be used for plasmonic crystal structures. Although the plasmon dispersion is not identical to that of semiconductor 2DEGs conceptually identical PC systems can be realized in graphene based plasmonic structures. Recent efforts have demonstrated infrared plasmons in graphene. See J. Chen et al. 487 77 2012 and Z. Fei et al. 487 82 2012 . If metal structures are scaled appropriately to the graphene plasmon wavelength at a given operating frequency band graphene infrared plasmonic crystals operating at room temperature can be provided.

The present invention has been described as a tunable plasmonic crystal. It will be understood that the above description is merely illustrative of the applications of the principles of the present invention the scope of which is to be determined by the claims viewed in light of the specification. Other variants and modifications of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art.
