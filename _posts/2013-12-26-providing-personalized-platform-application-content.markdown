title: Providing personalized platform application content
abstract: A social networking website maintains a profile for each user of the website. The profile includes data associated with a user, such as a connection to one or more plurality of other users of the social networking website or user preferences. The social networking website communicates with one or more third-party application servers to provide one or more applications to social networking website users. When a social networking website user requests an application provided by a third-party application server, the social networking website communicates a subset of the user's profile to the third-party application server, allowing the third-party application server to use this profile data to personalize the application performed for the user. A privacy setting associated with a user profile allows the social networking website to limit the profile data communicated to the third-party application server.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 138 212 filed Jun. 12 2008 now allowed which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 934 365 filed Jun. 12 2007 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The invention generally relates to social networking and more specifically to personalizing a third party application based on user specific data from a social network.

Social networks or communities of entities that share interests or activities or are interested in exploring the interests of other entities have become more prevalent. Particularly social networking websites have allowed users or entities to more efficiently communicate information among each other. For example a user may post contact information background information job information hobbies or other user specific data to a social networking website. Other users or entities can then review the posted data by browsing user profiles or searching for profiles including specific data.

Some social networking websites incorporate a system for connecting users to content most relevant to each user. For example users are grouped according to one or more common attributes in their profiles such as geographic location employer job type music preferences or other attributes. Additionally some social networks allow a user to access one or more third party applications from the social network. These third party applications are run within the social networking websites. Such applications can extend the functionality of the social networking website providing users with new and interesting ways to communicate collaborate and interact with each other. For example a social network website includes a widget which allows a user to access data or services provided by a third party. Hence the widget or a similar user interface allows a social networking website user to interact with a third party application separate from the social networking website.

Although the social networking website allows a user to receive content from the social network that is personalized based on user data information provided by a third party application is not personalized unless the user separately provides information to the third party application. Hence the user must provide separate sets of data to the social networking website and the third party application to receive personalized content from both sources. The third party application cannot access user data stored by the social networking website associated with the user.

To provide personalized interaction with a third party application a social networking website shares stored information about its users with a third party application server. A third party application configured to execute within the social networking website can access the stored information about a user and construct content pages based on the information specific to the user. As a result the user of social networking website is able to receive personalized content or information from the third party application. The stored information for the user includes information about the user such as the user s interests preferences demographics and so forth as well as information identifying the user s friends. From the information identifying the user s friends additional content associated with such friends can be accessed and also used to construct content pages for the initial user. For example a third party application may provide a listing of the social networking website user s favorite songs and user data from the social networking website to also provide favorite songs of one or more additional social networking website users associated with the social networking website user.

In an embodiment a user communicates a request to access a third party application to the social networking website. The social networking website identifies a third party application server associated with the request and verifies that the user is associated with a user profile maintained by the social networking website. For example the social networking website requests user identification such as a username and password from the user to identify the user profiler associated with the user. The social networking website transmits the request and a user identifier to the third party application server. Additionally the social networking website also transmits a subset of data from the user profile associated with the user such as the user s friends the user s most recently added friends the user s picture or other user data to the third party application server. To maintain the privacy of social networking website users the social networking website first examines a privacy setting associated with each user profile and does not transmit to the third party application server any data that a user has configured to be inaccessible to the to the viewing user or to third party applications. The third party application server then generates application content based on the request the user identifier and any additional data provided by the social networking website. The third party application can also directly request data that was based on the user identifier from the social networking website. In either case the application content is personalized as it is based on the user identifier and additional data. In one embodiment the personalized application content is specific to user directly such as based on the user s preferences interests demographics other users associated with the user recent activities or affiliation with one or more other users. In a further embodiment the application content is personalized to the user as it is based on information about the user s friends for example the interests demographics and other data associated with the user s friends. Thus the third party application is able to offer content that is directly of interest to the user being based on the information the social networking website maintains about the user and or the user s friends and is not limited to generic content.

Alternatively the user may initially transmit a request to access an application to the third party application server. The third party application server then communicates this request to the social networking website which determines whether the user has a user profile stored on the social networking website such as by requesting that the user login to the social networking website. The social networking website then examines a privacy setting associated with the user profile to determine what data if any is accessible by the third party application server. The social network website then communicates data to the third party application server responsive to the privacy setting. An application output is then generated using the provided data and displayed to the user by the third party application server.

The features and advantages described in the specification are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The client devices comprise one or more computing devices which transmit and or receive data via network and receive user input. For example client devices can be desktop computers laptop computers smartphones personal digital assistants PDAs mobile computing devices or any other device including computing functionality and data communication capabilities.

A third party application server comprises a source such as a computing device or a virtual machine that is associated with one or more identifiers such as a single DNS entry e.g. www.domainA.com or related DNS entries e.g. all registrations with the base name www.domainA.com . The third party application server communicates or shares data information or services with client devices the social networking website via the network responsive to requests by a client device or by the social networking website . For example the third party application server receives data from a client device via network processes the received data and transmits output data back to the client device via network . The third party application server provides applications which are configured to execute within the social networking website s runtime environment. Examples of applications provided by the third party application server include applications for online sales online auctions gift giving meetings event management discussion boards or other application that provides data or other information to a client device through the network .

Applications provided by the third party application server provide enhanced content and interactivity within the social network host site which also maintains an application object for each application hosted in the social networking website. An example application is an enhanced messaging service in which members can send virtual objects such as a gift or flowers and an optional message to another member. The use of any functionality offered by the application may thus constitute an action by a social network host site user in connection with the application. In addition continuing the example from above the receipt of the virtual gift or message may also be considered an action in connection with the application. It can therefore be appreciated that actions may be passive and need not require active participation by a member. The scope and type of applications provided is limited only by the imagination and creativity of the application developers. Applications are generally written as server side code that is run on the third party application server although an application may also use client side code as appropriate.

The social network host site comprises a computing system which allows one or more users to interact with each other using network . For example the social network host site stores data such as user profiles or user preferences describing users of the social network host site also called members of a social network or members and also stores data describing one or more relationships between different users. Each user in the social network host site is related to one more or more other users through some social relationship such as relative friends co workers members of a common organization alumni of a common educational facility and so forth. For ease of description other users who related to a given user in any of the foregoing or other ways are called the given user s friends. 

Hence the social network host site offers its members the ability to communicate and interact with other members of the website. In use members join the social networking host site and then add connections to a number of other members to whom they desire to be connected. As used herein the term friend refers to any other member to whom a member has formed a connection association or relationship via the website. Connections may be added explicitly by a member for example the member selecting a particular other member to be a friend or automatically created by the social network host site based on common characteristics of the members e.g. members who are alumni of the same educational institution . Connections in social networking websites are usually in both directions but need not be so the terms member and friend depend on the frame of reference. For example if Bob and Joe are both members and connected to each other in the website Bob and Joe both members are also each other s friends. The connection between members may be a direct connection however some embodiments of a social network host site allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections. Also the term friend need not require that members actually be friends in real life which would generally be the case when one of the members is a business or other entity it simply implies a connection in the social networking website.

The social network host site provides various mechanisms allowing members to communicate with each other or to obtain information that they find interesting such as activities that their friends are involved with applications that their friends are installing comments made by friends on activities of other friends etc. Examples of the mechanisms allowing members to communicate with each other include 

In addition to interactions with other members the social network host site provides members with the ability to take actions on various types of items supported by the website. These items may include groups or networks where networks here refer not to physical communication networks but rather social networks of people to which members of the website may belong events or calendar entries in which a member might be interested computer based applications that a member may use via the website and transactions that allow members to buy or sell items via the website. These are just a few examples of the items upon which a member may act on a social network host site and many others are possible.

The social network host site also maintains a number of objects for the different kinds of items with which a member may interact on the social network host site . In one example embodiment these objects include user profiles group objects event objects application objects respectively hereinafter groups events and applications . In one embodiment an object is stored by the social network host site for each instance of its associated item. For example a user profile is stored for each member who joins the social network host site a group is stored for each group defined in the social network host site and so on.

A member of the social network host site may take specific actions on the social network host site where each action is associated with one or more objects. The types of actions that a member may perform in connection with an object are defined for each object and largely depend on the type of item represented by the object. A particular action may be associated with multiple objects. Described below are a number of examples of particular types of objects that may be defined for the social network host site as well as a number of actions that can be taken for each object. These objects and the actions discussed herein are provided for illustration purposes only and it can be appreciated that an unlimited number of variations and features can be provided on a social networking host site .

The social network host site maintains a user profile for each member of the social network host site . Any action that a particular member takes with respect to another member is associated with each user s profile through information maintained in a database or other data repository. Such actions may include for example adding a connection to the other member sending a message to the other member reading a message from the other member viewing content associated with the other member attending an event posted by another member among others. In addition a number of actions described below in connection with other objects are directed at particular members so these actions are associated with those members as well. The user profiles also describe characteristics such as work experience educational history hobbies or preferences location or similar data of various users and includes data describing one or more relationships between users such as data indicating users having similar or common work experience hobbies or educational history. Additionally the social network host site includes user defined relationships between different users allowing users to customize their relationships with other users. For example this user specific customization allows users of the social network host site to generate relationships with other users that parallel the user s real life relationships such as other users with the same educational history or other users in the same location.

A group may be defined for a group or network of members. For example a member may define a group to be a fan club for a particular band. The social network host site would maintain a group for that fan club which might include information about the band media content e.g. songs or music videos by the band and discussion boards on which members of the group can comment about the band. Accordingly member actions that are possible with respect to a group might include joining the group viewing the content listening to songs watching videos and posting a message on the discussion board.

Similarly an event may be defined for a particular event such as a birthday party. A member may create the event by defining information about the event such as the time and place and a list of invitees. Other members may accept the invitation comment about the event post their own content e.g. pictures from the event and perform any other actions enabled by the social network host site for the event. Accordingly the creator of the event as well as the invitees for the event may perform various actions that are associated with that event.

The social network host site also enables members to add applications to their profiles. These applications provide enhanced content and interactivity within the social networking host site which maintains an application object for each application hosted in the system environment. The applications may be provided by the website operator and or by third party developers via third party application server . An example application is an enhanced messaging service in which members can send virtual objects such as a gift or flowers and an optional message to another member. The use of any functionality offered by the application may thus constitute an action by the member in connection with the application. In addition continuing the example from above the receipt of the virtual gift or message may also be considered an action in connection with the application. It can therefore be appreciated that actions may be passive and need not require active participation by a member. The scope and type of applications provided is limited only by the imagination and creativity of the application developers. Generally when a user logs into the site the system environment determines which applications the user has installed e.g. registered for and then loads and runs such applications in combination with the underlying functionality of the social network host site .

Additionally the social network host site allows different users to communicate with one or more additional members using the network . For example the social network host site allows a user associated with client device A to communicate with a second user associated with client device B using network . The social network host site is described below in further detail in conjunction with .

The network may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems. Alternatively the network is replaced by a peer to peer configuration where the client devices third party application server and social network host site directly communicate with each other.

Referring to a block diagram of an example social network host site is shown. The social network host website includes a communication module a user profile store an event store a group store an action log a user log a news feed generation module and an application identification module . In other embodiments the social network host website includes different and or additional modules.

The communication module links the social network host website to the network or to one or more client devices and or third party application servers . The communication module is a network interface which supports a networking protocol stack such as the Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model OSI Model . Hence the communication module allows the social network host website to communicate with the network using wireless and or wired communication methods.

The user profile store includes data associated with different social network host site users. When a user requests access to a service provided by the social network host website a user profile is generated for that user and stored in the user profile store . The user profile includes data describing one or more characteristics associated with the user such as demographic information geographic location educational history employment status employment history user interests user hobbies and or additional descriptive data. A user profile also includes privacy settings indicating how accessible is to other users is any of the information in the user profile user contact information or user defined relationships with other users such as the user s friends networks groups or the like. The user profile store can organize the stored user profiles by a social networking identifier which is used to uniquely identify social network host website users.

The event store includes data describing various events that occur outside of the social network host website . For example the event store includes data describing a concert movie meeting or other physical event that occurs in the real world events occurring within the social network host site or in any other online site. The event store includes data describing the name of the event an event start and end time an event location e.g. a city or a website a list of users attending the event or other descriptive data. Additionally the event store can include data or information summarizing the event after it ends such as photos videos reviews or a discussion board associated with the event. The event store can communicate with the user profile store allowing users to be associated with events. The event store can organize the stored event data according to an event identifier which uniquely identifies each stored event.

The group store includes data describing various groups of users or relationships between users of the social network host site . For example the group store includes data describing a group name and a list of social network identifiers associated with the group. Additionally the group store can include data or information describing the group or one or more members of the group such as photographs video data audio data or text data posted or otherwise attributed to a group member. The group store can communicate with the user profile store event store and or the action log allowing events actions and or users to be associated with a group. The group store can organize the stored event data according to a group identifier which uniquely identifies each stored group. The various stores are managed by a database management system preferably using a redundant distributed architecture. Portions of the stores can be maintained on disc or in memory as desired to improve performance and scalability.

The action log includes data describing various actions taken by users within the social network host site . The stored actions can occur within the social network host site as well on other sites via an application programming interface exposed by the social network host site . In one embodiment the social network host site maintains the action log as a database of entries. When an action is taken on the social network host site an entry for that action is added to the action log. Examples of user actions within the social network include sending a message to a friend using a third party application joining a group leaving a group adding a relationship to another user removing a relationship to another user modifying a stored user profile generating an event description or other modification or retrieval of data stored by the social network host site . Examples of user actions outside of the social network host site include purchasing or reviewing a product or service using an online marketplace hosted by a third party application server registering with or subscribing to a website hosted by a third party application server purchase requesting information from a website hosted by a third party application server or similar actions performed on a third party application server . The action log includes data describing the user performing the action the time the action occurred an identifier for the user who performed the action an identifier for the member to whom the action was directed an identifier for the type of action performed an identifier for an object acted on by the action e.g. an application content associated with the action where the action occurred and or other data describing the action. It can be appreciated that many types of actions that are possible in the social network host site need not require all of this information. For example if a member changes a picture associated with the member s profile the action may be logged with just the member s identifier an action type defining a picture change and the picture or a link thereto as the content. The action log can communicate with the user profile store event store and or the group store allowing events users and or groups to be associated with an action. The action log can organize the stored action data according to an action identifier which uniquely identifies each stored action. The action log can store actions based on when the action occurred. For example the action log may use a last in first out LIFO log structure to store actions so that the most recent actions are retrieved from the action log first. In one embodiment a single action log stores actions from all of the social network host site users and organizes the stored actions according to user identifiers or partitions the action log to allocate storage for different users. Alternatively the social network host site includes multiple action logs associated with different subsets of the user population such as by affiliation group geography or the like.

For each user a user log is maintained based on actions extracted from the action log . A given user s log includes data from the action log describing user actions and can include additional data from the user profile store event store and or group store that is associated with or affected by the action to further annotate or tag the action data. The user log can organize the action and related data chronologically allowing the user log to record the sequence in which actions were performed by the user and allowing easier access to more recent user actions.

The news feed generator is adapted to communicate with the user log and generates for each user a news feed comprising one or more stories based on the content of the user log associated with a particular user. A story is a message that summarizes condenses or abstracts one or more of actions of the user from that user s log . The generated news feed stories can then be transmitted to one or more related users e.g. the user s friends allowing the user s actions to be shared with such related users. The news feed generator applies an affinity algorithm to the contents of the user log accounting for a user s relationships with other users or groups as specified in the user profile store and or group store to select the actions in the log that are to be the basis of one or more stories for distribution to the related users. By accounting for the user relationships with other users and or groups the news feed generator determines data from the user log most relevant to other related users.

In one embodiment the news feed generator examines the contents of the user log of a given user for all actions occurring over a selected past interval such as a day or a week. The news feed generator then generates a message a story based upon to one more actions in the user log . For example the news feed generator generates a message identifying the given user e.g. User A the type of action and optionally a user group or other entity affected by the action e.g. User A joined Group 1 . For various messages the news feed generator determines the interest of various related users to different messages associated with the given user. For example the news feed generator determines how recently a related user accessed data from or associated with the given user how often a related user has accessed data from or associated with the given user the amount of common or similar data in the profiles of the given user and the related user and or other factors representative of user interest in a particular message. Based on the determined level of related user interest a message is communicated to those related users with the highest interest in the information message. This process can also be applied to the user logs of the related users for a given user. For example for a given user A the user logs of related users B C D E can be processed for a selected interval and one or more messages constructed for user A based on the actions of users B C D and E. Thus user A may receive messages such as Users B and C are attending event X or User C sent User D a gift or User D is now friends with User E. 

The application identification module includes data associated with one or more third party application servers and communicates with the user profile store and communication module . For clarity the application identification module is described with reference to which illustrates an example implementation of an application identification module . In an embodiment the application identification module includes one or more application profiles associated with various third party application servers that communicate with the social network host site . The application profiles shown in the example of include an application identifier an application address and application data .

The social network host site receives from a client device a request to access a third party application server for a specific third party application provided by that server the request includes an application identifier associated with the third party application such as an application name identification code or the like. This allows the application identifier to uniquely identify various applications provided by one or more third party application servers . The received request is passed to application identification module which uses the application identifier to identify a third party application server associated with the received request by identifying an application address associated with the received application identifier . The application address included in an application profile includes data identifying a Uniform Resource Indicator URI Internet Protocol IP address or other data describing how to access the third party application server providing the requested application.

The application profile also associates application data with the application identifier and application address . The application data identifies data stored by the social network host site that is transmitted to third party application server . For example the application data identifies one or more parameters of a stored user profile such as geographic location educational history employment status employment history user interests user hobbies and or additional descriptive data that is to be accessed by the third party application server to construct the application content. In one embodiment the application data uses parameter names or identifiers specified by a programming language such as Facebook Markup Language FBML or other programming language describing storage and or display of data. In the example shown in the application data uses parameter identifiers FB SIG ADDED to request data indicating whether a user has previously accessed the third party application server FB SIG FRIENDS to request data describing a list of the user s friends from the social network host site and FB PROFILE PIC to request an image associated with a user profile. The application data shown in are merely examples and in other embodiments any other parameter identifies or names can be specified. The application data specifies data that is retrieved from the user profile associated with the user requesting access to the third party application server and is transmitted to the third party application server from the social network host site . In one configuration the application identification module uses a relational database to store the application profiles .

Initially a social network host site receives a request from a client device to access an application provided by a third party application server . For example a client device user provides a URI to access the social network host site that identifies an application provided by the third party application server such as a URI having the form of apps.facebook.com fluff which identifies the social network host site apps.facebook.com and identifies the requested application fluff . Hence the URI or other application request includes an application identifier that is used by the application identification module of the social network host site to identify the third party application server associated with the requested application. For example the application identifier included in the URI or other application request used to access the social network host site is processed to identify an application profile including the application address associated with the application identifier . For example a hash function is applied to the received URI or other application request to identify the application profile including the application address associated with the requested application. The application address is a URI used to access the third party application server associated with the received application identifier . The application address is prepended to the application name to form a full URI for accessing the third party application at the third party server.

The social network host site verifies that the user providing the request is a member of the social network host website . In one embodiment the social network host website transmits a message to the client device requesting that the user enter a login name and password or other user credentials associated with the social network host site . Alternatively the application request initially received by the social network host site includes a login name and password or other user credentials associated with the user requesting the application. The social network host site then verifies the user by authenticating the provided user credentials.

After verifying that the requesting user is a member of the social network host site the social network host site transmits the user identifier to the application address associated with the third party application server . In addition to providing the user identifier the social network host site also transmits a session key to the third party application server . The session key is uniquely associated with the particular user and session and is used to identify data exchanges between the social network host site and the third party application server . Additionally the session key specifies a length of time during which the social network host site exchanges data with the third party application server so that after the specified length of time lapses data is not exchanged between third party application server and social network host site . Alternatively the session key indicates that the social network host site and third party application server exchange data for an indefinite interval allowing data to be exchanged until terminated by the requesting user. Hence the session key is generated by the social network host site after verifying that there is a social networking user profile associated with the requesting user and is used to uniquely identify data exchanges between the social network host site and the third party application server . In an embodiment the social network host site transmits additional data to the third party application server . For example the social network host site retrieves data specified by the application data associated with the application identifier from a user profile associated with the user requesting the application. This allows the social network host site to provide data from the user profile of the requesting user to the third party application server to customize the data provided by the third party application server .

After receiving the user identifier and any additional data from the social network host site the third party application server processes the received data to generate application content. The third party application server may request additional data associated with the user identifier from the social network host site during processing of the received data. This enables the third party application server to obtain additional information about the requesting user from the social network host site allowing the third party application server to further personalize the generated application content based on specific user data. For example the third party application server requests data describing other members the requesting user has recently added as friends or requests describing actions recently taken by friends of the requesting user.

As indicated above this application data provided to the application server can include any data from the user profile as well as information from the user profiles of the user s friends. In one embodiment the provided application data is limited to that data which is available pursuant to the user s privacy setting as well as in according to the privacy settings of the user s friends. In one embodiment this is implemented as follows. First the social network host site obtains all of the user data and data of the user s friends as described above. The social network host site then evaluates one or more privacy settings of the user profile of the requesting user to determine whether the data requested by the third party application server is able to be accessed by third parties. This allows the requesting user to regulate what data in the user profile is accessible by the third party application by modifying the privacy settings. Hence the third party application server is only able to access certain user selected data from the user profile. Similarly if the third party application server requests data from additional users such as the requesting user s friends the privacy settings of the additional users are examined. This prevents the third party application server from receiving information from the additional users that the additional users have not made publicly available. Thus while the social network host site allows the third party application server to access information associated with the requesting user from the social network host site the accessible information is limited by user privacy settings allowing different users to regulate the type and amount of information accessible by the third party application server . In sum the application content is both personalized to the current user and constrained by the privacy settings of the user and the user s friends.

The social network host site then transmits the requested data or a subset of the requested data to the third party application server . The third party application server then generates the application content such as an output message or other data based on the requested data and transmitted user identifier and other associated data. As can be appreciated this application content is personalized to the user as it is based at least on the user profile data and optionally as well on the information from the user profiles of the user s friends. The generated result is then transmitted from the third party application server to the social network host site where the result is displayed .

Communicating user profile data between the social network host site and the third party application server allows the third party application server to customize interaction with a user based on user data stored by the social network host site . This allows the third party application server to provide more relevant information or services to the social network site user improving interaction between the social network site user and the third party application server .

For example assume a third party application is configured to provide the functionality of displaying a user s favorite songs along with retrieving data from the social network site host allows the application to additionally display the favorite songs of one or more friends of the social network site user. As can be appreciated this information will be tailored to each user individually since each user has a unique combination of user data as well as friends. By personalizing the application content in this manner the application is significantly more interesting and relevant to the user as compared to a generic application that would merely display the most popular songs within the social network host site overall. This is because users are more interested in what their friends are interested in that what others unknown to the user are interested in. Additionally providing access to user profile data by the social network host site to the third party application server simplifies user interaction with the third party application server by allowing the third party application server to initially display socially relevant information to the user rather than requiring the user to provide additional data to the third party application server .

Initially a third party application server receives a request from a client device to access an application. For example a client device user provides a URI or other application request to access the third party application server which identifies an application provided by the third party application server . For example a client device user provides a URI to access the third party application server that identifies an application provided by the third party application server such as a URI identifying the requested application. The third party application server then determines an application identifier associated with the requested application. For example the third party application server extracts the application identifier from the URI or other application request. The third party application server then transmits to the social network host site the application identifier associated with the requested application and an access request via network . The access request identifies a subset of user profile data stored by the social network host site associated with the requesting user. Alternatively the third party application server transmits the application identifier to the social network host site which identifies identify application data associated with the application identifier by accessing an application identification module .

Upon receiving the application identifier and access request the social network host site determines a user identifier associated with the requesting user. In one embodiment the social network host website transmits a message to the client device requesting that the user enter a login name and password or other user credentials associated with the social network host site using a login or other access web page. Alternatively the access request from the third party application server includes user credentials such as a user name and password specifying a social networking website member. The social network host site then determines the user by authenticating the provided user credentials.

The social network host website also determines whether the third party application server is permitted to access data included in the user profile. As indicated above in conjunction with the data provided to the application server from the social network host site can include any data from the user profile as well as information from the user profiles of the user s friends. In one embodiment the data provided to the application server is limited to that data which is available pursuant to the user s privacy setting as well as in according to the privacy settings of the user s friends. In one embodiment this is implemented as follows. First the social network host site obtains all of the user data and data of the user s friends as described above in conjunction with . The social network host site then evaluates one or more privacy settings of the user profile of the requesting user to determine whether the data requested by the third party application server is able to be accessed by third parties. This allows the requesting user to regulate what data in the user profile is accessible by the third party application by modifying the privacy settings. Hence the third party application server is only able to access certain user selected data from the user profile. Similarly if the third party application server requests data from additional users such as the requesting user s friends the privacy settings of the additional users are examined. This prevents the third party application server from receiving information from the additional users that the additional users have not made publicly available. Thus while the social network host site allows the third party application server to access information associated with the requesting user from the social network host site the accessible information is limited by user privacy settings allowing different users to regulate the type and amount of information accessible by the third party application server . In sum the application content is both personalized to the current user and constrained by the privacy settings of the user and the user s friends.

If the social network host site determines that the third party application server is permitted to access user profile data of the requesting user the social network host site transmits the user identifier to the third party application server . In addition to providing the user identifier the social network host site also transmits a session key to the third party application server . The session key is uniquely associated with the particular user and session and is used to identify subsequent data exchanges between the social network host site and the third party application server . The session key is further described above in conjunction with . The third party application server then generates a result such as an output message using the data received from the social network host site .

In generating the result the third party application server may request additional data associated with the requesting user or other users associated with the requesting user from the social network host site . Such a request for additional data is described above in conjunction with . The generated result is then displayed by the third party application server . Alternatively the result is transmitted from the third party application server to the social network site host allowing the result to be displayed using an interface or display associated with the social network website. Hence a user may request an application using a third party application sever or using a social network host site and information maintained by the social network host site and associated with the requesting user is accessed by the third party application server . This allows the third party application sever to customize or personalize the information or service provided to the requesting user based on data from the social network host site .
