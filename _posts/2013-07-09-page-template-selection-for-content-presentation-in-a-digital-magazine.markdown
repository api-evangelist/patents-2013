This disclosure relates generally digital magazines and more particularly to dynamically determining a layout for presentation of content items in a digital magazine on a client device using flexible page templates.

Publishers of digital content struggle to optimize presentation of content on different devices with different display areas different display resolutions or differences in other display characteristics. Determining techniques for selecting content for a user and adapting the selected content for presentation to the user on a particular device create resource and performance challenges for a publisher. Additionally the rapidly increasing number and variety of devices used to present content makes it impractical for publishers to continue to create content layouts customized to individual devices. Moreover to maintain user engagement with content publishers must efficiently use computing resources to prevent optimization of content presentation from negatively impacting a user s viewing experience.

A digital magazine server creates a digital magazine for a user including content items for presentation to a user. The digital magazine server organizes content items having at least one common characteristic into various sections and presents content items to the user according to the sections. To improve user interaction with content items the digital magazine server maintains various page templates describing a spatial arrangement of content items relative to each other in a section layout for presentation to a user. A page template includes one or more display regions that are each configured to present one or more content items. The position of display regions relative to each other in a page template specify the position of content items relative to each other in a section generated from the page template.

One or more display regions in a page template may specify the size of content items displayed in a page of the digital magazine also referred to as a section using a percentage of a display area or a range of dimensions of a portion of the display area to specify the size of the content items displayed in a page. For example various display regions in a page template are associated with one or more dimensions specified as a percentage of a reference dimension such as a height or width specified as a percentage of a height or width of a display area in which a section is displayed. As another example a display region is associated with an aspect ratio specified as a percentage of a display area in which a section is displayed.

To allow greater customization in presentation of content items a display region of a page template may indicate that a sub template is used to present content items. A sub template includes one or more display regions that are each configured to present one or more content items. The position of display regions relative to each other in a page template specify the position of content items relative to each other in a section generated from the page template. A display region of a page template may identify a specific sub template that is used to determine the relative positioning and sizing information of content items presented via the display region. Alternatively a display region of a page template may indicate that content items in the display region are presented based on a sub template so a sub template is selected when the page template is selected and the selected sub template is used to present content items in the display region. Additionally a display region of a page template identifies a group of sub templates and a sub template is selected from the identified group when the page template is selected and used to present content items in the display region.

A user of the digital magazine server requests presentation of content items provided by one or more sources from the digital magazine server or from a digital magazine application executing on a client device. The request includes information describing the display area in which the section of the digital magazine is presented. For example the request includes the physical dimensions of the client device on which the section of the digital magazine is to be presented. Based in part on the display area one or more candidate page templates are selected. For example page templates having at least one display region with one or more physical dimensions less than a threshold value are not identified as candidate page templates. Hence page templates that would present content items using dimensions that would make viewing or interacting with the content items difficult are not identified as candidate page templates.

The candidate page templates may be scored based on the display area of the client device for presenting the section and ranked based on their associated scores. For example scores are based on characteristics of the content items to be presented characteristics of the display regions in various candidate page templates the display area in which the content items are to be presented as well as any other suitable data. For example the amount of modification of content items to present the content item in display regions of a candidate page template is reflected in a score for the candidate page template. Types of content items and associations between display regions in a candidate page template may also affect the scores of candidate page templates. Based at least in part on the ranking a page template is selected and used to present content items in the section. Additionally page template selection may account for other factors to present the user with content items presented using various page templates. In one embodiment scores associated with page templates are modified based on previous selection of page templates. For example a score associated with a page template is reduced if the page template was previously selected within a threshold time interval of the current time similarly a score associated with a page template is increased if the page template was previously selected greater than the threshold time interval of the current time. Characteristics of the content items to be presented and various page templates may also be used to modify a score associated with a page template. For example if the content items to be presented include at least one content item having a specified type a score associated with a page template including a single display region associated with the specified type of content item is increased. The ranking of page templates may be modified based on modified scores associated with page templates and a page template is selected from the modified ranking.

If the selected page template includes a display region identifying use of a sub template to present content items the sub template is selected and used to present content items in the corresponding display region. Various sub templates may be scored and a display sub template selected based on the scores. Methods for selecting a page template may be used to select the display sub template. If a specific sub template is identified by the display region of the selected page template rather than select a sub template based on scores associated with various sub templates the specific sub template is selected. Similarly if the display region of the selected page template identifies a group of sub templates the display sub template is selected from the identified group based on scores associated with sub templates in the group or based on any other suitable factor.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

A digital magazine server retrieves content from one or more sources and generates a personalized customizable digital magazine for a user based on the retrieved content. The generated digital magazine is retrieved by a digital magazine application executing on a computing device such as a mobile communication device a tablet computer or any other suitable computing system and presented to the user. For example based on selections made by the user or on behalf of the user the digital server application generates a digital magazine including one or more sections having content items retrieved from a number of sources and personalized for the user. The generated digital magazine allows the user to more easily consume content that interests and inspires the user by presenting content items in an easily navigable print style magazine interface via a computing device.

The digital magazine may be organized into a number of sections that each include content having a common characteristic e.g. content obtained from a particular source . For example a section of the digital magazine includes articles from an online news source such as a website for a news organization another section includes articles from a third party curated collection of content associated with a particular topic e.g. a technology compilation and an additional section includes content obtained from one or more accounts associated with the user and maintained by one or more social networking systems. For purposes of illustration content included in a section is referred to herein as content items or articles which may include textual articles pictures videos products for sale user generated content e.g. content posted on a social networking system advertisements and any other types of content capable of display within the context of a digital magazine.

A source is a computing system capable of providing various types of content to a client device . For purposes of illustration content provided by a source is also referred to herein as a content feed. Examples of content provided by a source include text images video or audio on web pages web feeds social networking information messages or other suitable data. Additional examples of content include user generated content such as blogs tweets shared images video or audio social networking posts and social networking status updates. Content provided by a source may be received from a publisher e.g. stories about news events product information entertainment or educational material and distributed by the source or a source may be a publisher of content it generates. For convenience content from a source regardless of its composition may be referred to herein as an article a content item or as content. A content item may include various types of content such as text images and video.

The sources communicate with the client device and the digital magazine server via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

The client device is one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment the client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively the client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone a tablet computer or another suitable device.

In one embodiment the client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the digital magazine server . For example an application executing on the client device communicates instructions or requests for content items to the digital magazine server to modify content presented to a user of the client device . As another example the client device executes a browser that receives pages from the digital magazine server and presents the pages to a user of the client device . In another embodiment the client device interacts with the digital magazine server through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID . While shows a single client device in various embodiments any number of client devices may communicate with the digital magazine server .

A display device included in the client device presents content items to a user of the client device . Examples of the display device include a liquid crystal display LCD an active matrix liquid crystal display AMLCD an organic light emitting diode OLED display or any other suitable device. Different client devices may have display devices with different characteristics. For example different client devices have display devices with different display areas different resolutions or differences in other characteristics.

One or more input devices included in the client device receive input from the user. Different input devices may be included in the client device . For example the client device includes a touch sensitive display for receiving input data commands or information from a user. Using a touch sensitive display allows the client device to combine the display device and an input device simplifying user interaction with presented content items. In other embodiments the client device may include a keyboard a trackpad a mouse or any other device capable of receiving input from a user. In another example the input device is configured to receive information from a user of the client device through a touchless interface. Examples of a touchless interface include sensors such as an image capture device to receive gestures from a client device user without the user physically contacting the display device or the client device . Additionally in some embodiments the client device may include multiple input devices . Inputs received via the input device may be processed by a digital magazine application associated with the digital magazine server and executing on the client device to allow a client device user to interact with content items presented by the digital magazine server .

The digital magazine server receives content items from one or more sources generates sections in a digital magazine by processing the received content and provides the sections to the client device . As further described below in conjunction with the digital magazine server generates one or more sections for presentation to a user based on content items obtained from one or more sources and information describing organization and presentation of content items. For example the digital magazine server determines a page layout specifying positioning of content items relative to each other based on information associated with a user and generates a section including the content items arranged according to the determined layout for presentation to the user via the client device . This allows the user to access content items via the client device in a format that enhances the user s interaction with and consumption of the content items. For example the digital magazine server provides a user with content items in a format similar to the format used by print magazines. By presenting content items in a format similar to a print magazine the digital magazine server reduces the amount of user interaction with the client device for accessing various content items.

Each user of the digital magazine server is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the digital magazine server . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding digital magazine server user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as gender hobbies or preferences location or other suitable information. A user profile in the user profile store also includes data describing interactions by a corresponding user with content items presented by the digital magazine server . For example a user profile includes a content item identifier a description of an interaction with the content item corresponding to the content item identifier and a time when the interaction occurred.

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to provide and receive content items via the digital magazine server user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to provide or access content items via the digital magazine server . An entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other content items associated with the entity to users of the digital magazine server . For example users of the digital magazine server may receive a digital magazine or section including content items associated with an entity via the digital magazine server .

The template store includes page templates each describing a spatial arrangement of content items relative to each other on a section layout for presentation by a client device . A page template includes one or more display regions each configured to present one or more content items. In some embodiments display regions in a page template may be configured to present a particular type of content item or to present a content item having one or more specified characteristics. For example a display region in a page template is configured to present an image while another display region in the page template is configured to present text data. Each display region has a size e.g. small medium or large and an aspect ratio. One or more page templates may be associated with types of client devices allowing content items to be presented in different relative locations and with different sizes when the content items are viewed using different client devices . Additionally page templates may be associated with sources allowing a source to specify the format of sections presenting content items received from the source . For example an online retailer is associated with a page template to allow the online retailer to present content items via the digital magazine server with a specific organization. Examples of page templates are further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 187 840 filed on Jul. 21 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In various embodiments page templates included in the template store may be defined with flexible dimensions allowing presentation of content items to account for various sizes or dimensions of a display area in which the content items are presented. For example a page template includes display regions specifying a percentage of a display area in which a content item is presented. Specifying a percentage of a display area for presentation of a content item allows a page template to present content items across a range of display areas and to provide consistent presentation of content items when a display area is resized. Page templates with display areas specified as percentages of a display area are further described below in conjunction with .

In some embodiments the template store includes one or more sub templates that specify positions of content items relative to each other. A sub template includes one or more display regions specifying sizing of content items and positioning of content items relative to each other. A display area in a page template may specify selection of a sub template for presentation of content items within the display area. For example a display region of a page template identifies a sub template allowing content items presented in the display region to be positioned relative to each other as specified by a sub template. To improve presentation of content items a sub template used to present content items in a display region is selected when a page template including the display region is presented. For example various sub templates in the template store are scored based on the display area in which content items are presented and characteristics of the content items to be presented. Based on the scores a display sub template is selected and used to present content items within the display region of the page template. This optimizes presentation of content items in the display region by selecting a sub template in which content items are displayed in a format that facilitates user interactions. Alternatively a source or a user of the digital magazine server associates a specific sub template with a display area of a template allowing the source or user to customize presentation of content items in a display area of the template. Use of sub templates to present content items is further described below in conjunction with .

The content store stores objects that each represents various types of content. For example the content store stores content items received from one or more sources within a threshold time of a current time. Examples of content items stored by the content store include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link an article a photograph video data or any other type of content. A user may specify a section including content items having a common characteristic and the common characteristic is stored in the content store along with an association with the user profile of the user specifying the section.

The layout engine retrieves content items from one or more sources or from the content store and generates a section including the content items based on a page template from the template store . Based on the retrieved content items the layout engine may identify candidate page templates from the template store score the candidate page templates based on characteristics of the display regions in different candidate page templates based on previously selected templates and based on characteristics of the content items. Based on the scores associated with candidate page templates the layout engine selects a page template and associates the retrieved content items with one or more display regions to generate a section where the retrieved content items are presented relative to each other and sized based on their associated display regions. The layout engine may use the display area of the client device on which content items are to be presented when selecting a page template from the candidate page templates. In some embodiments the layout engine enforces one or more diversification policies when selecting templates to provide the user with content items arranged based on different page templates. Use of diversification policies is further described below in conjunction with . When associating a content item with a display region the layout engine may associate the content item with a display region configured to present a specific type of content item or to present content items having one or more specified characteristics. An example of using a page template to present content items is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 187 840 filed on Jul. 21 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

If a display region of the selected template specifies a sub template the layout engine retrieves a specified sub template from the template store. Alternatively the layout engine scores various sub templates retrieved from the template store based on characteristics of the content items positioning and sizing of display regions within the sub templates and the display area of the client device on which the content items are to be presented. Based on the scores associated with various sub templates the layout engine selects a sub template specifying sizing and relative positioning of content items presented within the display region identifying the sub template.

The connection generator monitors interactions between users and content items presented by the digital magazine server . Based on the interactions the connection generator determines connections between various content items connections between users and content items or connections between users of the digital magazine server . For example the connection generator identifies when users of the digital magazine server provide feedback about a content item access a content item share a content item with other users or perform other actions with content items. In some embodiments the connection generator retrieves data describing user interaction with content items from the user s user profile in the user profile store . Alternatively user interactions with content items are communicated to the connection generator when the interactions are received by the digital magazine server . The connection generator may account for temporal information associated with user interactions with content items. For example the connection generator identifies user interactions with a content item within a specified time interval or applies a decay factor to identified user interactions based on times associated with interactions. The connection generator generates a connection between a user and a content item if the user s interactions with the content item satisfy one or more criteria. In one embodiment the connection generator determines one or more weights specifying a strength of the connection between the user and the content item based on user interactions with the content item that satisfy one or more criteria. Generation of connections between a user and a content item is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 905 016 filed on May 29 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

If multiple content items are connected to a user the connection generator establishes implicit connections between the content items connected to the user. In one embodiment the connection generator maintains a user content graph identifying the implicit connections between content items connected to a user. In one embodiment weights associated with connections between a user and content items are used to determine weights associated with various implicit connections between content items. User content graphs for multiple users of the digital magazine server are combined to generate a global content graph describing connections between various content items provided by the digital magazine server based on user interactions with various content items. For example the global content graph is generated by combining user content graphs based on mutual connections between various content items in user content graphs.

In one embodiment the connection generator generates an adjacency matrix from the global content graph or from multiple user content graphs and stores the adjacency matrix in the connection store . The adjacency matrix describes connections between content items. For example the adjacency matrix includes identifiers of content items and weights representing the strength or closeness of connections between content items based on the global content graph. As an example the weights indicate a degree of similarity in subject matter or similarity of other characteristics associated with various content items. In other embodiments the connection store includes various adjacency matrices determined from various user content graphs the adjacency matrices may be analyzed to generate an overall adjacency matrix for content items provided by the digital magazine server . Graph analysis techniques may be applied to the adjacency matrix to rank content items to recommend content items to a user or to otherwise analyze relationships between content items. An example of the adjacency matrix is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 905 016 filed on May 29 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In addition to identifying connections between content items the connection generator may also determine a social proximity between users of the digital magazine server based on interactions between users and content items. In one embodiment the connection generator determines a connection confidence value between a user and an additional user of the digital magazine server based on the user s and the additional user s interactions with content items. The connection confidence value may be a numerical score representing a measure of closeness between the user and the additional user. For example a larger connection confidence value indicates a greater similarity between the user and the additional user. In one embodiment if a user has at least a threshold connection confidence value with another user the digital magazine server stores a connection between the user and the additional user in the connection store .

Using data from the connection store the recommendation engine identifies content items from one or more sources for recommending to a digital magazine server user. Hence the recommendation engine identifies content items potentially relevant to a user. In one embodiment the recommendation engine retrieves data describing interactions between a user and content items from the user s user profile and data describing connections between content items and or connections between users from the connection store . In one embodiment the recommendation engine uses stored information describing content items e.g. topic sections subsections and interactions between users and various content items e.g. views shares saved links topics read or recent activities to identify content items that may be relevant to a digital magazine server user. For example content items having an implicit connection of at least a threshold weight to a content item with which the user interacted are recommended to the user. As another example a the recommendation engine presents a user with content items having one or more attributes in common with a content item with which an additional user having a threshold connection confidence score with the user interacted. Recommendations for additional content items may be presented to a user when the user views a content item using the digital magazine may be presented as a notification to the user by the digital magazine server or may be presented to the user through any suitable communication channel.

In one embodiment the recommendation engine applies various filters to content items received from one or more sources or from the content store to efficiently provide a user with recommended content items. For example the recommendation engine analyzes attributes of content items in view of characteristics of a user retrieved from the user s user profile. Example attributes of content items include a type e.g. image story link video audio etc. a source from which a content item was received time when a content item was retrieved and subject matter of a content item. Example characteristics of a user include biographic information about the user users connected to the user and interactions between the user and content items. In one embodiment the recommendation engine analyzes attributes of content items in view of a user s characteristics for a specified time period to generate a set of recommended content items. The set of recommended content items may be presented to the user or may be further analyzed based on user characteristics and on content item attributes to generate more refined set of recommended content items. A setting included in a user s user profile may specify a length of time that content items are analyzed before identifying recommended content items to the user allowing a user to balance refinement of recommended content items with time used to identify recommended content items.

The search module receives a search query from a user and retrieves content items from one or more sources based on the search query. For example content items having at least a portion of an attribute matching at least a portion of a search query are retrieved from one or more sources . The user may specify sources from which content items are received through settings maintained by the user s user profile or by identifying one or more sources in the search query. In one embodiment the search module generates a section of the digital magazine including the content items identified based on the search query as the identified content items have a common attribute of their association with the search query. Presenting identified content items identified from a search query allows a user to more easily identify additional content items at least partially matching the search query when additional content items are provided by sources .

To more efficiently identify content items based on search queries the search module may index content items from various sources groups or sections of content items and user profile information. In one embodiment the index includes information about various content items such as author source topic creation date time user interaction information document title or other information capable of uniquely identifying the content item. Search queries are compared to information maintained in the index to identify content items for presentation to a user. The search module may present identified content items based on a ranking. One or more factors associated with the content items may be used to generate the ranking. Examples of factors include global popularity of a content item among users of the digital magazine server connections between users interacting with a content item and the user providing the search query and information from a source . Additionally the search module may assign a weight to the index information associated with each content item selected based on similarity between the index information and a search query and rank the content items based on their weights. For example content items identified based on a search query are presented in a section of the digital magazine in an order based in part on the ranking of the content items.

To increase user interaction with the digital magazine the interface generator maintains instructions associating received input with actions performed by the digital magazine server or by a digital magazine application executing on a client device . For example instructions maintained by the interface generator associate types of inputs or specific inputs received via an input device of a client device with modifications to content presented by a digital magazine. As an example if the input device is a touch sensitive display the interface generator includes instructions associating different gestures with navigation through content items presented by a digital magazine. Instructions from the interface generator are communicated to a digital magazine application or other application executing on a client device on which content from the digital magazine server is presented. Inputs received via an input device of the client device are processed based on the instructions when content items are presented via the digital magazine server is presented to simplify user interaction with content presented by the digital magazine server .

The web server links the digital magazine server via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more sources . The web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may retrieve content item from one or more sources . Additionally the web server communicates instructions for generating sections of content items from the layout engine and instructions for processing received input from the interface generator to a client device for presentation to a user. The web server also receives requests for content or other information from a client device and communicates the request or information to components of the digital magazine server to perform corresponding actions. Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or RIM .

For purposes of illustration describes various functionalities provided by the digital magazine server . However in other embodiments the above described functionality may be provided by a digital magazine application executing on a client device or may be provided by a combination of the digital magazine server and a digital magazine application executing on a client device . For example the digital magazine server generates a user defined section of the digital magazine including content items satisfying a search query provided by a user and sends the user defined section to the client device for presentation to one or more users. In another example a digital magazine application executing on the client device receives a search query from the user and generates the user defined section of the digital magazine. Alternatively the digital magazine server and the client device operate in conjunction with each other to generate the user defined section of the digital magazine. For example certain functionality e.g. identifying content items from sources satisfying a search query is performed by the digital magazine server while other functionality e.g. selecting a template for presenting a user defined section of the digital magazine is performed by a digital magazine application executing on the client device .

Additionally display regions in a page template may be specified hierarchically where a display region identifies a sub template from the template store specifying location and sizing information for content items presented in the display region. As described above a sub template includes one or more display regions that specify sizing and positioning of content items relative to each other and a display region in a sub template may identify a sub template for presenting content items. This allows greater customization of presentation of content items in a digital magazine. For example a page template is organized hierarchically where display regions within the page template identify sub templates for presenting content items. A seven column page template for example may be divided into two sub templates e.g. 4 column and 3 column sub templates 5 column and 2 column sub templates 6 column and 1 column sub templates etc. or any suitable number of sub templates arranged in permutations of seven columns.

In the example of when a digital magazine server generates a section for presentation to a user the digital magazine server populates display regions in a page template with content items. Information identifying the page template and associations between content items and display regions in the page template is stored and used to generate the section. For example to present a section to a user the layout engine identifies the page template from the template store and retrieves content items from one or more sources or from the content store . The layout engine generates data or instructions associating content items with display regions within the page template . Hence the generated section includes various content regions presenting one or more content items associated with a display region in a location specified by the display region.

A content region may present image data text data a combination of image and text data or any other information retrieved from a corresponding content item. For example in the content region A represents a table of contents identifying sections of a digital magazine and content associated with the various sections are presented in content regions B H. For example content region A includes text or other data indicating that the presented data is a table of contents such the text Cover Stories Featuring followed by one or more identifiers associated with various sections of the digital magazine. In one embodiment an identifier associated with a section describes a characteristic common to at least a threshold number of content items in the section. For example an identifier refers to the name of a user of social network from which content items included in the section are received. As another example an identifier associated with a section specifies a topic an author a publisher e.g. a newspaper a magazine or other characteristic associated with at least a threshold number of content items in the section. Additionally an identifier associated with a section may further specify content items selected by a user of the digital magazine server and organized as a section. Content items included in a section may be related topically and include text and or images related to the topic.

Sections may be further organized into subsections with content items associated with one or more subsections presented in content regions. Information describing sections or subsections such as a characteristic common to content items in a section or subsection may be stored in the content store and associated with a user profile to simplify generation of a section or subsection for the user. A page template associated with a subsection may be identified and display regions in the page template associated with the subsection used to determine presentation of content items from the subsection relative to each other. Referring to the content region H includes a content item associated with a newspaper to indicate a section including content items retrieved from the newspaper. When a user interacts with the content region a page template associated with the section is retrieved as well as content items associated with the section. Based on the page template associated with the section and the content items the digital magazine server generates a section presenting the content items based on the layout described by the display regions of the page template. For example in the section includes content regions presenting content items associated with the section. The content regions may include content items associated with various subsections including content items having one or more common characteristics e.g. topics authors etc. . Hence a subsection may include one or more subsections allowing hierarchical organization and presentation of content items by a digital magazine.

In one embodiment display regions in a page template are associated with a percentage of a display area to specify the size of the content items displayed in a section. For example various display regions are associated with one or more dimensions specified as a percentage of a reference dimension such as a height or width specified as a percentage of a height or width of a display area in which a section is displayed. As another example a display region is associated with an aspect ratio specified as a percentage of the display area in which a section is displayed. Specifying the size of display regions as a percentage of a display area allows the size of the content items displayed based on the display regions to be easily modified as the display area changes in size. Additionally one or more display regions in a page template may have fixed dimensions so the size of content items presented based on fixed dimension display regions remains unchanged as the display area presenting the section changes in size.

The digital magazine server or a digital magazine application executing on a client device receives a request to present content items from one or more sources via a digital magazine. Information describing the display area of the client device is included in the request. For example physical dimensions of a display device of the client device are included in the request. In some embodiments information describing the resolution of the display device is included in the received request. The request may additionally include information identifying one or more characteristics of the content items for presentation. Example characteristics of the one or more content items include one or more source identifiers a keyword associated with the content items a user associated with the content items and a time interval associated with the content items.

Based at least in part on the display area of the client device one or more candidate page templates are selected from the stored page templates. For example using information in the received request to present content items physical dimensions for display regions in each of the stored page templates are determined page templates having at least one display region with one or more physical dimensions less than a threshold value are not identified as candidate page templates. Hence page templates that would present content items using dimensions that would make viewing or interacting with the content items difficult are not identified as candidate page templates. As another example various page templates partition a display area into one or more columns each of the various page templates is compared to information about the display area from the received requests. The columns may be specified using percentages of the display area or using specified physical dimensions. Page templates having a number of columns capable of being presented in the display area with at least a threshold physical size are selected as candidate page templates while page templates having one or more columns not capable of being presented in the display area with at least the threshold physical size are not selected as candidate page templates. For example a display area may be unable to present more than 5 columns that each have a threshold physical size so page templates including more than 5 columns are not selected as candidate page templates while page templates with 5 or fewer columns are selected as candidate page templates. In one embodiment a digital magazine application executing on the client device from which the request to present content items was received selects the candidate page templates after retrieving page templates from the digital magazine server or from a storage device local to the client device alternatively the digital magazine server selects the candidate page templates from the template store .

From the candidate page templates a display page template is selected . As further described below in conjunction with scores are generated for each of the candidate page templates and a page template is selected based at least in part on the scores. In various embodiments the scores are based on characteristics of the content items to be presented characteristics of the display regions in various candidate page templates the display area of the display device on which the content items are to be presented as well as any other suitable data. For example the amount of modification of content items to present the content item in display regions of a candidate page template is reflected in a score for the candidate page template. Types of content items and associations between display regions in a candidate page template and content item types may also influence the score of the candidate page template. Diversity of page templates may be enforced when selecting a page template as further described below in conjunction with . For example scores of specific candidate page templates are increased or decreased based on how recently they were selected or based on characteristics of the candidate page templates or display regions within the candidate page templates.

Using the display page template the digital magazine server or a digital magazine application executing on the client device generates a section including the content items from one or more sources . The generated section includes content regions presenting one or more content items having locations relative to each other specified by the display regions in the selected page template. Additionally the sizes of various content regions are determined from the sizes of display regions in the selected page template from which a corresponding content region is generated. In one embodiment the digital magazine server or a digital magazine application executing on the client device dynamically arranges and sizes one or more content regions including one or more content items relative to each other based on the selected page template.

In one embodiment a size of a content region is modified based on the location of the content region within the display area if the content region presents a content item having a specified type. For example if a content region is displaying an image and is within a threshold distance of a boundary of the display area the content region is increased to a size where a border of the content region is within the threshold distance of the display area boundary. Increasing the size of certain content regions based on the type of presented content items allows users to more easily view or interact with certain content items increasing user interaction with content items presented via the digital magazine.

As further described in conjunction with after the section is generated and presented to a user via the client device the size of display area available for presenting the section may be modified. For example the section is displayed in a window of a laptop computer and a user or application modifies the size of the window displaying the section. Information including the modified size of the display area is communicated to a digital magazine application executing on the client device which selects candidate page templates as described above based on the modified size of the display area. A page template is selected and used to generate a modified section based on the modified size of the display area as described above. Hence the layout of a section may be dynamically modified as the display area available for presenting the section is modified increasing user engagement with the presented content items.

In one embodiment the presentation of a content item is modified based on the size of a content region of the selected page template for displaying the particular content item. For example if the text to be included in a content region is greater than a threshold area of a content region of a selected template the text is reduced to a size where the entire text can be displayed within the target content region of the selected template. Known techniques for modifying attributes of a content item may be employed to reduced text an image video or other content items such that the modified content item is suitable for presentation in a target content region. Using the selected page template the digital magazine server presents a section that includes the modified content item along with any selected unmodified content items. Modifying the size of certain content items based on the area of the target content region in a selected template allows the digital magazine server to make a rough selection of a page template and then modify the size of the content item based on the area of a target content region. In turn the digital magazine server can more easily select a page template and generate a section based on the selected template.

For example as shown in presentation of content items as a display area dimension is modified is based on the page template selected for presentation of the content items. For example a selected page template redistributes content items from their initial display regions F G H and I to alternative display regions J K L and M when a display area dimension is modified. In another embodiment the selected page template hides content items within one or more display regions from view when a display area dimension is modified as shown in . Alternatively the digital magazine server or an application executing on the client device and associated with the digital magazine server selects an additional page template for presenting additional content items if a display area dimension is modified e.g. if a display area dimension is increased . This allows dynamic modification of a section s layout based on modifications to the display area available for presenting the section presenting content items in a layout best suited to increase user engagement with the content items.

The candidate page templates are ranked based on their associated score. For example candidate page templates having a higher score have a higher position in the ranking. The ranking of candidate page templates is modified based on one or more characteristics of the candidate page template to increase the likelihood of diverse page templates being used to present content items. For example the scores of one or more candidate page templates are modified based on characteristics of the candidate page templates and the modified scores are used to modify the position of various candidate page templates in the ranking. This allows the digital magazine to provide a diverse presentation of content items to increase the likelihood of users accessing or interacting with the digital magazine.

For example a score associated with a candidate page templates are modified based on a time interval when the candidate page template was previously used to present content items. In one embodiment a candidate page template s score is reduced if the candidate page template was previously selected within a threshold time interval of a current time. The candidate page template s score may be reduced by an amount that is inversely proportional to the time interval between the current time and a prior selection of the candidate page template for content item presentation. For example scores of candidate page templates selected within a threshold time interval from the current time are reduced by a greater amount than scores of candidate page templates selected greater than the threshold time interval. Similarly scores of candidate page templates previously selected greater than a threshold time interval from the current time may be increased which places these candidate page templates in a higher position within the ranking and increases the likelihood of their selection.

Additional characteristics of a candidate page template may be used to modify a score associated with the candidate page template which modifies its position within the ranking. For example scores associated with candidate page templates having a specified number of display regions or less than a threshold number of content regions are increased and the ranking is modified accordingly. As another example if the content items to be presented include at least one content item having a specified type a score associated with a page template including a single display region associated with the specified type of content item is increased hence a page template including a single display region for presenting an image may have its score increased to modify its position in the ranking increasing the likelihood of its selection if content items to be presented include at least one image.

Additionally the ranking may be modified based on a sequence of page templates provided by a source or by the user being presented with the content items. For example the sequence of page templates identifies an order for selecting page templates for presentation so a score associated with the initial page template in the sequence is increased to raise its position in the ranking and to increase the likelihood of its selection. After the initial page template is selected an indication that the initial page template was selected is generated and a score associated subsequent page template in the sequence of page templates is increased when a subsequent request to present content items is received by the digital magazine server or by a digital magazine application executing on a client device . This allows a user or a source to customize presentation of content items to the user.

From the modified ranking a page template is selected from the candidate page template. As described above in conjunction with a section displaying the one or more content items is generated using the selected candidate page template. While various examples of modifying a ranking of candidate page templates are provided above in conjunction with any suitable method for modifying the ranking may be used. For example rather than modifying the scores associated with various candidate page templates the position of various page templates in the ranking may be modified while the scores associated with the page templates remain unchanged.

One or more page templates as described above in conjunction with are stored in the template store or in a local storage device included in a client device . As described above in conjunction with a page template includes one or more display regions each configured to present one or more content items and describing a spatial arrangement of content items relative to each other on a section layout for presentation by a client device . The position of display regions relative to each other in a page template specify the position of content items relative to each other in a section generated from the page template. Similarly the size of a display region in a page template indicates the size with which a content item is presented.

A page template may include a display region that identifies a sub template to present content items within the display region according to the relative positioning and sizing specified by the identified sub template. In one embodiment a display region of a page template identifies a specific sub template when a section is generated using the page template content items included in the display region are presented using relative positioning and sizing information in the specific sub template. Alternatively a display region of a page template identifies that content items in the display region are presented based on a sub template when the page template is selected a sub template is selected from the sub template and the selected sub template is used to present content items. In another embodiment a display region of a page template identifies a group of sub templates when the page template is selected a sub template from the identified group is selected and content items are presented in the display region based on positioning and sizing information included in the selected sub template.

The digital magazine server or a digital magazine application executing on a client device receives a request to present content items from one or more sources via a digital magazine. Information describing the display area of the client device is included in the request as described above in conjunction with . For example physical dimensions of a display device of the client device are included in the request.

Based at least in part on the display area of the client device a page template is selected from the stored page templates. Selection of page templates is further described above in conjunction with . For example candidate page templates are identified based at least in part on the display area of the client device and each candidate page template is scored based on characteristics of the candidate page templates characteristics of the one or more content items and the display area. Based on the scores a display page template is selected from the candidate page templates.

If the selected page template includes a display region identifying a sub template a display sub template is selected from the stored sub templates. If the display region in the selected page template identifies a specific sub template the specific sub template is selected . However if the display region in the selected page template indicates use of a sub template to present content items at least a subset of the stored sub templates are ranked based on the display area of the client device and characteristics of the one or more content items to be presented. For example each stored sub templates are scored based on the amount of modification to one or more content items to present the content items in display regions of a sub template and the sub templates are ranked based on their scores. A sub template is selected based on the ranking. In some embodiments the display region in the selected page template identifies a group of sub templates so a sub template is selected from the identified group of sub templates for example each sub template in the group is scored and a display sub template is selected from the group based on the scores. The methods for selecting a page template described above in conjunction with may similarly be used to select a display sub template.

Using the selected page template and display sub template the digital magazine server or a digital magazine application executing on the client device generates a section including the content items from one or more sources . As described above in conjunction with the generated section includes content regions presenting one or more content items having locations relative to each other specified by the display regions in the selected page template. Similarly a content region corresponding to the display region identifying use of a sub template for content item presentation includes sub content regions having relative positioning and sizing specified by display regions in the selected sub template. As described above in conjunction with if the display area in which the generated section is modified an alternative page template and display sub template may be selected using the above described method and the modified display area allowing presentation of content items to be dynamically modified as the display area changes.
