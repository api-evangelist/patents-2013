In the digital age organizations increasingly depend on computing resources to manage data and to provide internal and external services. In order to manage increasingly complex information technology infrastructures some organizations may use platform as a service platforms for deploying applications. The platform as a service model may allow organizations to bring applications online without acquiring configuring or maintaining the underlying hardware and software stack.

Delegating the maintenance of a computing platform to a third party may save an organization time may save the organization money and or may increase the flexibility with which the organization may select resources for and allocate resources to applications. Unfortunately by outsourcing computing platforms the same organization may reduce its control over the computing platforms preventing the organization from applying security policies and other compliance policies not provided for by the platform as a service provider.

Some traditional platform as a service platforms may allow administrators to launch computing instances with specified roles that are associated with permissions to access specified data sets. For example an administrator may launch a computing instance that is granted credentials to access a cloud stored database of credit card data but is not granted credentials to access a cloud stored database of medical data or vice versa . However some organizations may employ multiple administrators with separate organizational roles and therefore responsibility over differing datasets. Unfortunately traditional platform as a service platforms may allow all administrators in an organization to launch a computing instance with any or all available permissions and or allow administrators to access data outside the scope of their responsibilities.

Accordingly the instant disclosure identifies and addresses a need for additional and improved systems and methods for enforcing enterprise data access control policies in cloud computing environments.

As will be described in greater detail below the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for enforcing enterprise data access control policies in cloud computing environments by intercepting and inspecting management traffic into a cloud computing platform at a network proxy. These systems and methods may determine whether to allow or block attempts by users within an enterprise to configure computing instances on the cloud computing platform by examining permissions to be granted to the computing instances which users are attempting to provision the computing instances with the permissions and the roles of the users in the enterprise.

In one example a computer implemented method for enforcing enterprise data access control policies in cloud computing environments may include 1 intercepting at a proxy an attempt to configure a computing instance on a cloud computing platform with a permission that would provide the computing instance with access to secured data on the cloud computing platform 2 identifying a user within an enterprise that initiated the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission 3 determining based on a data access control policy for the enterprise that the user is not entitled to access the secured data and 4 blocking the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission based on determining that the user is not entitled to access the secured data.

In one embodiment the computer implemented method may further include retrieving at the proxy the data access control policy from the enterprise. In some examples identifying the user within the enterprise that initiated the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission may include extracting at the proxy an identifier of the user from the attempt to configure the computing instance. In some examples determining that the user is not entitled to access the secured data may include extracting at the proxy an identifier of the permission from the attempt to configure the computing instance.

In one embodiment the computer implemented method may further include 1 identifying subsequent to blocking the attempt an additional user within the enterprise that is entitled to access the secured data 2 initiating a request to the additional user to approve the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission that would provide the computing instance with access to secured data on the cloud computing platform 3 receiving in response to the request approval from the additional user to configure the computing instance with the permission and 4 forwarding the attempt to configure the computing instance to the cloud computing platform.

In one embodiment the user may be entitled to configure the computing instance on the cloud computing platform without the permission. In addition the computer implemented method may further include 1 intercepting at the proxy an additional attempt to configure an additional computing instance on the cloud computing platform with the permission 2 identifying an additional user within the enterprise that initiated the additional attempt to configure the additional computing instance 3 determining based on the data access control policy for the enterprise that the additional user is entitled to access the secured data and 4 allowing the attempt to configure the additional computing instance with the permission based on determining that the additional user is entitled to access the secured data.

In one embodiment determining based on the data access control policy for the enterprise that the user is not entitled to access the secured data may include 1 identifying a cloud side role that is defined on the cloud computing platform as having access to the permission 2 identifying an enterprise side role pertaining to the user 3 identifying a role map that maps enterprise side roles to cloud side roles and 4 determining based on the role map that the enterprise side role is not mapped to the cloud side role.

In one embodiment a system for implementing the above described method may include 1 an interception module stored in memory that intercepts at a proxy an attempt to configure a computing instance on a cloud computing platform with a permission that would provide the computing instance with access to secured data on the cloud computing platform 2 an identification module stored in memory that identifies a user within an enterprise that initiated the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission 3 a determination module stored in memory that determines based on a data access control policy for the enterprise that the user is not entitled to access the secured data 4 a blocking module stored in memory that blocks the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission based on determining that the user is not entitled to access the secured data and 5 at least one processor configured to execute the interception module the identification module the determination module and the blocking module.

In some examples the above described method may be encoded as computer readable instructions on a non transitory computer readable medium. For example a computer readable medium may include one or more computer executable instructions that when executed by at least one processor of a computing device may cause the computing device to 1 intercept at a proxy an attempt to configure a computing instance on a cloud computing platform with a permission that would provide the computing instance with access to secured data on the cloud computing platform 2 identify a user within an enterprise that initiated the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission 3 determine based on a data access control policy for the enterprise that the user is not entitled to access the secured data and 4 block the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission based on determining that the user is not entitled to access the secured data.

As illustrated in at step one or more of the systems described herein may intercept at a proxy an attempt to configure a computing instance on a cloud computing platform with a permission that would provide the computing instance with access to secured data on the cloud computing platform. For example at step interception module may as part of proxy in intercept at a proxy attempt to configure computing instance on cloud computing platform with permission that would provide computing instance with access to secured data on cloud computing platform .

The term proxy as used herein may refer to any computing system that acts as an intermediary between at least two other computing systems and or networks. For example a proxy may act as an intermediary between an enterprise and a cloud computing platform. In one embodiment interception module may be hosted on a proxy server which acts as an intermediary between the enterprise and the cloud computing platform. In this example management traffic including e.g. attempts to launch and or configure computing instances with specified permissions and or roles to access secured data stored on the cloud computing platform directed to the cloud computing platform from the enterprise may be required to pass through the proxy.

As used herein the phrase computing instance may refer to any unit of computational resources that may be provided by a cloud computing platform and that may store and or access data stored on the cloud computing platform. In some examples the phrase computing instance may correspond to a virtual machine provisioned within the cloud computing service e.g. onto which a user may install one or more applications that may store data on the cloud computing platform . As used herein the phrase virtual machine generally refers to any operating system environment that is abstracted from computing hardware by a virtual machine manager e.g. a hypervisor . Examples of computing instances include without limitation AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD EC2 instances and VMWARE VCENTER virtual machines.

Examples of cloud computing platforms include without limitation Platform as a Service PaaS systems Software as a Service SaaS systems and Infrastructure as a Service IaaS systems. In some examples a cloud computing platform may provide third party storage e.g. including e.g. secured storage as well as the ability to launch computing instances that may access stored data. In some examples a cloud computing platform may allow an enterprise to specify roles for accessing specified datasets. The cloud computing platform may enable an enterprise to launch computing instances with selected roles to enable the computing instances to access corresponding datasets. Examples of cloud computing services may include without limitation AMAZON WEB SERVICES AWS with e.g. AMAZON S3 and or AMAZON RDS as storage services and VMWARE VSPHERE.

The term permission as used herein generally refers to any rule and or criterion for determining access to a resource. In some examples the permission may include a role assignable to computing instances by the cloud computing platform. For example the cloud computing platform may allow computing instances assigned with a given role to access resources e.g. storage instances pertaining to the role. In some examples the cloud computing platform may maintain credentials required for accessing resources and invoke the credentials on behalf of computing instances with the appropriate roles. For example the cloud computing platform may allow an organization to assign one or more computing instances a financial role. The organization may associate the financial role with one or more datasets stored and or accessible by the cloud computing platform including e.g. a dataset that stores credit card information. Accordingly by configuring a computing instance with the financial role an administrator may configure the computing instance with a permission to access the dataset that stores the credit card information.

Interception module may intercept the attempt in any of a variety of contexts. For example interception module may intercept the attempt on a proxy system configured to intercept network traffic leaving a computing environment that includes an administration system for the cloud computing platform. The administration system may include any system for launching and or configuring computing instances and or remotely initiating the launching and or configuration of computing instances on the cloud computing platform. The computing environment may include any of a variety of computing configurations. For example the computing environment may include an enterprise network e.g. connected to a wide area network by a router and or gateway with the wide area network connecting the enterprise network to the cloud computing platform . Additionally or alternatively the computing environment may include one or more computing devices under the control of a subscriber to the cloud computing platform.

Returning to at step one or more of the systems described herein may identify a user within an enterprise that initiated the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission. For example at step identification module may as part of proxy in identify user within enterprise that initiated attempt to configure computing instance with permission .

The term enterprise as used herein generally refers to any organization and or computing environment maintained and or controlled by an organization e.g. a computing network . For example an enterprise may include a networked computing environment controlled by an organization and operated by multiple administrators. In some examples the organization may use a cloud computing platform to store data and or execute computing instances. The administrators of the organization may accordingly configure and or launch computing instances on behalf of the organization. In some examples the administrators may have different roles within the organization and therefore may have different responsibilities and different access privileges to data controlled by the organization e.g. both data stored within the enterprise and stored on the cloud computing platform . As will be explained in greater detail below the systems described herein may help to ensure that each administrator may only launch and or configure computing instances on the cloud computing platform with permissions to access data that is under the purview of that administrator.

The term user as used herein generally refers to any user user account and or administrator within an enterprise. In some examples the term user may refer to an account that an enterprise administrator has with a cloud computing platform that enables the administrator to access the cloud computing platform on behalf of the enterprise. In some examples the user may be entitled to configure the computing instance on the cloud computing platform without the permission. For example the cloud computing platform may allow the user to launch computing instances for the enterprise on the cloud computing platform e.g. because an enterprise has provided the administrator with access to an account tied to the enterprise on the cloud computing platform . Additionally the cloud computing platform may be configured to allow the user to configure and launch computing instances with the permission although the user may not be allowed to access data corresponding to the permission according to enterprise policies.

Identification module may identify the user within the enterprise that initiated the attempt to configure the computing instance in any of a variety of ways. For example identification module may identify the user by extracting at the proxy an identifier of the user from the attempt to configure the computing instance. For example the attempt may include information identifying the user to the cloud computing platform and identification module may extract the information identifying the user from the attempt. Additionally or alternatively identification module may identify an origin of the attempt from within the enterprise and determine the identity of the user based on the origin of the attempt. Using as an example identification module may as a part of proxy identify user as having initiated the attempt to configure computing instance on cloud computing platform .

Returning to at step one or more of the systems described herein may determine based on a data access control policy for the enterprise that the user is not entitled to access the secured data. For example at step determination module may as part of proxy in determine based on data access control policy for the enterprise that user is not entitled to access secured data .

The phrase data access control policy as used herein may refer to any information indicating what type of data a user and or administrator is allowed to access control and or enable a computing instance on a cloud computing platform to access. In some examples the data access control policy may include information indicating a role of the user and or administrator within an enterprise and or one or more data classifications describing data that the user and or administrator is allowed to access e.g. within an enterprise .

Determination module may identify the data access control policy in any of a variety of ways. For example determination module may retrieve at the proxy the data access control policy from the enterprise. In some examples determination module may store the data access control policy at the proxy. In one example determination module may enable a security administrator to define the data access control policy for the user and e.g. for other users that may attempt to configure computing instances on the cloud computing platform from and or on behalf of the enterprise .

In some examples determination module may extract at the proxy an identifier of the permission from the attempt to configure the computing instance. In addition in some examples determination module may access information describing data that is accessible via the permission. For example determination module may request classification information relating to the data from the cloud computing platform e.g. via an application programming interface . Additionally or alternatively determination module may receive classification information relating to the data from a data loss prevention system. In this example the data loss prevention system and or determination module acting as a part of a data loss prevention system may monitor scan analyze and or parse the data that is accessible via the permission and classify the data e.g. based on one or more keywords and or regular expressions found within the data . For example the data loss prevention system may determine a sensitivity level of the data that is accessible via the permission and or compliance policies invoked by the data. Examples of such compliance policies may include policies for ensuring compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI DSS the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and the like.

In some examples determination module identify classification information derived from analyzing user activity in connection with the data that is accessible via the permission. For example determination module may determine which users access the data and how frequently they access the data to determine which users have legitimate access to the data.

Determination module may determine that the user is not entitled to access the secured data in any of a variety of ways. For example determination module may determine that the data access control policy restricts the user s access to data of the type made accessible by the permission.

In one example determination module may determine that the user is not entitled to access the secured data by 1 identifying a cloud side role that is defined on the cloud computing platform as having access to the permission 2 identifying an enterprise side role pertaining to the user 3 identifying a role map that maps enterprise side roles to cloud side roles and 4 determining based on the role map that the enterprise side role is not map to the cloud side role. For example determination module may determine that the attempt to configure the computing instance includes provisioning the computing instance with a cloud side role of medical data application. Determination module may also identify an enterprise side role that defines the role of the user in an enterprise as financial data administrator. Determination module may then consult a role may that maps the enterprise side role financial data administrator with the cloud side role financial data application and the enterprise side role medical data administrator with the cloud side role medical data application. Because financial data administrator does not map to medical data application determination module may determine that the user is not entitled to access the secured data.

Using as an example determination module may as a part of proxy determine that user is not allowed to configure the computing instance with instance role on cloud computing platform based on a role of user within enterprise not entitling user to access secured data .

Returning to at step one or more of the systems described herein may block the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission based on determining that the user is not entitled to access the secured data. For example at step blocking module may as part of proxy in block attempt to configure computing instance with permission based on determining that user is not entitled to access secured data .

Blocking module may block the attempt to configure the computing instance in any suitable manner. For example blocking module may simply not forward the attempt along to the cloud computing platform. In some examples blocking module may block the attempt by modifying the attempt and forwarding the modified instruction to the cloud computing platform e.g. to configure the computing instance but without the permission . In some examples blocking module may return a message advising the user that the attempt has been blocked. Additionally or alternatively blocking module may alert a security administrator that the attempt has been blocked and e.g. identifying the user and or the permission .

In one example blocking module may 1 identify subsequent to blocking the attempt an additional user within the enterprise that is entitled to access the secured data 2 initiate a request to the additional user to approve the attempt to configure the computing instance with the permission that would provide the computing instance with access to secured data on the cloud computing platform 3 receive in response to the request approval from the additional user to configure the computing instance with the permission and 4 forward the attempt to configure the computing instance to the cloud computing platform. In this manner the attempt may ultimately result in configuring the computing instance on the cloud computing platform.

Using as an example blocking module may block the attempt by user to configure computing instance with instance role on cloud computing platform . Blocking module may then at step send a request to a user within enterprise to approve the attempt e.g. because user has a role within enterprise that gives user access to data such as secured data . At step user may approve the attempt. Accordingly at step proxy may forward the attempt to cloud computing platform which may then configure computing instance with instance role giving computing instance access to secured data .

In one example the systems described herein may 1 intercept at the proxy an additional attempt to configure an additional computing instance on the cloud computing platform with the permission 2 identify an additional user within the enterprise that initiated the additional attempt to configure the additional computing instance 3 determine based on the data access control policy for the enterprise that the additional user is entitled to access the secured data and 4 allow the attempt to configure the additional computing instance with the permission based on determining that the additional user is entitled to access the secured data. In this manner the systems described herein may selectively allow users within an enterprise to configure computing instances with permissions.

As explained above in connection with method in by determining whether to allow or block attempts by users within an enterprise to configure computing instances on the cloud computing platform by examining permissions to be granted to the computing instances which users are attempting to provision the computing instances with the permissions and the roles of the users in the enterprise the systems and methods described herein may allow an enterprise to ensure that administrators do not access and or control cloud stored data outside the scope of their roles in the enterprise. Furthermore by intercepting and inspecting management traffic into a cloud computing platform at a network proxy these systems and methods may enable an enterprise to achieve the above with a variety of cloud computing platforms and without requiring changes to the cloud computing platforms which e.g. may be out of the control of an organization wishing to manage permissions in a cloud computing context .

For example applications running in cloud computing instances e.g. EC2 instances on a cloud computing platform e.g. AWS may be provisioned with credentials with access to cloud storage services. A policy broker may inspect all management traffic into the cloud computing platform through a network proxy. The policy broker may extract identity and access management IAM roles out of AWS. The policy broker may also acquire classifications of data in cloud data services such as AMAZON S3. The policy broker may acquire these classifications from the cloud computing platform from data loss prevention systems and or from unstructured data governance systems e.g. SYMANTEC DATA INSIGHT . The policy broker may also use enterprise role information that describes which application administrators have access to data belonging to what data classifications. The policy broker may allow security administrators to define rules regarding which application administrators may launch cloud computing instances with which IAM roles to access which classes of data.
