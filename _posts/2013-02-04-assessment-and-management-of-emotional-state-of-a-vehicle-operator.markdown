title: Assessment and management of emotional state of a vehicle operator
abstract: Devices, systems, and techniques are provided for assessment and management of an emotional state of a vehicle operator. Assessment of the emotional state of the vehicle can include accessing operational information indicative of performance of a vehicle, behavioral information indicative of behavior of an operator of the vehicle, and or wellness information indicative of a physical condition of the operator of the vehicle. In one aspect, these three types of information can be combined to generate a rich group set of data, metadata, and/or signaling that can be utilized or otherwise leveraged to generate a condition metric representative of the emotional state of the vehicle operator. Management of the emotional state can be customized to the specific context of the vehicle and/or the emotional state, and can be implemented proactively or reactively.

High stress can lead to incidents of various severities when operating a vehicle. One example is road rage in which a driver of a vehicle typically a car a motorcycle or a truck becomes a road safety hazard because of operating the vehicle under a high stress condition. Various factors such as increasing number of vehicles on the road limited road capacity and stress sources associated with modern life tend to exacerbate high stress conditions that can lead to road rage and or other stress induced incidents. Conventional approaches to road safety largely fail to prevent let alone mitigate these types of incidents.

The disclosure recognizes and addresses in one aspect the issue of vehicle operator safety under stress conditions. The disclosure can assess the emotional state also referred to as emotional condition of an occupant of a vehicle and can convey and or manage such state in order to at least improve vehicle operator safety. As described in greater detail below the disclosure provides devices systems and techniques for assessment and management of an emotional state of a vehicle operator. A vehicle can refer to a machine with autonomous mobility having an enclosure e.g. a cabin that accommodates at least one operator. Such mobility can be provided by a combustion engine a battery operated engine a combination thereof or the like. The vehicle can include in certain embodiments one or more passengers. In the present disclosure an operator or a passenger of a vehicle is referred to as an occupant of the vehicle. Assessment of the emotional state of the vehicle can include accessing operational information indicative of performance of a vehicle behavioral information indicative of behavior of an operator of the vehicle and or wellness information indicative of a physical condition of the operator the vehicle. In one aspect these three types of information can be combined or otherwise integrated to generate a rich group of data metadata and or signaling that can be utilized or otherwise leveraged to generate a condition metric representative of the emotional state of the vehicle operator. The emotional state can be conveyed to other vehicle operators by supplying the condition metric. In one scenario the condition metric can be supplied by rendering it to the operator of the vehicle wherein the rendering can include conveying a representation of the condition metric in accordance with visual indicia aural indicia and or a haptic stimulus or a combination thereof. In addition or in the alternative the condition metric can be supplied to various non vehicular structures such as network nodes roadside billboards or the like which can permit generation of a collective emotional state of a group of vehicle operators and management of such state.

Management of the emotional state can be customized to such state and or a specific context of the vehicle that is operated by a driver in the emotional state and can be implemented proactively or reactively. In certain scenarios such management can include configuration of the ambient of the vehicle cabin and or operation of the vehicle. In other scenarios management of the emotional state can include generating information of a route suitable for mitigation of high stress conditions.

At least one example advantage of the disclosure over conventional technology for safety of vehicle operators e.g. drivers may be proactive mitigation of road incidents associated with stressed vehicle operators via communication and or customized management of the emotional state of a vehicle operator. For example by conveying the emotional state of the vehicle operator to other vehicle operators awareness of such emotional state can be created on the other vehicle operators such awareness can be referred to as inter vehicle awareness with the likely ensuing action from these operators directed to reduce the safety hazard posed by a highly stressed vehicle operator associated with the communicated emotional state.

In connection with customized management of an emotional state of a vehicle operator feedback of the emotional state to the vehicle operator itself can permit creating intra vehicle awareness of such state with likely ensuing action to adjust behavior in order to mitigate for example a stress condition or for another example to constrain an excitement condition that may lead to distraction and associated safety risk. At least another advantage of customized management of an emotional state is that specific ambient conditions within the vehicle cabin e.g. temperature condition s lighting condition s seat configuration s a combination thereof or the like can be created in response to a specific emotional state of a vehicle operator. For example an ambient condition can be created via configuration of certain vehicle components. In addition as yet another example advantage in scenarios in which the emotional state is indicative of a high stress condition that poses a safety hazard to the vehicle operator and or passenger s of the vehicle occupant s of other vehicle s and or property the customized management of such high stress condition can include automated regulation of the vehicle operation in order to achieve a safe operation condition.

As illustrated the operational environment includes a vehicle that includes a group of sensors and an emotional state ES assessment platform . It should be appreciated that while eleven sensors are depicted the disclosure is not so limited and contemplates substantially any number of sensors. The group of sensors can be deployed e.g. installed configured accepted installed and accepted configured and accepted installed configured and accepted or the like within the cabin of the vehicle such as components or outside the cabin including one or more sensors e.g. sensors and coupled to the engine of the vehicle or other functional elements such as the brakes or a system functionally coupled thereof such as the anti lock brake system or the engine control unit ECU . At least a portion of the group of sensors can collect or can be configured to collect information e.g. data metadata and or signaling indicative of operational features of the vehicle . For example at least one sensor e.g. one sensor two sensors more than two sensors or the like of the group of sensors can detect or can be configured to detect motion of the vehicle. In such example the group of sensors can include an accelerometer and or a gyroscope. The accelerometer can detect or otherwise collect and or supply information indicative of changes in velocity of the vehicle such as increments in velocity or decrements in velocity also referred to as braking or slowing of the vehicle . It should be appreciated that large magnitude of acceleration can indicate sudden speeding or braking of the vehicle . In addition the gyroscope can detect or otherwise collect and or supply information indicative of steering the vehicle .

At least another portion of the group of sensors can collect or can be configured to collect information indicative of behavior of an occupant of the vehicle such as the operator of the vehicle or a passenger of the vehicle.

In addition or in the alternative the behavioral information can comprise audio information indicative of a speech segment uttered by the operator of the vehicle. A microphone that is available e.g. installed and properly functional within the cabin of the vehicle e.g. sensor can probe or collect the audio information.

Yet another portion of the group of sensors can collect or can be configured to collect information indicative or otherwise representative of physical condition of an occupant e.g. an operator of the vehicle . Such physical condition can include vitals for the occupant of the vehicle such as blood pressure blood sugar concentration heartbeat rate a combination of the foregoing or the like. Accordingly in certain embodiments the group of sensors can include in cabin sensors such as medical devices for probing blood pressure blood sugar concentration toxin concentration e.g. alcohol level heartbeat rate and or pupil dilation. At least some of these in cabin sensors can be installed for example in the steering wheel of the vehicle . Information indicative of a physical condition of an occupant of the vehicle can be referred to as wellness information.

It should be appreciated that information indicative of operation of the vehicle and or behavior of an occupant of the vehicle represents a context of the vehicle .

The group of sensors can be functionally coupled e.g. communicatively coupled to the emotional state ES assessment platform . Such functional coupling can permit the exchange of information e.g. data metadata and or signaling between at least one sensor of the group of sensors and the ES assessment platform . The information can be exchanged in digital format and or analogic format. Accordingly in one aspect the ES assessment platform can access information indicative of operational features of the vehicle referred to as operational information and or information indicative of behavior of an occupant of the vehicle . In addition or in the alternative the ES assessment platform can access information associated with a physical condition of an occupant of the vehicle . In one embodiment such as example embodiment illustrated in a group of one or more sensors can be functionally coupled to the ES assessment platform via link s . The one or more links can comprise wireless link s wireline link s or any combination thereof and in certain implementations can comprise or can be embodied in a vehicle bus such as a controller area network CAN bus CANbus . The sensor s include at least one sensor having the sensing functionality described herein in connection with the sensors . For instance the at least one sensor can generate or otherwise acquire behavioral information operational information and or wellness information. In addition in certain implementations the sensor s can include at least a portion of the sensors .

Operational information and or behavioral information that is accessed by the ES assessment platform can be analyzed or otherwise processed in order to refine existing information or to generate additional operational information and or behavioral information. Thus in one aspect the ES assessment platform can access a wealth of rich information indicative or otherwise representative of operation of the vehicle or behavior of its occupants. In one embodiment e.g. embodiment the ES assessment platform can include a communication platform that can exchange information with at least a portion of the sensor s via the link s and can persist e.g. retain and make available at least a portion of the information in an ES assessment storage within a repository . In addition as illustrated in embodiment shown in the communication platform can include an exchange component that can receive and transmit information from and to a sensor of the sensor s via the link s .

The ES assessment platform can analyze or otherwise process imaging information that is received from a camera e.g. a sensor of the group of sensors or a sensor from the sensor s to extract specific features from such information. In certain embodiments such as embodiment the ES assessment platform can include a component such as ES evaluation component that can analyze or otherwise process the imaging information. As an illustration the analysis or processing can permit extraction or otherwise determination of one or more facial features of the operator of the vehicle . To determine the facial feature in one aspect the ES assessment platform can implement at least a facial recognition technique. In addition or in the alternative it should be appreciated that the ES assessment platform can implement other feature extraction technique s in order to determine facial features of the operator of the vehicle . In embodiment for example the ES evaluation component can implement one or more feature extraction techniques.

Moreover or as another alternative the ES assessment platform can generate gesture information indicative of movement of the operator e.g. operator s hand s movement and or head movement of the vehicle . In embodiment for example the ES evaluation component can generate the gesture information. At least a portion of the gesture information that is generated can be indicative or otherwise representative of the emotional state of the operator of the vehicle or any other vehicle that contains the ES assessment platform . The ES assessment platform can analyze or otherwise process imaging information obtained by the foregoing camera or other camera contained in the group of sensors or sensor s and or by a gesture sensitive device such as a touch screen or touch surface. The gesture sensitive device can be included in the sensor s for example. In response to the analysis or processing the ES assessment platform can determine a gesture of the operator of the vehicle based at least in part on the gesture information. The gesture can be indicative or otherwise representative of the emotional state of the driver. In embodiment for example the ES evaluation component can determine e.g. compute gestures of an operator of a vehicle that contains the ES assessment platform as described herein.

In yet another aspect the ES assessment platform can analyze or otherwise process audio information received from a microphone e.g. a sensor of the group of sensors or a sensor of the sensor s in order to generate and thus access behavioral information. As part of the analysis and or processing the ES assessment platform can determine a verbal feature of the segment speech based at least in part on the audio information. The verbal feature can be representative of the emotional state of the operator and can include or be embodied in specific words or phrases such as he cut me off Other verbal features such as speech portions having certain volume or being delivered in certain manners indicative of stress also can be determined via the analysis and or processing. In embodiment for example the ES evaluation component can determine e.g. compute such verbal features of an operator of a vehicle that includes the ES assessment platform as described herein.

In order to generate or otherwise extract facial features verbal features gestures combinations thereof or the like for example as illustrated in embodiment shown in the ES evaluation component can include an analysis component that can implement various feature extraction techniques such as computerized vision image processing and or speech recognition techniques. In certain implementations such as embodiment illustrated in the analysis component can include a component such as a feature extraction component that can implement various data mining techniques and related feature extraction techniques that can permit generation of facial features verbal features and or gestures of an operator of a vehicle e.g. vehicle that includes the ES assessment platform in accordance with one or more aspects described herein. Information such as data structures metadata objects and or algorithms associated with the feature extraction techniques can be retained in the ES assessment storage .

The ES assessment platform can determine an emotional state or emotional condition of an occupant of the vehicle based at least on operational information behavioral information and or wellness information. In certain embodiments such as embodiment the ES assessment platform can include a component such as the ES evaluation component that can determine e.g. compute or otherwise establish the emotional state of the occupant of the vehicle based at least on operational information behavioral information and or wellness information. In certain embodiments the ES assessment platform can utilize or otherwise leverage artificial intelligence AI to infer the emotional state and thus determine it. The emotional state that is so determined can be classified in to a category within a predetermined classification of emotional conditions e.g. happiness state excitement state stress state high stress state or the like . Artificial intelligence can be implemented via various techniques that permit identification of a specific context or action or generation of a probability distribution of specific states of a system without human intervention. In certain implementation the AI can comprise advanced mathematical algorithms e.g. decision trees neural networks regression analysis cluster analysis genetic algorithm and reinforced learning that can be applied to specific information associated with an operation environment such as a system or a platform. In connection with inferring an emotional state of an occupant of a vehicle in accordance with aspects of the disclosure the ES assessment platform or the ES evaluation component for example can utilize at least one of numerous methodologies for learning from information e.g. data and or metadata and then generating inferences from the models so constructed e.g. Hidden Markov Models HMMs and related prototypical dependency models more general probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks created by structure search using a Bayesian model score or approximation linear classifiers such as support vector machines SVMs non linear classifiers such as methods referred to as neural network methodologies fuzzy logic methodologies and the like.

Determination of the emotional state via inference can include a training or learning process that can be implemented prior to deployment e.g. installation and acceptance of the ES assessment platform and or during utilization of the ES assessment platform . For example at least a portion of operational information behavioral information and or wellness information can be processed via an initial training procedure based on correlation pattern matching machine learning and or other algorithm s . Such a training process can include a confirmation phase or stage in which confirmation of an initial assessment can be effected. The confirmation phase can permit adaptation or refinement of the training process. The training process and the AI techniques can be retained in a repository that is integrated into or functionally coupled to the ES assessment platform or a component thereof. As illustrated in embodiment the training process and such techniques can be retained in the ES assessment storage in repository .

As an illustration of the training process in certain embodiments a user interface at the vehicle or any other vehicle having the ES assessment platform can prompt an occupant of the vehicle to confirm a certain emotional state e.g. anger or happiness and in response the ES assessment platform can collect information that validates or rejects an initial assessment of such emotional state. In one embodiment the user interface can utilize or otherwise leverage text to speech or speech recognition as follows The vehicle can inquire as follows Occupant are you angry now To which the occupant e.g. the driver of the vehicle can respond Yes or No via a touch screen interface a microphone or the like. Such responses can permit validation or rejection of the initially assessed state of anger.

In certain implementations the ES assessment platform can generate a condition metric representative or otherwise indicative of an emotional state of the operator based at least in part on one or more of at least a portion of the operational information at least a portion of the behavioral information and at least a portion of the wellness information. To at least such end in embodiment for example the analysis component can supply one or more behavioral features of at least the portion of the behavioral information and or one or more wellness features of at least the portion of the wellness information. In addition the analysis component can integrate or fuse some or all of the available features either behavioral feature s or wellness feature s or both with at least the portion of the operational information to form contextual information indicative or otherwise representative of the context of the vehicle . Such information is herein referred to as vehicular context information. To integrate such features the analysis component can aggregate or apply one or more operations to at least one of the available features. In certain embodiments e.g. embodiment shown in the analysis component can include an information info. conditioning component that can implement such integration which also can be herein referred to as information fusion. In addition in certain implementations the ES assessment platform can infer an emotional state from at least a portion of the contextual information and can categorize the emotional state according to a predetermined classification as described herein. A category representative of the emotional state can be assigned a metric e.g. a quantitative metric a semi quantitative metric or a qualitative metric which can embody or contain the condition metric.

The vehicular context information can be rich in details associated with performance of the vehicle and a relationship between such a performance and a condition of the operator thereof. It should be appreciated that in one aspect such relationship can associate the condition of the operator with an ensuing response of the vehicle as represented by the performance thereof. Accordingly for example the effect s of the condition of the operator on road safety can be contemplated based at least on performance of the vehicle. At least a portion of the contextual information can be retained in suitable storage e.g. the ES assessment storage . The analysis component can supply at least a portion of the contextual information to a metric generation component or metric generator that based at least on the portion of the contextual information can generate the condition metric indicative or otherwise representative of the emotional state of the operator of the vehicle . The condition metric can be qualitative semi quantitative or quantitative and can be retained in suitable storage e.g. the ES assessment storage .

Availability of the wellness information also referred to as biometric information can be utilized or otherwise leveraged to refine and or validate a specific emotional state of the occupant of the vehicle that may be determined in accordance with at least the operational information and or the behavioral information. As an illustration for an operator of the vehicle the ES assessment platform can correlate certain speech features such as loud utterances with certain physical condition s such as elevated blood pressure and or dilated pupil s in order to validate a previously determined emotional state.

The ES assessment platform can convey the emotional state to an occupant of the vehicle to another vehicle or an occupant therein and or to a specific structure such as a base station a billboard a toll booth or the like within an environment of the vehicle . For example the ES assessment platform can convey an emotional state indication e.g. a data object or other information structure indicative of otherwise representative of the emotional state to at least one of the rendering unit s . A visual aural or haptic representation of such indication can be consumed by an end user or an end user device not depicted functionally coupled to the ES assessment platform . For another example the ES assessment platform can convey an emotional state indication e.g. a data object or other information structure indicative of otherwise representative of the emotional state to a vehicle and or a structure . The vehicle and structure can be external to the vehicle as illustrated by a dot dashed line . At least to convey such a state the ES assessment platform can supply a condition metric indicative or otherwise representative of the emotional state wherein the condition metric can be generated e.g. computed or otherwise determined or received by the ES assessment platform . In one aspect such a metric can embody or can comprise at least one of the ES indication or . In one aspect the ES assessment platform can direct e.g. transmit an instruction to one or more rendering units to render at least one of a visual representation of the condition metric an aural representation of the condition metric or a haptic representation of the condition metric. It certain scenarios the specific representation that is rendered can be specific to the specific condition e.g. excited stressed highly stressed etc. that is represented by the emotional state. For instance a visual representation can be utilized for a stress condition whereas a haptic representation or aural representation can be utilized for a high stress condition. Such selection may ensure that an occupant e.g. an operator or a passenger of the vehicle is more likely aware of the emotional state. The rendering units e.g. rendering unit s can be attached to or integrated into a specific portion of the vehicle where at least a portion of a rendering unit can be situated in the exterior of the vehicle such as display unit and or display unit or the interior thereof. For instance one or more rendering units can be integrated into the dashboard or the seat of a vehicle and can permit rendering visual aural and or haptic representation s of a condition metric to an operator associated therewith in order to provide bio feedback to the operator. Availability of the bio feedback can raise awareness of the emotional state in the operator and thus can permit the operator to control or otherwise adjust the emotional state and or a physical state of the operator. As illustrated in embodiment in the rendering units can be embodied in or can comprise one or more rendering units that can be functionally coupled to the communication platform via link s . Similarly to link s the one or more links can comprise wireless link s wireline link s or any combination thereof and in certain implementations can comprise or can be embodied in a vehicle bus such as a CANbus. In certain implementations wireless communication between a rendering unit of the rendering unit s can be accomplished via at least the radio unit and wireline or tethered communication between another rendering unit of the rendering unit s can be accomplished via at least the exchange component .

In certain implementations the ES assessment platform can convey the emotional state on nearly realtime in response to determination of the emotional state. In other implementations the ES assessment platform can convey the emotional state at specific instants. For instance the emotional state of an operator of the vehicle can be conveyed e.g. updated periodically or according to a schedule. In yet other implementations the ES assessment platform can convey the emotional state conditionally or in response to a specific event such as in response to a request of an occupant or a third party availability of sufficient computational resources bandwidth processing power or the like at the vehicle for communication of such state or specific state represented or indicated by the emotional state. For example in a scenario in which the emotional condition of an operator of a vehicle is deemed to satisfy a specific criterion e.g. a hazard criterion a criterion that defines a level of excitement of the operator or the like the ES assessment platform can convey the emotional state. It should be appreciated that as described herein the emotional state can account for the mental state of an occupant of the vehicle and the performance of the vehicle.

In addition as illustrated in embodiment the ES evaluation component can include a feedback component that can configure or otherwise control a feedback rendering component that can be integrated into a portion of the interior of the vehicle for which an emotional state is assessed. The feedback component can be functionally coupled to the communication platform via one or more links which can be embodied in or can comprise wireline link s wireless link s a combination thereof or the like and in certain implementations can comprise or can be embodied in a vehicle bus such as a CANbus. In certain embodiments the feedback component can direct the feedback rendering component to prompt an occupant of a vehicle that includes the ES assessment platform to implement a specific action. To at least such end for example the feedback component can generate signaling that instructs the feedback rendering component to render information that requests or otherwise prompts an operator or other occupant of the vehicle to effect the specific action. The feedback component can configure or otherwise control the feedback rendering component as described herein in response to a specific state represented or otherwise indicated by an emotional state determined by the ES evaluation component . For example the feedback component can direct the feedback rendering component to convey specific information in response to the emotional state satisfying certain feedback criterion. Feedback criteria can be retained in feedback storage or any repository integrated into or coupled to the feedback component . As described herein for example the feedback rendering component can be integrated into a seat of an occupant of the vehicle in order to provide a haptic stimulus or other type of stimulus e.g. an amount of heat indicative or otherwise representative of such state. As illustrated the feedback rendering component can be a dedicated component distinct from a rendering unit of the group of rendering unit s and can exchange information e.g. data metadata and or signaling with the communication platform . Such exchange can occur in response to communication of a configuration instruction or a directive from the feedback component .

In certain scenarios the ES assessment platform can direct a rendering unit e.g. one of rendering unit s to provide indicia indicative or otherwise representative of the condition metric. For instance a condition metric can be categorized according to a classification of emotional states and in response assigned a specific color representative of the condition metric and associated emotional state. The classification can include a plurality of categories of emotional states such as highly stressed stressed non stressed and each of the plurality of categories can have a respective color such as red representing a highly stressed state yellow representing a stressed state and green representing a non stressed state . In such illustrations a highly stressed state can comprise certain level of anger. Accordingly for example in such state the operator of the vehicle can be deemed to be angry. In addition a stressed state can comprise certain level of confusion. Thus for example an operator of the vehicle who is determined to be in such state can be deemed to be confused. Moreover a non stressed state can comprise certain level of happiness. Accordingly for example an operator in such state can be deemed to be happy. It should be appreciated that indicia other than colors can be utilized to represent a condition metric indicative or otherwise representative of an emotional state. For instance a numeric scale can be contemplated. In various embodiments a plurality of thresholds e.g. numeric or otherwise can define the boundaries for the various categories present in a classification. Thus in one aspect a condition metric that exceeds a threshold can indicate that the occupant of the vehicle associated with the emotional state represented or otherwise indicated by the condition metric has transitioned into a different emotional state. Such transition can be for example a transition to an emotional state representative of higher stress or lower stress. In one aspect the higher the threshold that is exceeded the higher the risk is that the occupant of the vehicle poses a road safety hazard.

The ES assessment platform can utilize or otherwise leverage wireless communication to convey an emotional state of an operator of a vehicle e.g. vehicle to other vehicles or to various structures and or to receive information indicative of an emotional state of one or more respective vehicles. As illustrated in example operational environment the ES assessment platform can communicate wirelessly with a vehicle and or a structure via wireless link s and link s respectively. Each of the wireless link s and can comprise wireless links formed according to a point to point or a line of sight radio technology such as near field communication NFC or Bluetooth. In addition or in the alternative the ES assessment platform can communicate with the vehicle and or the structure through a wireless network . Wireless link s can permit functional coupling e.g. communicative coupling between the ES assessment platform and the network and or component s thereof. As illustrated the vehicle can communicate with one or more of the network s via link s which can be embodied in wireline link s wireless link s a combination thereof or the like.

Wireless communication between the ES assessment platform and the network can be implemented e.g. processed in accordance with various radio technology protocols e.g. 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE Wi Fi Worldwide Interoperabitity for Microwave Access WiMAX or the like . In view of such wireless communication in one aspect the ES assessment platform can transmit a condition metric indicative or otherwise representative of the emotional state to the vehicle and or the structure e.g. infrastructure such as an access point located within a tower or a billboard a toll booth or the like . As illustrated the structure can communicate with one or more of the network s via link s which can be embodied in wireline link s wireless link s a combination thereof or the like.

In certain scenarios for example a vehicle e.g. vehicle can receive wirelessly for example one or more condition metrics from one or more vehicles. At least one condition metric of the one or more condition metrics can be representative of an emotional state of a specific vehicle of the one or more vehicles. At least a portion of the one or more condition metrics that are received can be rendered in various manners at the vehicle. For instance the vehicle can receive a plurality of condition metrics from a plurality of vehicles where each condition metric of the plurality of condition metrics can be representative of an emotional state of a respective vehicle of the plurality of vehicles. The plurality of condition metrics can represent a collective emotional state of a plurality of respective operators of the plurality of vehicles and can be rendered in various manners. For example two or more of those metrics can be rendered at a dashboard or a navigation display panel of the vehicle e.g. vehicle or vehicle . For another example two or more of the plurality of condition metrics can be displayed in conjunction with a visual representation of a traffic condition such as a traffic map associated with a geographic area containing the plurality of vehicles.

In certain embodiments the ES assessment platform can communicate a condition metric indicative or otherwise representative of the emotional state of an operator of a vehicle e.g. vehicle via a link tethered to another vehicle or to infrastructure. The link can be embodied in or can comprise a coaxial cable an optical fiber a twisted pair cable e.g. category 5 Cat5 cable a combination thereof or the like. Such wireline or non wireless communication can utilize or otherwise leverage one or more interfaces for functional coupling e.g. communicative coupling between the vehicle having the ES assessment platform and another vehicle or a device that can receive the condition metric. The one or more interfaces can include a registered jack RJ such as RJ11 RJ14 etc an RS232 connector a universal serial bus USB connector e.g. standard USB connector or micro USB connector a high definition multimedia HDMI connector such as an HDMI1 connector combinations of the foregoing and the like.

It should be appreciated that in one aspect communication or otherwise display of an emotional state of the operator of a vehicle to other vehicles can permit raising awareness of such state in the occupant s of the other vehicles. Raising awareness can permit operators of the other vehicles to respond to or otherwise adapt their operation behavior to the vehicle that conveys the emotional state. As an illustration in a scenario in which a vehicle conveys a stressed state or a highly stressed state nearby drivers may modify their driving behavior by following the vehicle less closely or letting it merge into a lane or street in response to such states. As another illustration in a scenario in which a vehicle conveys an emotional state of anxiety or confusion for example unfamiliarity of the driver of the vehicle with these roads may have created such state nearby drivers may permit such driver to cut in to traffic more readily and or safely. In addition particularly yet not exclusively in scenarios in which the emotional state is a highly stressed state communication of the emotional state can permit apprising authorities and or law enforcement of the emotional condition of the operator of the vehicle. Thus it is readily apparent in one aspect that generation and or communication of contemporaneous emotional state of an operator of a vehicle can permit mitigation or avoidance of stress induced road incidents.

The disclosure permits active management of emotional conditions that may present a road safety hazard. In certain embodiments the ES assessment platform can generate or otherwise acquire a condition metric representative of an emotional state of a vehicle e.g. vehicle or vehicle . The ES assessment platform can analyze the condition metric and can determine if the condition metric satisfies a vehicular safety hazard criterion based at least on an outcome of the analysis. For example in embodiment shown in an analysis component can generate the condition metric and can supply such condition to a hazard response component that can ascertain that the condition satisfies the vehicular hazard criterion. In addition or in the alternative the communication platform can acquire e.g. receive wirelessly the condition metric from an external source such as another vehicle or infrastructure and can supply the condition metric to the hazard response component for analysis thereof. In certain implementations the vehicular safety hazard criterion can be embodied in or can include a frequency of swerving that is above a predetermined threshold an inter vehicle distance below recommended safety guidelines e.g. 10 meters per 10 Km h in vehicle speed that is sustained for a predetermined period elevated frequency e.g. frequency above a threshold of switching between periods of acceleration and deceleration speed significantly above the speed limit a combination thereof or the like. One or more vehicular safety hazard criteria can be retained in hazard assessment storage within the repository or any other repository or memory device functionally coupled to the ES assessment component .

In a scenario in which the ES assessment platform ascertains via for example the hazard response component that a safety hazard criterion is satisfied the ES assessment platform can configure a vehicle component to operate within certain bounds or specifications that can permit the adjustment of the emotional state of the operator. To at least such end in one aspect a component that ascertains fulfillment of the hazard criterion for example the hazard response component can transmit configuration instruction s to the vehicle component. The configuration instruction s can be transmitted in a format suitable for communication with the vehicle component. The format can be dictated by a packet switched protocol for communication or a circuit switched protocol for communication. The vehicle component can be included in a group of vehicle components that can be configured to attain certain performance and or operational condition of the vehicle. For instance in embodiment the group of vehicle components can include the rendering unit s the control component s and the lighting component s . As illustrated at least one of the control component s can be functionally coupled to the communication platform via one or more links and at least one of the lighting component s can be functionally coupled to the communication platform via one or more links .

In certain embodiments the vehicle component can include a content rendering unit such as a display unit or a display terminal a loudspeaker or the like which can be included in the rendering unit s an in cabin ambient control unit e.g. a lighting fixture a temperature control unit a seat firmness unit or the like or an operation control unit e.g. a throttle or an engine control unit functionally coupled thereto . The in cabin ambient control unit can be included in one of the control component s or the lighting component s . In certain implementations for example the ES assessment platform can configure a sound system to render music e.g. to playback a recording or reproduce stream content from a radio station or to playback recorded messages in order to modify the behavior of the operator of the vehicle in response to ascertaining that the safety hazard criterion is satisfied. Similarly the ES assessment platform can configure an air conditioning component to lower the temperature of the vehicle s cabin and thus adjust the emotional state of the operator. For another example the ES assessment platform can actuate an artificial intelligence AI component configured to recognize speech and in response to provide autonomous aural responses and can configure the sound system or a portion thereof to collect ambient sounds and deliver responses from the AI component.

In addition in the present specification and annexed drawings terms such as store storage data store data storage memory repository and substantially any other information storage component relevant to operation and functionality of a component of the disclosure refer to memory components functional entities embodied in or comprising a memory device or storage device or components forming the memory device or storage device. It can be appreciated that the memory components or memories described herein embody or comprise non transitory computer storage media that can be readable or otherwise accessible by a computing device. Such media can be implemented in any methods or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions information structures program modules or other information objects. The memory components or memories can be either volatile memory or non volatile memory or can include both volatile and non volatile memory. In addition the memory components or memories can be removable or non removable and or internal or external to a computing device or component. Example of various types of non transitory storage media can comprise hard disc drives zip drives CD ROM digital versatile disks DVD or other optical storage magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices flash memory cards or other types of memory cards cartridges or any other non transitory medium suitable to retain the desired information and which can be accessed by a computing device.

As an illustration non volatile memory can include read only memory ROM programmable ROM PROM electrically programmable ROM EPROM electrically erasable ROM EEPROM or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory RAM which acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation RAM is available in many forms such as synchronous RAM SRAM dynamic RAM DRAM synchronous DRAM SDRAM double data rate SDRAM DDR SDRAM enhanced SDRAM ESDRAM Synchlink DRAM SLDRAM and direct Rambus RAM DRRAM . The disclosed memory components or memories of operational environments described herein are intended to comprise one or more of these and or any other suitable types of memory.

Conditional language such as among others can could might or may unless specifically stated otherwise or otherwise understood within the context as used is generally intended to convey that certain implementations could include while other implementations do not include certain features elements and or operations. Thus such conditional language generally is not intended to imply that features elements and or operations are in any way required for one or more implementations or that one or more implementations necessarily include logic for deciding with or without user input or prompting whether these features elements and or operations are included or are to be performed in any particular implementation.

What has been described herein in the present specification and annexed drawings includes examples of systems devices and techniques that can provide assessment and management of an emotional condition of an operator of a vehicle. It is of course not possible to describe every conceivable combination of elements and or methods for purposes of describing the various features of the disclosure but it can be recognized that many further combinations and permutations of the disclosed features are possible. Accordingly it may be apparent that various modifications can be made to the disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit thereof. In addition or in the alternative other embodiments of the disclosure may be apparent from consideration of the specification and annexed drawings and practice of the disclosure as presented herein. It is intended that the examples put forward in the specification and annexed drawings be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.
