Serial femtosecond fs 10seconds crystallography SFX using X ray Free Electron laser XFEL radiation is an emerging method for three dimensional 3D structure determination that extracts structural information from nanometer nm 10meters to micron micrometer m 10meters sized crystals. This method relies upon intense X ray pulses that are sufficiently short to pass through the sample before the onset of significant radiation damage diffraction before destruction . SFX therefore promises to break the correlation between sample size damage and resolution in structural biology. In this approach a liquid microjet is used to introduce randomly oriented crystals into the XFEL beam. Structures with less than 2 ngstr m 1 10meters resolution have been solved using the method. SFX is unique from standard crystallography in that particle sizes on the order of microns dispersed in aqueous solutions are used instead of a single large crystal that takes months of method development to grow mounted on a loop or grid. One known method to deliver sample to the x ray interaction region is the Gas Dynamic Virtual Nozzle GDVN e.g. see Shapiro Chapman et al. 2008 DePonte et al. 2008 2009 2011 and Ganon Calvo et al. 2010 . A thin liquid jet is formed from a highly pressurized liquid reservoir and a high pressure sheath gas flow from concentric capillary tubes. The thin jet is subjected to femtosecond X ray pulses e.g. see Barty Caleman et al. 2011 Chapman Fromme et al. 2011 Hunter DePonte et al. 2011 Lomb Barends et al. 2011 Aquila Hunter et al. 2012 Johansson Arnlund et al. 2012 Koopmann Cupelli et al. 2012 .

Though suitable for many purposes the known method for sample delivery suffers from one or more of the following disadvantages determined by inventors 1 high sample consumption rate compared to precious sample amounts 2 sample settling in the reservoir or transfer lines prior to analysis 3 fluctuation of jet position and 4 use of gas sheath and metal shield surrounding the liquid jet in a vacuum chamber. Current sample consumption rates are typically 10 to 16 microliters l 1 l 10liters per minute min . Sample consumption rates of less than about one l min are desirable to enable analysis of precious biological samples. Sample settling reduces data collection rates and increases the likelihood of clogging. Stability of the jet position is desirable because of the small size of the jet 1 micron and the X ray focus 0.1 1 micron . Access to the jet unimpeded by differential pumping shrouds gas sheath flows or other components is highly desirable for performing time resolved crystallography experiments such as measurements at several points along the liquid jet and downstream droplet cloud.

Improvements are disclosed here that allow stable low consumption rate accessible liquid jet with nanoscale and microscale targets such as molecules nanometer sized crystals nanocrystals cells or organelles in vacuum. Such a liquid jet is called herein a nanoflow liquid jet and is suitable for SFX as well as for nanoparticle synthesis soft ionization of biomacromolecules for mass spectrometry thin film generation high harmonic generation and pharmaceutical delivery.

In a first set of embodiments a method includes providing a sample fluid by mixing a plurality of a first target of interest with a carrier fluid. The method includes injecting the sample fluid into a vacuum chamber at a rate less than about 4 microliters per minute.

In another set of embodiments an apparatus includes a pump configured to apply pressure to a sample fluid and a capillary tube of inner diameter less than 100 microns in fluid communication with the pump wherein the capillary tube is open at a distal end. The apparatus also includes a voltage source configured to apply a first voltage to the sample fluid inside the capillary tube and a counter electrode configured to be charged at a different second voltage. The counter electrode has a shape that is axially symmetric and has a first end closest to an axis of symmetry and a second edge farthest from the axis of symmetry. The distal end of the capillary and the counter electrode are configured to be disposed inside a vacuum chamber

In another set of embodiments a non transitory computer readable medium carries one or more sequences of instructions wherein execution of the one or more sequences of instructions by one or more processors causes an apparatus to perform applying a first voltage to a sample fluid and a different second voltage to a counter electrode in a vacuum chamber. The apparatus is further caused to inject the sample fluid into the vacuum chamber at a rate less than about 4 microliters per minute.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

A method and apparatus are described for nanoflow liquid jet and serial femtosecond X ray protein crystallography. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Various references are cited herein both above and in the following. The entire contents of the cited references are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein except for terminology that is inconsistent with the terminology used herein. As used herein the following terms and abbreviations have the meanings given in Table. 1.

Some embodiments of the invention are described below in the context of serial femtosecond X ray crystallography SFX of protein nanocrystals. However the invention is not limited to this context. In other embodiments filtered or unfiltered nanocrystals of other molecules cells viruses organelles such as carboxysomes or single molecules are included in the sample fluid or nanoflow liquid jet is used for one or more other purposes such as nanoparticle synthesis soft ionization of biomacromolecules for mass spectrometry thin film generation high harmonic generation and pharmaceutical delivery. In other embodiments additional detection schemes can be used to probe the interaction of the X ray pulse with the injected sample such as analyzers used for spectroscopy or time of flight mass spectrometry. One or more of such detectors can be used separately or in parallel with the X ray scattering detector. In other embodiments synchrotron radiation or laser pulses from table top lasers systems of any available wavelength are used. For the latter synchronized timing with XFEL pulses can provide the means to make movies of molecular processes perhaps even to femtosecond resolution where the optical pulse pumps the molecules in a crystal and the X rays probe the structure. In other embodiments the molecules of interest are mixed with a reactant a known distance from the interaction region to provide study of chemical kinetics.

In the work presented here solvent properties such as 30 glycerol 10 polyethylene glycol PEG or 10 PEG 1.4 molar M sucrose in water have been discovered for stable electrospinning in vacuo. Furthermore it has been discovered that nanocrystals can be delivered in a one micron diameter jet in vacuo. These discoveries provide a new nanoflow source suitable for serial femtosecond crystallography SFX among other processes. These techniques for electrospinning in vacuo have opened the application of SFX to a much wider array of biological materials because it consumes about 50 times less sample than the current method based on GDVN. Furthermore these techniques provide other advantages such as the reduction of settling the removal of a gas sheath that contaminates the x ray scattering and the removal of a metal shroud that limits the locations along the flow focused liquid jet of GDVN where measurements can be made. In the work presented here measurements can even be made inside the Taylor cone providing typically a 50 micron dependent on capillary inner diameter X ray path length through the sample.

When used for SFX the sample fluid jet is illuminated by an X ray beam from X ray source and the scattered emissions photons are recorded at an X ray detector array . The incident and scattered X rays pass through ports in the metal shroud . A disadvantage of this arrangement is that the position of the sample fluid jet fluctuates so that the ports are not always ideally aligned. Also the presence of the metal shroud makes it difficult to measure the X ray scattering at multiple different distances along the sample fluid jet and the valuable high angle scattering from the sample can be shadowed from the detector array . Furthermore the X ray scattering even through the ports is affected by the presence of the gas sheath flow . In addition target molecules in the low viscosity sample fluid tend to settle out in one or more pumps or reservoirs before reaching the GDVN causing the target molecules to be more sparse in the sample fluid jet and thus reducing the number of useful measurements from the X ray beam .

Electrospray was attempted to circumvent the limitations of GDVN. Unexpectedly it was observed that the synchrotron radiation severely perturbs the electrospray. Powder diffraction from crystal suspensions delivered to synchrotron radiation by GDVN has been recorded Shapiro Chapman et al. 2008 . An attempt to repeat this experiment on crystals passing through the Taylor cone of an electrospray source at atmospheric pressure was performed at the Swiss Light Source cSAXS beamline using a fully closed gap configuration of the U19 undulator 4.6 mm and 8 kilo electron Volts keV 1 keV 10electron Volts X rays focused into n approximately 5 micron 20 micron 100 square micron footprint containing up to 10photons second. through are photographs that illustrate breakdown of electrospray from a 100 micron outer diameter capillary under exposure to X rays at atmospheric pressures before during and after exposure to synchrotron radiation. The result is that only the leading edge of the X rays interacts with the electrospray. The Taylor cone compresses in less than 100 milliseconds ms 1 ms 10seconds and does not return until about 1000 ms after a shutter of the X ray source is closed. Thus no signal can be recorded from the electrospray after a time less than about 40 ms. These measurements show evidence that the destabilization occurs on a timescale shorter than about 10 ms as the use of 10 ms exposures did not result in any detectable signals. It was concluded that rapid gas ionization by the incoming X ray pulse destabilizes the electrospray and precludes the use of synchrotrons to probe the structure and dynamics of electrosprays and the particles within them.

Use of the LCLS X ray laser alleviates this shortcoming by providing ultrabright and ultrashort X ray pulses that pass through the electrospray before it is destabilized by gas ionization. The plasma created by the beam breaks down and recombines on the scale of microseconds enabling probing of an electrospray operating at atmospheric pressure with a repetition rate of 1 Hz. It is suspected that the physical reformation of the Taylor cone is the rate limiting process. However another unexpected problem was that geometrical constraints of the large X ray beam path at CXI caused background scattering from the high concentration of gas molecules. This background scattering precluded recording of crystalline Bragg diffraction.

Thus it was observed that atmospheric pressure electrosprays cannot be probed with synchrotron radiation without severe perturbations. X rays lasers can probe electrosprays at atmospheric pressure with 1 Hz repetition rate limited by the electrospray re stabilization but suffer from background scattering by surrounding gas molecules.

Electrospun liquid jets of protein crystals in vacuo can be made to similar dimensions as liquid jets created using a gas dynamic virtual nozzle and provide a complementary sample delivery mechanism for SFX using X ray lasers. However without cryoprotectant added to carrier fluids the jet breaks down due to freezing and the GDVN must be used with all its limitations.

To reduce background scattering conditions were determined for stable electrospray in vacuo absent a gas sheath. Glycerol was added as a cryoprotectant to overcome the limitation of immediate freezing at the capillary exit. Studies of glycerol electrosprays in vacuo have shown high stability at 

For electrospinning the fluid is charged by a high voltage HV source such as a Stanford Research Systems 0 5 kiloVolt kV 1 kV 10volts or 10 kV power supply connected to a metal union component that transfers the voltage applied to a metal vessel to a conducting fluid such as the sample fluid contained in the vessel. The electrical current in picoamperes pA 1 pA 10Amperes which flows into the fluid to maintain the voltage is measured by an ammeter . A counter electrode is charged to a different voltage e.g. to electrical ground in the illustrated embodiment. An opening in the proximal end of the counter electrode allows the flow of sample fluid to be collected neatly in a sample catcher after passing the counter electrode .

In the illustrated embodiment the counter electrode is shaped as a cone with it apex removed as depicted in and . and are block diagrams that illustrate a conical counter electrode with apex removed in oblique and plan views respectively according to an embodiment. That is the counter electrode has a shape that is axially symmetric and has a first end closest to an axis of symmetry and a second edge farthest from the axis. In some embodiments the counter electrode has a more complex structure with multiple electrodes and multiple voltages. For example a segmented quad electrode depicted in and with four segments through respectively making up the cone each separately chargeable would enable steering functionality. and are block diagrams that illustrate a quad electrode conical counter electrode with apex removed in oblique and plan views respectively according to an embodiment.

The counter electrode or is disposed with the axis aligned with the flow of the sample fluid e.g. the center of the capillary tube and with the first edge closer than the second edge to an injection point at the open distal end of the capillary e.g. silica capillary where the sample fluid is injected toward the counter electrode . The electrospray forms a Taylor cone downstream of the distal end of capillary followed by an electrospray jet and in some embodiments a plume . Tapering the distal open end of the capillary tube offers the advantage of enhancing formation of the Taylor cone .

For electrospinning in vacuo the capillary e.g. silica capillary is passed into a vacuum chamber through a feedthrough fitting such as a 1 16 Swagelok fitting. In some embodiments the capillary tube was fixed to a stepper such as an XYZ nanopositioning stage to enable positioning of the tube distal end and the jet emanating from it relative to other components in the vacuum chamber as indicated by the double arrows in two dimensions. Vacuum pressures of about 10torr are achieved by the vacuum pump . In various embodiments the vacuum pressure is in a range from about 10torr to about 10torr. The vacuum pressure is monitored by pressure gauge . The counter electrode is disposed in the vacuum chamber with the axis aligned with the flow of the sample fluid in the vacuum chamber and with the first edge closer than the second edge to an injection point at the distal end of capillary where the sample fluid is injected into the vacuum chamber.

To visualize the electrospray in some embodiments a light source such as fiber optic lighting source emits a light beam e.g. light beam into the vacuum chamber . In various other embodiments an in vacuum LED or in vacuum pulsed laser acts as the light source. The transmitted light is detected at a video camera such as formed by lenses stereomicroscope and charge coupled device CCD array . In some embodiments the electro spray is not visualized and one or more of components and are omitted.

For SFX applications within vacuum chamber an X ray source such as a XFEL emits an X ray beam such as serial femto second pulse X ray beam that intersects the electrospray such as along electrospray jet . Intersection of the X ray beam is controlled by stepper moving the distal end so that the beam intersects at different portion of the fluid flow either at Taylor cone or jet or plume . Scattered X ray photons are detected at the x ray detector array .

In some embodiments a controller is included to control one or more of syringe pump high voltage source fiber optic lighting source vacuum pump and X ray source . In some embodiments the controller also receives or stores output or both from one or more of flow sensor ammeter pressure gauge and CCD array . In various embodiments the controller comprises one or more computer systems as depicted in or chip sets as depicted in or some combination. depicts a perpendicular view in the direction indicated by the arrow labeled B.

In vacuum chamber stepper feedthrough capillary Taylor cone electrospray jet plume counter electrode and controller are as described above. Apparent in this view are the X ray source and X ray detector array as well as the X ray beam also included in and described above. Here also shown are Bragg scattered X ray photons not previously depicted.

The nanoscale dimensions of electrosprays in particular the jet filament and the submicrometer droplet size distribution have never been measured in situ because typical light scattering techniques cannot be extended to this scale Smith Flagan et al. 2002 Wortmann Kistler Momotova et al. 2007 . However the perturbation of biological materials transiting within these nanoscale electrospray regions has received recent interest because of the growth in applications of electrosprays to the characterization and preparation of biological materials. For example tobacco mosaic virus has been shown to collapse during the electrospray process Allmaier Laschober et al. 2008 and the viability of bacteriophages is known to vary with applied electrospray voltage Jung Lee et al. 2009 . Currently the point during the electrospray process at which these changes in biomaterial structure are induced is not known. Insights into these structural perturbations are important to optimize electrospray delivery of biological materials to surfaces for applications such as biomimetic solar cell manufacture Modesto Lopez Thimsen et al. 2009 injection into vacuum for mass spectrometry Patriksson Marklund et al. 2007 and single molecule x ray diffractive imaging applications Bogan Benner et al. 2008 Bogan Boutet et al. 2009 

SFX provides an opportunity to determine structural changes at various positions along the electrospray by measuring X ray diffraction from materials inside of electrosprays. Due to the anatomy of an electrospray signal changes are expected to be measured based on the position along the electrospray where the X rays probe and any structural changes induced in the target biomolecule.

Strong signals are expected from materials inside of the electrospray capillary at position just outside the needle tip in an experiment identical to Small angle X ray scattering SAXS measurements on liquids flowing through capillaries. In this position the sample volume 2 10cm is defined by the capillary diameter 50 m and the beam size 20 m . For a solution of proteins with 10particles per ml this corresponds to 20 000 proteins in the exposure volume at any one instant. In position of the jet materials are concentrated in space into a small filament of liquid 

Thus there is interest in all three electrospray regions including the Taylor cone in the immediate vicinity of the nozzle tip the thin electrostatic jet emerging from the tip of the Taylor cone and the plume of fine droplets formed by Coulombic explosion in the jet. The conformation of several classes of biological particles ranging from single proteins to larger macromolecular aggregates or crystals can be characterized by x ray scattering in an attempt to monitor conformational changes that occur during electrospray process. Analysis of the scattered intensity allows the study of particle dynamics in electrospray such as hydrodynamic alignment and structural modification of biological molecules caused by interaction with strong electric field water shell evaporation and potentially even biological ion evaporation from the nanoscale droplets a phenomenon predicted to occur on a picosecond ps 1 ps 10seconds timescale see e.g. Marginean Znamenskiy et al. 2006 . The thin jet region is of particular interest for SFX since the jet can be used for nanocrystal delivery.

In step a sample fluid is prepared by mixing multiple copies of a target of interest such as a molecule crystal cell or organelle of interest with a carrier fluid. Thus step provides a sample fluid by mixing a plurality of a first target of interest with a carrier fluid. In some embodiments about 10copies of a target molecule are included per milliliter of sample fluid. In some embodiments step includes step in which nanoscale crystals are mixed with a viscous electrically conductive carrier fluid with conductivity similar to fluids used in well known electrospray operation. Experimental embodiments included conductivities in a range of from about 0.5 to about 5 milliSiemens per centimeter mS cm 1 milliSiemen mS 10Siemens 1 centimeter cm 10meters . It was determined that below a value of approximately 0.5 mS cm the form of the electrospray starts suffering which requires higher and higher voltages which leads to the jet beginimg to suffer and fail. In some of these embodiments about 10nanocrystals of the target molecule are included per milliliter of sample fluid. Thus in some embodiments providing the sample fluid further comprises providing the sample fluid by mixing a plurality of nanoscale crystals of the first target of interest with the carrier fluid. In some embodiments the nanoscale crystals are each smaller than about 500 nanometers in a largest dimension. In various embodiments crystals of sizes from 0.2 microns to 20 micron have been measured at LCLS. In some embodiments the viscosity of the carrier fluid is in a range from about 3 centipoise cP to about 5 cP. For example in some embodiments the carrier fluid comprises 30 by volume glycerol and 10 by volume polyethylene glycol PEG 2000.

In step the sample fluid is injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate less than about 4 microliters per minute a rate that is a lower than is achievable with GDVN. In some embodiments the injection rate is preferably even lower at less than 1 microliters per minute. In some embodiments the injection rate is about 0.1 to 0.5 microliters per minute. At about 0.3 microliters per minute the target molecules or nanocrystals passes an x ray focus at a rate of about 5000 per second.

In an illustrated embodiment such nanoflow is achieved by steps and . In step a first voltage is applied to the sample fluid e.g. at a fluid electrode such as metal union or an electrode in contact with the sample reservoir and a different second voltage is applied to the counter electrode . In various embodiments 1.7 kilovolts kV 1 kV 10volts to 5 kV are applied to one electrode and 0 to 5 kV applied to the other. For example some embodiments operate with 2.3 kV in solution and 0.3 kV on the counter electrode and 6 millimeters mm 1 mm 10meters to 8 mm distance between capillary and the counter electrode. In other embodiments voltages are inverted to operate in negative mode electrospinning.

In step the vacuum chamber is evacuated to a pressure less than about 10Torr. Stable jetting is not observed at intermediate pressures above this level and below atmospheric pressure consistent with prior work on pure glycerol and solat doped glycerol solutions e.g. see Ku B. K. Kim 2003 . In step pressure is applied to the sample fluid connected to the vacuum chamber by the single capillary tube e.g. pressure is applied by syringe pump in fluid communication with silica capillary .

In various embodiments the capillary tube has an inner diameter ID less than or equal to about 150 m. For example the fluid is injected through a single silicon capillary tube of ID about 50 microns to 150 microns ID with both tapered and non tapered distal end exits. Smaller capillaries are available commercially down to 5 micron inner diameter. Smaller capillaries lead to decreased flow rate and sample consumption but this is offset by increased likelihood for clogging. Capillaries smaller than 50 micron ID are most successful with pre filtered solutions of less than 2 micron crystals preferably less than 500 nm crystals In some embodiment the sample fluid in the vacuum forms a jet less than about one micron in diameter.

In various embodiments the vacuum chamber does not include a shroud to separate the vacuum chamber into two or more volumes pumped to different vacuum pressures as in a GDVN. In various embodiments applied pressure injects the sample fluid into the vacuum chamber through a single silicon capillary tube without a sheath fluid flow introduced through a second concentric capillary tube as in a GDVN.

In step the focus of the X ray source is positioned in the electrospray for example using nanoscale stepping motors attached to the capillary or feedthrough . In step the sample fluid is exposed to the X ray beam such as femtosecond pulse high energy x ray beams from XFEL source at Linac Coherent Light Source s LCLS Coherent X ray Imaging CXI endstation. Thus step includes exposing a portion of the sample fluid in the vacuum chamber to a femtosecond pulse high energy X ray beam. For example measurements are made at 120 femtosecond pulses per second. In step the X ray scattering is measured from each target molecule or a nanocrystal of multiple copies of the target molecule e.g. at an X ray detector array. Thus step includes measuring at an X ray detector array an X ray scattering pattern for the first target in the sample fluid in the vacuum chamber in response to exposing the portion of the sample fluid to the X ray beam. The structure of the molecule is then deduced based on the measured scattering using any method known in the art.

For 10crystals per milliliter and a nanoflow rate of 0.3 microliters per minute 5000 crystals pass the focus every second or 250 per sample period providing enough targets to reliably interact with one femtosecond pulse during the sample period. For example about ten to fifteen thousand samples of X ray scattering are obtained per milliliter of sample. This is sufficient to provide statistically significant deduction of target molecule structure from randomly oriented target molecules or crystals thereof. Due to the statistical nature of this random sampling it is advantageous to have minimum sample flow required to replenish the sample between each X ray pulse in order to preserve rare samples.

Tables 2A through 2E indicate X ray source operation in various embodiments compared to other SFX operations.

The relative performance of the nanoflow electrospinning and the GDVN are compared in Table 3 for one embodiment.

The electrostatic liquid jet illustrated in is used to perform SFX with 20 times lower sample consumption rate e.g. a flow rate of 500 nanoliters per minute. Experiments with both a 50 micron inner diameter capillary and a 75 micron inner diameter capillary are given in Table 4. This experiment consumed 0.046 ml of sample fluid and produced an average of 3 hits per second. Using GDVN to index three times as many hits consumed 2.6 ml not three times the volume but 56 times the volume consumed by the nanoflow liquid jet in vacuo.

In another embodiment a new counter electrode was designed and built and operated with a centered capillary. Long term 48 hour testing of new design was performed with 30 10 glycerol PEG 2000. Repeated 1.5 ml sample fluid 24 hr tests were performed. New buffer conditions with Sucrose PEG 2000 were explored. and are photographs that illustrate example reduction of sample fluid collection on counter electrodes and according to an embodiment. It is concluded that new counter electrode design runs continuously for days with no sample buildup when capillary centered 75 um ID capillary 1 l min flow rate . This is a huge improvement because previously intervention due to sample fluid collection reaching the x ray interaction region was required at 4 hrs. It was further concluded that though multiple capillaries can be used a single capillary will produce most reproducible jetting conditions sucrose can substitute glycerol and in some embodiments a Kapton heater is attached to the counter electrode to reduce sample fluid collection .

In some experiments injection of the samples into the interaction region was achieved by focusing the crystal suspension exiting a silica capillary 100 m inner diameter into a jet smaller than 10 m in diameter using an electric potential of 2.1 2.5 keV between the capillary exit and a counter electrode 7 mm away. The crystal suspension flowed at 2.5 3.1 l min using a liquid backing pressure of 15 20 psi. Buffer B with 10 PEG 2000 does not electrospray in vacuum due to freezing at the nozzle exit. Glycerol was added as a cryoprotectant to eliminate freezing and enable formation of a stable cone jet mode. Surprisingly the combination of glycerol and PEG 2000 in the buffer also contributed to the low flow rate operation and reduced settling of the crystals during the experiment. The X rays probed the liquid jet 50 100 m from the exit of the capillary exposing the crystal suspension to vacuum for fractions of a second.

In another embodiment the X ray diffraction pattern of PS II isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus was collected at the Coherent X ray Imaging CXI instrument at LCLS using the single shot approach. PS II microcrystals 10 m were injected into the LCLS X ray beam in a liquid jet based on the electrohydrodynamic spraying of glycerol in vacuum using cone jet mode. Several thousand diffraction images were collected at random crystal orientations. A single shot diffraction pattern from a microcrystal exhibits Bragg spots up to 5.4 resolution. The Bragg spots are remarkably sharp and small spreading over only a few pixels. This is likely due to the combination of low crystal mosaicity and the use of pixel array detector technology with an extremely narrow point spread function. The diffraction intensities varied strongly from shot to shot due to several factors such as the size of the probed crystal volume the quality of the microcrystals and orientation and variations in the intensity of the beam due to the nature of the LCLS X ray pulses.

Experiments were carried out at the CXI instrument at LCLS. is a block diagram that illustrates an experimental nanoflow liquid jet for SFX according to an embodiment. This was the experimental setup for a SFX experiment at the LCLS CXI endstation. The endstation includes an interaction point with a 10 square micron focus resulting from KB mirrors focusing X ray synchrotron radiation output by an undulator located 420 meters upstream of the interaction point . The KB mirrors and undulator collectively form an X ray source . The Bragg scattered photons from a target at the interaction point is captured at a CSPAD detector located 93 millimeters mm 1 mm 10meters downstream from the interaction point .

A crystal suspension was prepared of 1 2 micron thermolysin crystals in 30 v v glycerol with 10 polyethylene glycol PEG 2000 CaCl dissolved in deionized water. The crystals were then filtered through an 8 m pore size Nucleopore membrane Whatman . A 100 L aliquot of the sample filtered crystal suspension in a microcentrifuge tube was loaded into the pressurized cell of a TSI electrospray aerosol generator 3980 from TSI Inc. of Shoreview Minn. A solution high voltage HV electrode was immersed in the sample . A 114 cm long 50 m ID capillary delivered the sample crystal suspension to the interaction region inside the vacuum chamber through a 1 16 Swagelok fitting. The capillary was fixed to an XYZ nanopositioning stage PI Micos PP 30 from PI USA of Auburn Mass. to enable positioning relative to the focused X ray beam.

A counter electrode was 1 cm in diameter and positioned 5 to 7 mm from the capillary exit. A sample catcher backed up the counter electrode . The nanoflow liquid jet was visualized using a CXI microscope on axis with the X rays and was facilitated with illumination by a nanosecond pulsed laser 532 nm wavelength .

During operation 2.5 kiloVolts kV 1 kV 10volts was applied to the solution high voltage HV electrode and 0.2 kV was applied to the counter electrode . An nanoflow liquid jet flowing at 0.3 l min at flow sensor was emitted from the 50 micron ID silica capillary positioned less than about 1 mm from the XFEL interaction region surrounding interaction point . Single pulse diffraction patterns from single crystals flowing in the nanoflow liquid jet were recorded on the CSPAD detector at a 120 Hz repetition rate of the LCLS. Each 40 femtosecond pulse delivered an average of 3 milliJoules mJ 1 mJ 10Joules focused at the interaction point using 9.7 keV X rays in beam . Thus depicts nanoflow liquid jet serial femtosecond crystallography at the Coherent X ray Imaging endstation for protein nanocrystals in vacuo.

A crystal suspension was prepared. A solution high voltage HV electrode was immersed in the sample . A 114 cm long 50 m ID capillary delivered the sample crystal suspension to the interaction region inside the vacuum chamber.

During operation 2.5 kV was applied to the solution high voltage HV electrode and 0.2 kV was applied to the counter electrode . An nanoflow liquid jet flowing at 0.17 l min at flow sensor was emitted from the 50 micron ID silica capillary to interaction point . Single pulse diffraction patterns from single crystals flowing in the nanoflow liquid jet were recorded on the CSPAD detector from X rays in beam .

In other experimental embodiments the CXI instrument at LCLS was operated at an energy of 9 keV with an average intensity of 3 5 10photons pulse a pulse frequency of 120 Hz and a pulse duration of 

PS II diffraction data was processed with a new software suite cctbx.xfel from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Berkeley Calif. that builds upon components developed previously in the synchrotron context for picking Bragg spots spotfinder Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Berkeley Calif. and autoindexing labelit Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Berkeley Calif. and employs established methods for the integration of Bragg spot intensities by pixel summation. Individual reflections were scaled and merged without separately accounting for the partiality fraction of each observation. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser from University of Cambridge Cambridge United Kingdom.

In some embodiments the injector is comprised of many off the shelf parts. The capillary is a tapered 1 m long borosilicate glass capillary New Objective Woburn Mass. with inner diameters of 50 m 75 m and 100 m. The reservoir used in Siena Laksmono et al. 2012 was a tapered Eppendorf Hamburg Germany microcentrifuge tube that was placed inside of a pressure cell from a TSI Inc. Shoreview Minn. electrospray box. A more off the shelve reservoir has been developed and used in unpublished work. It involves a Shimadzu Tokyo Japan autosampler vial which acts as the reservoir for the crystal suspension. There is a simpler 300 L polypropylene vial with a PTFE silicone septum. For better visibility of the sample a 200 L Q sert glass autosampler vial is used. Both use plastic caps with a polymer septum which allows the capillary platinum electrode and pressure line to pierce through and interact with the fluid in the reservoir.
