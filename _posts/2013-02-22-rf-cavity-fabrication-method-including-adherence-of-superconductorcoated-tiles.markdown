abstract: As typically embodied, the present invention's RF cavity device comprises a rigid frame and plural flexible tiles. The frame includes walls of at least substantially uniform thicknesses that describe a hollow pillbox shape. The tiles are at least approximately equally thick, each tile being of at least substantially uniform thickness. Each tile includes a flexible metallic substrate and an HTS coating atop the substrate. The tiles are attached via their corresponding substrates to the inside wall surfaces of the frame so that their corresponding HTS coatings are interiorly exposed. The attached tiles flexibly conform to curved surface areas, are snugly set with narrow seams therebetween, and cover at least approximately the entirety of the frame's inside wall surfaces. A filler material is applied to the seams. The resultant tile configuration is characterized by at least approximate levelness of the exposed HTS coating surfaces and the filled seams.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to charged particle accelerator devices more particularly to resonant cavity structures used in particle accelerator devices for sustaining high acceleration fields.

Particle accelerator devices such as high energy accelerators and free electron lasers FEL are designed to accelerate charged atomic particles such as ions protons or electrons. Acceleration of a beam of charged particles is traditionally accomplished using a synchronized linear radio frequency RF cavity array. Each cavity in such a linear array sustains a high intensity RF radiation field in order to generate a high acceleration field. A synchronized acceleration electric field Eis applied by each cavity along the linear charged particle beam trajectory. The injected charged particle beam acceleration is provided by the linear array whereby each cavity imparts an energy increment to the beam. When synchronized properly these increments add up to the desired high velocity at the end of the linear array.

To maximize the accelerating electric field E in each such RF cavity the cavity must sustain a high power electromagnetic field and a minimum of resistive losses at the cavity s walls. The purpose of using superconductor material in the cavities of conventional particle accelerator devices is to minimize wall losses thereby promoting long duty cycles. State of the art RF cavities are made of a low temperature superconductor such as niobium Nb . RF cavity arrays made of bulk Nb are commonly used for free electron lasers and large high energy physics research accelerators. Niobium is the only conventional superconductor that meets the requirements of small surface resistance high thermal conduction and ductility see Ruggero Vaglio RF Superconducting Cavities for Accelerators pp 447 473 H. Weinstock and M. Nisenoff Editors Kluwer Academic Publishers Dordrecht 2001. However by definition a low temperature superconductor material acts as a superconductor only at a low operation temperature the achievement of which requires liquid helium He cooling. Use of niobium for instance mandates an operation temperature T in the range T 2 4 K more commonly at T 2 K.

Critical requirements of a viable RF cavity superconductor material include low surface resistance high thermal conductivity some degree of ductility and amenability to fabrication of large cavity shapes characterized by round e.g. circular plan and oval like cross section commonly referred to as pillbox shapes. Among conventional superconductors niobium critical temperature T 9.2 K best matches these requirements hence state of the art RF cavities are niobium based made either of bulk Nb or Nb coated copper pre form. See Vaglio supra E. Chiaveri 13 1199 2003 P. Kneisel paper at the Eleventh Workshop on RF Superconductivity September 2003 Lubeck Germany available on compact disc .

Several design considerations determine the wall material surface morphology and overall shape of the cavity important among which are the following. Firstly heat losses should be minimized. If heat losses are sufficiently low operation is permitted at 100 duty cycle superconductor material is preferred for this reason. An additional advantage of a superconductor over a metal is that a superconductor s surface resistance scales with frequency f as f whereas a metal s surface resistance scales with frequency f as f see Kneisel supra. Secondly the magnetic field intensities at the cavity walls hot areas should be reduced so that they do not exceed the superconductor critical field. This consideration has led to pillbox shapes of cavities. Thirdly multipacting i.e. repeated emission of secondary electrons from imperfections at the cavity s walls should be reduced. This consideration implies the need to eliminate cavity surface protrusions as much as possible since it is at these protrusive locations where high local electric fields are present that lead to secondary electron emission. Consequently the cavity s surface is meticulously treated by electrical and chemical processes such as etching See Vaglio supra Chiaveri supra Kneisel supra in order to achieve maximum smoothness. Fourthly thermal stability should be achieved. Factors such as residual local surface imperfections and field transients can lead to localized heating that can quickly spread throughout the cavity and result in a breakdown. To efficiently diffuse these thermal instabilities the thermal conductivity of the cavity walls should be maximized while their surface resistance should be as low as possible. Fifthly the manufacturability of cavities is of great practical importance. The material e.g. superconductor must be amenable to the fabrication of structures having large non flat areas with some degree of elasticity for mechanical adjustments.

Among conventional superconductors niobium comes closest to the above materials requirements see Vaglio supra Chiaveri supra Kneisel supra. However as previously noted herein the low critical temperature Tof niobium mandates operation in the temperature range T 2 4 K. This low operation temperature requires a complex bulky and expensive liquid helium based cooling system. Furthermore the low thermodynamic critical field H 0.2 Tesla of niobium imposes constraints on practicable cavity shapes and on maximally achievable accelerating electric field E.

In view of the foregoing an object of the present invention is to provide a resonant cavity structure that is more efficient economical and versatile than conventional resonant cavity structures.

The present invention s radio frequency RF cavity device as typically embodied comprises a rigid structure and a plurality of flexible tiles. The rigid structure has an interior space and an inside surface bounding the interior space. Each flexible tile includes a substrate and a superconductor coating upon the substrate. Each flexible tile is coupled with the rigid structure so that its substrate adjoins a portion of the rigid structure s inside surface and so that its superconductor coating is exposed to the rigid structure s interior space. According to typical inventive fabrication of an inventive RF cavity device a frame is provided having an interior space and an inside surface bounding the interior space. Plural tiles are adhered to the frame so that each substrate adjoins a portion of the inside surface and each superconductor coating is exposed to the interior space. Typical inventive RF cavity device embodiments have at least one curved inside surface portion. One or more flexible tiles each flexibly conform to the curvature of the adjoining curved inside surface portion.

The present invention is typically embodied as a high performance RF cavity featuring an inner wall that is lined with flexible tiles each of which includes a coating surface layer of a high temperature superconductor HTS material such as magnesium diboride MgB . The term superconductor as used herein in the context of inventive practice broadly refers to either a pure superconductor or a doped superconductor. Inventive embodiments can vary in any of several respects including the following i the geometry size and shape of the inventive resonant cavity structure ii the superconductor material coatings of the tiles iii the number of tiles iv the individual geometries sizes and shapes of the tiles v the arrangement of the tiles. The terms resonant cavity and radio frequency cavity RF cavity are used interchangeably herein.

The present invention is typically practiced whereby the inventive resonant cavity structure is characterized by what is broadly referred to herein as a pillbox shape. An inventive resonant cavity can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous with respect to HTS materiality. According to the former inventive mode all of the tiles of an inventive resonant cavity include a coating of the same HTS material according to the latter inventive mode two or more tiles of an inventive resonant cavity differ in their respective HTS material coatings. The overall configuration layout of the tiles including their number contours and arrangement may be selected by an inventive practitioner in consideration of several criteria notable among which are those discussed hereinbelow.

Magnesium diboride MgB commonly designated MGB is a recently discovered superconductor having critical temperature T 39 K see P. Canfield and G. W. Crabtree March 2003 p 34 S. Souma et al. 423 65 2003 H. J. Choi et al. Nature 418 758 2002 April 2001 p 17. The recent discovery of MGB suggested to the present inventors the possibility of MGB based RF cavities. The present inventors recognized that MGB coated RF cavities can alleviate the need for liquid He cooling. The present inventors further recognized that the brittleness of MGB renders problematic the fabrication of such a cavity particularly because of curved surfaces. The present invention succeeds in overcoming the MGB brittleness obstacle by tiling the inner surface of an RF cavity with MGB coated metallic tiles. As compared with Nb based RF cavities MgB based RF cavities potentially afford equal or superior performance as well as lower manufacture and operation costs.

A tile suitable for inventive implementation typically includes a suitable metallic substrate and an HTS coating situated on the metallic substrate. The metallic substrate can be for instance a metal such as titanium aluminum or nickel or a metal alloy such as stainless steel. According to usual inventive practice the substrates are metallic but inventive practice can provide for substrates that are non metallic. A key attribute of the present invention s tile substrate is its sufficient flexibility e.g. bendability or pliability for permitting coupling thereof with a non flat surface which can manifest a significant degree of curvature depending on the inventive embodiment various metallic materials and even some non metallic materials e.g. composites may meet this flexibility criterion. A key attribute of the present invention s tile superconductor coating is its ability to flex e.g. bend in concert with its tile substrate so as to retain or substantially retain its superconducting character. According to typical inventive practice the HTS coated metallic tiles are relatively large macroscopic high in quality flexible and of uniform thickness and are adhered in a strategically configured manner onto the inside surface of the inventive resonant cavity.

The present invention s MGB coated metal tiles can be fabricated via techniques that have recently become known particularly those techniques involving state of the art MGB film growth technology. For instance in the following paper incorporated herein by reference B. H. Moeckly et al. describe a methodology that can be practiced for making the present invention s MGB coated metallic tiles B. H. Moeckley and W. S. Ruby Growth of High Quality Large Area MgBThin Films by Reactive Evaporation Volume 19 pages L21 L24 14 Mar. 2006 . The inventive concepts are applicable to HTS materials other than MGB and allow for hybrid inventive cavity designs in which not all of the tiles are coated with the same HTS material.

As elaborated upon in the next few paragraphs the present invention s novel MGB based resonant cavities potentially afford distinct advantages over conventional Nb based resonant cavities in terms of material properties including the following critical temperature surface resistance upper critical field lower critical field thermal conductivity material cost substrate compatibility.

Since MGB has a high critical temperature typical embodiments of the present invention s MGB based cavity can operate in the range T 5 20 K. This operation temperature can be accomplished by a cooling system based on gaseous helium for instance rather than liquid helium. A gaseous helium cooling system would carry substantial savings in terms of footprint power consumption simplified logistics and enhanced reliability thus comparing favorably with a liquid helium cooling system which is needed for niobium based cavities.

Recent data obtained by the present inventors imply that the surface resistance of MGB is comparable to that of Nb films at the same reduced temperature T T and is lower than that of Nb films at the same absolute temperature. This property of low surface resistance of MGB entails significant savings in the idle cooling system load.

At T 0 K the upper critical field Hof MGB is either 16 Tesla or 5 Tesla depending on the direction of the field as MGB is anisotropic see Canfield et al. supra Souma et al. supra Choi et al. supra April 2001 supra. For doped MGB significantly higher fields have been measured see C. Ferdeghini et al. 15 3234 2005 C. Tanatini et al. 15 3223 2005 V. Braccini et al. 71 012504 2005 M. Angst et al. 71 144512 2005 A. Gurevich 67 184515 2003 . By comparison in Nb H 0.2 T T. Van Duzer and C. W. Turner Elsevier New York 1981. These data indicate that MGB based cavities can potentially sustain very high acceleration fields.

The thermal conductivity of MGB at T 10 K is 25 W mK rising steeply with temperature see M. Putti et al. 16 188 2003 . By comparison the thermal conductivity of Nb at T 3 K is 10 20 W m K see T. Van Duzer and C. W. Turner Elsevier New York 1981. These figures imply that the thermal conductivity of MGB is comparable to that of Nb at a substantially higher temperature.

The lower critical field in MGB is estimated at H 150 Oe see M. Tinkham 2nd Edition McGraw Hill Inc. New York 996 page 154. By comparison the lower critical field in Nb is estimated at H 33 Oe. This indicates a reduction of vortex penetration into MGB at elevated power levels and hence a reduction of nonlinearity associated with extrinsic vortex motion nonlinearity as compared to Nb.

MGB represents a simple composition of common elements and Nb is a relatively uncommon element therefore the commercial price of MGB is considerably less than that of Nb. As for substrate compatibility some metallic substrates such as nickel Ni and stainless steel have been found to be compatible with MGB deposition.

MGB is a brittle material see Canfield et al. supra. While other material properties of MGB lend attractiveness to the present invention s MGB based RF cavities a major impediment to the realization of an inventive device is the brittleness of MGB. MGB is classified as a boride ceramic and as such is granular in nature. This property of MGB which is common to other high temperature superconductors such as yttrium barium copper oxide YBCO poses a challenge for coating large non flat surface areas with a high quality MGB film. The present invention meets this challenge. Rather than coat large non flat surfaces with a continuous high quality MGB film the present invention tiles large non flat surfaces with MGB coated tiles each comprising a flexible metallic substrate and a high quality MGB film deposited thereon. The present invention thus avails itself of the elasticity of MGB. Inventive principles can be applied to other known or yet to be discovered high temperature superconductors regardless of their character in terms of brittleness. YBCO for instance is a candidate HTS film material for inventive practice but it is more difficult and expensive to make than MGB in the current state of the technology.

In a sense the present invention shifts the focus from achieving a high quality surface over an entire cavity interior to achieving a high quality surface on individual tiles of smaller areas this represents a propitious shift of focus as the former is considerably more difficult than the latter. The higher operation temperatures greater than T 2 4 K of the present invention translate to substantial reductions in the cost and complexity of the helium cooling because gaseous He cooling can be implemented vice liquid He cooling. Inventive utilization of tiles may also result in reduced costs. Inventive practice may be expected to have associated therewith a high acceleration field E 12 MV m or higher based on current data . The present invention s hybrid cavity embodiments in which at least two different superconductor materials are used as tile coatings may expand the possibilities of inventive practice for instance with respect to shapes of inventive cavities because of the inherent differences in the material properties of the different superconductor materials. Inventive practice lends itself to modularity and to exploration of new shapes that are easier to manufacture.

Other objects advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring now to through cavity preforms that are suitable for inventive practice are typically characterized by conventional pillbox shapes. The terms cavity preform and cold cavity are used synonymously herein to refer to the superconductor less frame of an RF cavity i.e. the basic RF cavity structure absent superconductor material. A cavity preform is typically a rigid hollow walling structure and is typically made of a metallic metal or metal alloy material although it could be made of another e.g. ceramic or composite suitable material. The term pillbox is broadly used herein to describe a shape that is cylindrical or generally cylindrical.

As depicted in through pillbox cavity preform is characterized by lateral symmetry straight and or curved with respect to its geometric planar bisector b with respect to which its geometric axis a is perpendicular. As further depicted in through a pillbox cavity preform is characterized a profile in the direction of its geometric axis a that has indicia of rectangularity and or ovality. An inventive pillbox shaped cavity preform is usually of relatively short axial length thus describing or generally describing a disk shape akin to a hockey puck. 

According to the depiction of pillbox cavity preform geometric planar bisector b is in parallel with the geometric plane described by the page. As illustrated in a pillbox cavity preform is characterized by a circular circumferential symmetry with respect to its geometric axis a. Pillbox cavity preforms and are each characterized by circularity in perpendicular relation to its geometric axis a that is each pillbox cavity preform has a circular circumferential portion with circular geometric cross sections of either constant or varying sizes in geometric planes perpendicular to geometric axis a. may be considered to portray either one of the two axial ends of a cavity preform which is hollow. Each axial end has a small central aperture that is aligned with geometric axis a thereby permitting passage along geometric axis a and through cavity preform of a beam of subatomic particles e.g. protons or electrons.

A geometric pillbox shape can have an axially directed profile that is entirely rectilinear such as shown in or both rectilinear and curvilinear such as shown in and or entirely curvilinear such as shown in . The scope of possible geometric pillbox shapes that are suitable for inventive practice runs the gamut with varying gradations of curvature from pure rectilinearity of its axially directed profile through combined rectilinearity and curvilinearity of its axially directed profile to pure curvilinearity of its axially directed profile. The possible geometric pillbox shapes are also variable in terms of the aspect ratio e.g. ratio of length along axis a to width along plane b of the axially directed profile.

For purposes of this discussion it is assumed that the walls of a pillbox cavity preform are each at least substantially uniform in thickness and hence the inside and outside surfaces of the walls are at least substantially correspondent in terms of their respective shapes. The walls may be but need not be equal or approximately equal in thickness vis vis each other. The term wall as used herein in the context of describing a cavity preform denotes a wall portion of the overall walling structure represented by the cavity preform and is not intended to necessarily suggest either structural discreteness or structural distinctness vis vis any other wall that is included in the overall walling structure. The overall walling structure described by a cavity preform is considered herein to comprise an axial longitudinal i.e. circumferential wall and two axial end walls .

Pillbox cavity preform shown in and is cylindrical in the strictest geometric sense having a rectangular profile pillbox cavity preform has two flat axial end walls and an axial longitudinal circumferential wall that is straight in the axial direction a. Pillbox cavity preform shown in and is generally cylindrical having a rectangular oval profile pillbox cavity preform has two flat axial end walls and an axial longitudinal circumferential wall that is curved e.g. manifesting a U shaped curve in the axial direction a. Pillbox cavity preform shown in and is generally cylindrical having an oval rectangular profile pillbox cavity preform has two curved e.g. convex axial end walls and an axial longitudinal circumferential wall that is straight in the axial direction a. Pillbox cavity preform shown in and is generally cylindrical having an oval or approximately oval profile pillbox cavity preform has two curved e.g. convex axial end walls and an axial longitudinal circumferential wall that is curved e.g. manifesting a U shaped curve in the axial direction a. Pillbox cavity preforms and each represent a kind of biconvex shape but are distinguishable insofar as pillbox has an axially level circumference whereas pillbox has an axially rounded circumference.

As further discussed hereinbelow a variety of design choices can be made by the inventive practitioner with regard to the shape of the pillbox cavity preform . Many cavity preforms will be selected in inventive practice so as to be more akin to cavity preforms and which are generally cylindrical having a degree of roundedness along longitudinal axis a and or along bisector plane b than to cavity preform which is purely cylindrical . The angular junctures between the circumferential wall and the end walls of a rectilinearly profiled e.g. rectangular pillbox preform such as illustrated by pillbox cavity preform will tend to result in multipacting at these locations. On the other hand the relatively high curvatures characterizing an oval profile pillbox preform such as illustrated by pillbox cavity preform may exceed the limits to which the present invention s tiles may flex without compromising their superconductive character.

The afore noted publication by B. H. Moeckley and W. S. Ruby entitled Growth of High Quality Large Area MgBThin Films by Reactive Evaporation discloses the in situ growth of large area high quality magnesium diboride films deposited on various thin substrates single crystal sapphire polycrystalline alumina silicon stainless steel etc. up to four inches in width diameter via a methodology that includes reactive evaporation deposition. Moeckley et al. refer to their MGB film upon substrate combinations as wafers. It is reasonable to infer from Moeckley et al. that various single crystalline polycrystalline metallic and semiconductor materials See Moeckley et al. Abstract other than those specifically disclosed by Moeckley et al. can be used as substrate materials according to their wafer fabrication method. It is also reasonable to suppose that Moeckley et al. s fabrication principles may be applicable when a superconductor material other than MGB is the film upon the substrate. Large area e.g. 2 4 diameter width MGB film upon substrate wafers have recently begun to be manufactured on a quasi commercial basis. A typical wafer in accordance with the teachings of Moeckley et al. includes a flexible metallic substrate stainless steel titanium etc. and a high quality MGB thin film deposited on the flexible metallic substrate.

According to the wafer fabrication method of Moeckley et al. the substrate is mounted on a rotating shaft in an evacuated growth chamber thereby exposing the substrate in the course of a revolution to both a boron B gun and magnesium Mg vapor confined to a pocket heater. Moeckley et al. s method typically yields a film having a sharp superconducting transition at the critical temperature e.g. 1 K width at T 39 K a smooth surface having a low amount of surface roughness e.g. 4 nm and a low level of nonlinearity. By comparison the typical inside surface roughness of a state of the art Nb cavity after surface treatment is about 100 nm. Moreover the low power surface resistance of an MGB film upon substrate wafer according to Moeckley et al. is comparable to that of a state of the art Nb cavity.

The present invention as typically embodied utilizes flexible HTS coated metallic planar members to line cover at least a portion of the overall interior surface of a cavity preform. These inventive planar members are also referred to herein as inventive tiles. A suitable adhesive material e.g. a suitable glue paste epoxy or cement is used to effect adherence bonding of the inventive tiles to the inside surface of the cavity preform. A preferred method of making inventive tiles is the afore described method of making MGB film upon substrate wafers according to Moeckley et al.

With reference to through inventive HTS coated metallic tiles are used to cover the inside surfaces and of walls and respectively of an RF cavity preform . Each inventive tile includes a metallic layer for being adhered to the interior surface of an RF cavity preform and an HTS e.g. MGB layer for being exposed on the inside the RF cavity preform . If an inventive tile is fabricated according to the afore discussed wafer fabrication method of Moeckley et al. then metallic layer is the substrate and MGB layer is the coating upon the substrate.

According to typical inventive practice the inventive tiles are made flat planar for instance as shown in through . Typically each tile is of uniform or substantially uniform thickness. Further typically all of the tiles utilized for a particular preform are of equal or approximately equal thickness. Non uniformity and or inequality of individual and or comparative tile thicknesses are also possible in inventive practice. As illustrated in the flatness when not subjected to flexural strain of a typical inventive tile facilitates its adherence to a flat interior surface region of the walling structure of a pillbox cavity preform . A pillbox cavity preform usually defines a geometric circle in geometric planes perpendicularly across the geometric axis a therefore generally speaking any entirely flat interior surface region that a cavity preform may have would be a flat surface region F of the interior surface of one of the two axial end walls . Adhesive material is applied to the flat metallic substrate surface of the inventive tile and or to the flat inside surface region F of the axial wall s inside surface . The inventive tile is then pressed upon the flat inside surface region F to effect adherence with very little or no flexing bending of inventive tile taking place.

As illustrated in an inventive tile as typically embodied is sufficiently flexible bendable to flex bend in conformance with a non flat e.g. curved interior surface region of a cavity preform . The inventive tile shown in is being adhered to a curved region of either the interior surface or one of the two interior surfaces . Adhesive material is applied to the metallic substrate surface of the inventive tile and or to a non flat inside surface region of cavity preform . This non flat inside surface region can be either a non flat inside surface region N of the inside surface of one of the two axial walls s or a non flat inside surface region N of the inside surface of the circumferential wall . To effect adherence the inventive tile is flexed before and or during the pressing thereof upon the non flat inside surface region N or N.

The flexibility of MGB wafers fabricated according to Moeckley et al. is an essential attribute for performing inventive tiling of non flat inner surface regions N and N of an RF cavity preform . While the existing data on the elasticity of magnesium diboride is scant whatever data is available bodes well for inventive practice. As elaborated upon hereinbelow supporting data is provided by Moeckley et al. and Cheggour et al.

As disclosed by B. H. Moeckley et al. in a presentation at the Ninth Symposium on High Temperature Superconductors in High Frequency Fields 25 28 Jun. 2006 Cardiff United Kingdom small wafers of MGB coated upon nickel Ni were checked for variations of the critical temperature due to their flexure. After the wafers were flexed to a degree that corresponds to curvature radius of about 0.5 cm no variation in critical temperature was observed. This curvature radius depends on the sample thickness nevertheless no systematic quantified data exists on the flexibility of such wafers.

Moreover with reference to recent data concerning MGB wires shows that the dc critical current remains practically unchanged under stress of 

Although the inventive tiles shown in through are shown to have a rectangular planar shape plan form it is to be understood that an inventive tile can have practically any planar shape since the suitability of an inventive tile s planar shape depends primarily on the location and contour of the RF cavity preform s surface region to which the inventive tile is to be adhered. An inventive tile can have a plan form that is rectilinear curvilinear or both regular or irregular symmetrical or nonsymmetrical. For instance an inventive tile s plan form can be a regular polygon of any number of sides greater than two an irregular polygon of any number of sides greater than two a regular or symmetrical closed curved figure e.g. a circle or an ellipse an irregular or asymmetrical closed curved figure a regular or symmetrical closed figure having at least one straight portion and at least one curved portion an irregular or asymmetrical closed figure having at least one straight portion and at least one curved portion etc.

Now referring to through plural HTS coated metallic tiles are inventively adhered to the interior surfaces of an RF cavity preform in accordance with individual and relational geometries and an overall layout that are judiciously chosen by the inventive practitioner. As depicted in and cavity preform includes two opposite axial end walls and a circumferential wall . Each axial end wall has a small central aperture and an inside surface . The sizes of the apertures shown in figures herein are exaggerated for illustrative purposes. Circumferential wall has an inside surface . The two opposite axial end inside surfaces and the circumferential inside surface circumscribe enclose an interior space void .

Although and through more strictly correspond to the rectangularly profiled cavity preform shown in solid line in the skilled artisan who reads the instant disclosure will appreciate the like applicability of inventive principles to curvedly or partially curvedly profiled cavity performs such as shown in dotted line in .

Inventive practice generally favors placement of the inventive tiles so as to render the seams as tightly or snugly as possible. According to typical inventive practice the tiles are closely situated with respect to each other so as to form narrow seams between different pairs of tiles . The inner layer of the inventive RF cavity device includes not only the tiles but also filler material in the seams . The tiles and the filler material combine so that the inner layer has an at least substantially even character.

Tight fitting of highly irregularly shaped inventive tiles such as shown in may be difficult to achieve in inventive practice because of the complex shapes and interrelationships that must be taken into consideration nevertheless a relatively complicated configuration generally along the lines of that shown in may be desirable for an inventive practitioner in order to minimize the presence of seams in the higher intensity zones of the magnetic field that is expected to be generated when the inventive RF cavity device is implemented in the context of a particular particle acceleration application.

In general the tiles of a particular inventive RF cavity may be selected by the inventive practitioner to vary in terms of any of several characteristics depending on the circumstances of their usage. According to some embodiments of the present invention s interiorly tiled cavity not all tiles of the inventive cavity include the same superconductor material an inventive strategy referred to herein as superconductor hybridization. In addition or alternative to superconductor hybridization tiles of a given inventive RF cavity can be rendered to distinguish from one another in one or more respects other than superconductor material including but not limited to planar shape through thickness and surface roughness. through FIG. illustrate by way of example how the planar shapes of the tiles can be varied within a given inventive cavity . Moreover tiles having the same superconductor can be distinguished from each other in terms of their respective doping or lack thereof.

Furthermore inventive practice permits utilization of two or more types of suitable materials metallic or otherwise e.g. composite for the flexible layers . A suitable metallic material is generally preferred for the tile layers firstly because it is flexible and secondly because it is thermally conductive and thus serves to dissipate excessive heat especially in the event that one or more hot spots exist in the inventive RF cavity .

As an example of an inventive cavity having selectively varied tiles the tiles that are exposed to a high magnetic field may be selected to have a coating layer of judiciously doped MGB which is known to have very high critical fields. Further the tiles that are exposed to a high electric field may be selected to have an exceptionally smooth coating layer . In addition the tiles that are situated at relatively flat areas of the cavity preform may be selected to have yet another distinguishing characteristic such as being composed of a different superconductor e.g. YBCO .

The present invention s flexible HTS coated tiles can include MGB and or one or more other high temperature superconductors as constituents of the HTS layers . and illustrate but one example of diverse modes of inventive practice involving superconductor hybridization. As shown in and some HTS coated tiles include an HTS layer which is composed of MGB while other HTS coated tiles include an HTS layer which is composed of YBCO . For given applications inventive hybrid HTS RF cavities such as exemplified in and can potentially outperform inventive uniform HTS RF cavities particularly if modularization is effected.

There is practically no limit to the sizes of the inventive RF cavities or of the HTS coated tiles that line their interiors. For instance the wafer fabrication method of Moeckley et al. permits scalability to larger wafers Moeckely et al. s wafers can be scaled up in size by scaling up the dimensions of the growth chamber.

With regard to fabrication of inventive RF cavities the inventive method is typically practiced so as to provide a cavity preform of selected shape and dimensions and to completely line all of the interior walls of the cavity preform with plural tiles . As completed a typical inventively made from scratch RF cavity represents a four layered material system. Starting from the inside and proceeding outward the first innermost layer includes the HTS coating layers of their respective tiles the first layer also includes some filler material in the seams . Adjacent to the first layer the second layer includes the metallic substrate layers of their respective tiles the second layer also includes some filler material in the seams . Adjacent to the second layer the third layer includes the adhesive material . Adjacent to the third layer is the outermost layer which includes the cavity preform . In a sense the fourth layer is the outer layer and the first and second layers are sub layers of an overall tile inclusive inner layer of the inventive RF cavity .

Construction from scratch of inventive RF cavities typically provides for lining the entire or substantially the entire inside surface e.g. practically every square inch of the interior walls of a cavity preform . Alternatively inventive construction from scratch can provide for lining a part or parts e.g. one or more areas of the cavity preform s inside surface.

As an alternative to constructing inventive RF cavities from scratch the present invention can be practiced so as to retrofit existing conventional cavities such as Nb cavities. As inventive retrofitting is typically practiced one or more HTS coated tiles e.g. MGB coated tiles are selectively placed at strategic locations on one or more interior walls of an Nb cavity especially where the radiation fields are particularly large. According to this inventive approach to selective tile placement only a portion or portions of the inside surface of the retrofit style inventive cavity is are the HTS tile material the remainder of the inside surface of the retrofit style inventive cavity is the Nb cavity s own Nb low temperature superconductor material. An alternative inventive approach is to cover the entire inside surface of the conventional cavity so as to produce a retrofit style inventive cavity in which the entire inside surface is the HTS tile material.

A conventional cavity structure serves as the frame for inventive tiling in order to create a retrofit style inventive cavity similarly as a cavity preform structure serves as the frame for inventive tiling in order to create a made from scratch inventive cavity . Furthermore a retrofit style inventive cavity represents a four layer material system in those areas in which tiles are present similarly as a made from scratch inventive cavity represents a four layer material system. Regardless of whether inventive practice involves making inventive RF cavities from scratch or by retrofitting existing RF cavities modularization or standardization of HTS coated tiles can facilitate inventive designs and result in high performance at significant cost savings. Modular HTS coated tiles of a variety of geometric and constitutional descriptions can be made commercially available to facilitate inventive practice and to encourage innovativeness of inventive cavity designs.

As general guidance for the inventive practitioner the seams between the tiles should be minimized in terms of their number and dimensions e.g. lengths and thicknesses of seams . Expressed another way the percentage of the inventive cavity s inside surfaces and that is covered with tiles as distinguished from inter tile seams should be maximized. In addition the flexibility of the tiles should be maximized especially in terms of the shapes and materials of the tiles . By way of elaboration according to the inventive guidelines further discussed hereinbelow design parameters that should be optimized include i the shape of the inventive RF cavity ii the shapes including sizes of the tiles and iii the layout of the tiles on the cavity inside walls and .

Generally speaking the shape of the inventive RF cavity when it is implemented in association with or as a component of particle accelerative apparatus determines the magnetic field strength distribution inside the inventive RF cavity . In particular the inventive RF cavity shape determines the areas and locations of the inside surfaces and where the magnitude of the magnetic field H is high. Due to the considerably higher critical field of MGB as compared with Nb RF cavity shapes that are unacceptable for an Nb based RF cavity may be admissible for an MGB based RF cavity.

The inventive RF cavity shape should be selected by the inventive practitioner so as to avoid any interior wall region having a radius of curvature that is smaller than the tolerable curvature of the superconducting tiles in terms of flexing bending so as to retain superconductive integrity. Based on calculations performed by the present inventors with regard to cavity designs in the Brookhaven National Laboratory the present inventors believe that this constraint will be easily met throughout the cavity walls of the vast majority of inventive RF cavity designs.

For a given inventive RF cavity shape a tradeoff should be struck between the number of tiles and therefore their sizes and the degrees of strain that the tiles must sustain. In other words the layout of the tiles should aim to minimize the number of tiles while avoiding any superconductive compromise of any tile due to excessive strain. As a general rule a configuration of fewer and hence larger tiles will have associated therewith a greater strain on individual tiles conversely a configuration of more and hence smaller tiles will have associated therewith a lesser strain on individual tiles .

For a given inventive RF cavity shape the tiles should be shaped and laid out so as to locate the seams which are between the tiles as close as possible to the areas where the magnetic field is low. In a typical inventive RF cavity the standing waves necessarily have nodes places of zero fields at the surface of the inventive RF cavity . At the nodes no electrical current flows. Generally speaking it is a recommended inventive design strategy of the tile configuration that the seams conform to the locations or distribution of the nodes.

The inventive practitioner should consider the above factors and tradeoffs seeking to optimize the shape of the inventive RF cavity the shapes including sizes of the tiles and the layout of the tiles . A detailed quantitative analysis can be performed by the inventive practitioner of the magnetic field distribution for each prospective inventive cavity shape. For instance consider the two extreme cases of an RF cavity preform having a a purely rectangular cross section such as shown in and by solid line in and b a purely oval cross section such as shown in and by dotted line in . The purely rectangular cavity preform shape tends to simplify the shapes and layout of the tiles that are inventively bonded to the inside surfaces but tends to be problematic due to multipacting at the sharp corners. On the other hand the purely oval cavity preform shape tends to minimize multipacting but tends to impose greater strains on the tiles and in larger surface areas. The inventive practitioner can balance these considerations for contemplated inventive RF cavities and can arrive at interesting inventive RF cavity designs.

Once the entire interior surface of the RF cavity preform has been tiled so as to form an inventive RF cavity surface treatment is typically needed in inventive practice to smooth out the areas along and around the seams situated between the tiles . The seams can be filled in with a suitable low temperature filler material especially one that will not contribute to multipacting. Examples of filler materials that may be suitable for inventive practice include varnish resin epoxy superconductor powder e.g. magnesium diboride powder highly conductive metal powder e.g. silver powder highly conductive metal welding material e.g. silver welding material etc. The filler material must have a durable low temperature quality in the sense of being capable of maintaining its compositional and physical integrity at the very cold temperatures associated with typical inventive practice.

Application by an inventive practitioner of filler material to seams may be analogous to application by a tile layer of grout material to seams between the ceramic tiles of an ordinary bathroom floor generally the common objective is fill crevices between discrete pieces. Not unlike conventional grout or grout like materials the present invention s filler material is applied to the seams and excess filler material is removed. This final cavity surface smoothing stage is not expected to be difficult since the surface roughness of the HTS film layer is usually very small and the thickness of the metallic substrate layer as well as the smoothness of the cavity preform inside surface can usually be tightly controlled. Techniques and protocols analogous to those traditionally used in association with conventional Nb based RF cavities can be used in association with the present invention s HTS based RF cavities . Typical surface treatment of conventional Nb based RF cavities is electro chemical in nature and employs high pressure rinsing see Vaglio supra E. Chiaveri supra P. Kneisel supra.

As shown in and some tiles that are suitable for inventive practice include a substrate layer and a superconductor layer that are contiguous to each other that is with nothing therebetween. Reference now being made to and some tiles that are suitable for inventive practice also include an intermediate buffer layer which typically is much thinner than the substrate layer and the superconductor layer . As shown in and thin buffer layer is directly between substrate layer and superconductor layer . The purpose of the buffer layer is to avoid interdiffusion between the substrate layer and the superconductor layer . For instance the present inventors have found that molybdenum Mo can be used as a buffer layer between a copper substrate layer and a magnesium diboride layer .

Although flexible tiles are frequently embodied as flat and flexible tiles inventive practice can provide for flexible tiles that are non flat non planar . Broadly speaking the tiles that may be suitable for inventive practice span the theoretical gamut of geometric shapes of geometric surface portions that may be excised from geometric solids of any description. Non flat flexible tiles may be especially propitious for lining the interiors of cavity preforms that are more extremely curved.

For instance a flexible tile can be defined by the geometric frustum of any of a variety of conventionally defined three dimensional geometric shapes including but not limited to the following sphere prolate spheroid circular cylinder non circular e.g. elliptical or oval cylinder cone. The term frustum as used herein denotes a slice of a three dimensional geometric shape. A frustum can be a slice formed on either side of a geometric plane that passes through the three dimensional geometric shape. Alternatively a frustum can be a slice formed between two geometric planes parallel or non parallel that pass through the three dimensional geometric shape.

The two main inventive configurational modes of lining interior preform surfaces with frustum shaped tiles are horizontal orientation mode and vertical orientation mode. With reference to the interior wall surfaces of preform are shown completely lined with various horizontally oriented frustum shaped tiles as follows. In each wall end the inside surface is lined with a tile at the end tip and with two tiles near the end tip. In the wall circumference i.e. along the medial length the inside surface is lined with four tiles . Tiles each describe a cap shaped frustum formed by cutting through a sphere or a prolate spheroid using one geometric plane. Tiles each describe a closed strip shaped frustum formed by cutting through either a sphere or a prolate spheroid or a cone using two parallel geometric planes. Tiles each describe a closed strip shaped frustum of a different kind formed by cutting through a circular cylinder or a non circular cylinder using two parallel geometric planes.

As also illustrated in an alternative inventive approach to horizontal orientation mode is vertical orientation mode. The interior wall surfaces of preform can be lined with various vertically oriented frustum shaped tiles . Like horizontally oriented tiles vertically oriented tiles each describe a closed strip shaped frustum formed by cutting through either a sphere or a prolate spheroid or a cone using two parallel geometric planes. Although two adjacent vertically oriented frustum shaped tiles viz. tiles are depicted readily envisioned from are the various ways in which vertically oriented frustum shaped tiles can be shaped and placed to line the entirety of the cavity surface interior. Inventive practice may tend to prefer vertical orientation mode over horizontal orientation mode in terms of minimizing the amounts of current crossing the seams.

The tiles depicted in are merely illustrative of diverse frusta that can be adhered to the inside walls of cavity preforms and are not suggestive of inventive configurational design preference. For instance the relatively high number of and relatively close separations between the parallel seams as shown may tend to be counterproductive to effective operation of an inventive RF cavity . In this regard longitudinally wider tiles than shown in may be more suitable for more inventive embodiments.

An advantage of a frustum shaped tile over a flat tile is that the former can be selected to have an original shape that is conformal or nearly conformal with respect to a large non flat interior surface area of a preform . A frustum shaped tile is inherently capable of covering large surface areas at least substantially conformally. In contrast originally flat tiles always need to flex a least a little in order to be conformal with respect to a non flat interior surface area. Furthermore it will frequently be the case that fewer frustum shaped tiles than flat tiles will be needed to cover the same large curved surface area. Generally speaking less flexibility will be required for frustum shaped tiles than for flat tiles and fewer seams will be associated with a configuration of frustum shaped tiles than of flat tiles .

The present inventors believe that the wafer fabrication teachings of Moeckley et al. are practicable for making frustum shaped tiles that are suitable for inventive practice. Chamber modification will likely be required for accommodating most frustum shaped substrates upon which superconductor film is to be deposited but the basic principles of Moeckley et al. s method will be applicable.

Reference now being made to according to frequent inventive practice plural inventive pillbox shaped cavities are implemented so as to be linearly arrayed so that each inventive pillbox shaped cavity has its geometric axis a aligned with the trajectory of the charged particle beam in the charged particle accelerative device . Each inventive RF cavity has two holes on geometric axis a to permit passage of the charged particle beam along geometric axis a. Each inventive RF cavity has associated therewith an electric field E that is coincident with geometric axis a and that is pointed in one direction and further has associated therewith a magnetic field H that is oriented vis vis electric field E in accordance with the right hand rule. As beam travels along geometric axis a each inventive RF cavity through which beam passes serves to accelerate beam in the same direction due to the influence of the electric field E. Thus as highly diagrammatically depicted in beam is progressively accelerated in turn by inventive RF cavities and .

The tile designs shown in through and are not intended to suggest that same or similar designs are recommended for inventive practice. Rather the portrayed tile designs serve to illustrate the variety of geometric shapes and arrangements that the present invention can implement. In fact the inventive tile designs shown in through and in particular would tend to be undesirable because of significantly less than optimal minimization of the amounts of currents traversing the seams . The inventive tile design shown in through would more likely be suitable for given applications because of its small number of seams .
