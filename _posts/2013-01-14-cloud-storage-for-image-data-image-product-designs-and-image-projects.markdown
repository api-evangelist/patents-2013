A computer illustrated in represents an exemplified hardware setup for executing software that allows a user to perform tasks such as communicating with other computer users accessing various computer resources and viewing creating or otherwise manipulating electronic content that is any combination of text images movies music or other sounds animations 3D virtual worlds and links to other objects. The system includes various input output I O devices mouse keyboard display and a computer having a central processor unit CPU an I O unit and a memory that stores data and various programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs . The computer also typically includes non volatile memory e.g. flash RAM a hard disk drive and or a floppy disk or other removable storage media and a communications card or device e.g. a modem or network adapter for exchanging data with a network via a communications link such as a cable modem DSL service or wireless Internet connection. The computer of also can be connected to various peripheral I O devices. One of the more popular of such peripheral devices is a digital camera . The digital camera enables users to take pictures i.e. images which are saved in memory within the digital camera in a digital format. After taking and storing the images the user can connect the digital camera to a computer in order to upload the digital images to the computer s disk drive or other non volatile memory . The user can also wirelessly transfer digital images in the digital camera to the computer . Once the digital images are uploaded to the computer the user can erase the digital images from the memory of the digital camera so that the user can take and store additional images using the digital camera . Typically the digital camera is connected to the computer only while the user is uploading images to the computer s disk drive or other non volatile memory . Once the digital images are stored on the computer a user can perform various operations on them. For example an image viewer application can be used to view the images. A photo editing application can also be used to touch up or otherwise modify the images. The computer can communicate via Internet with a server provided by a service provider such as Shutterfly Inc. A user operating the computer can upload or download images between the computer and the server . The user can also electronically share his or her images facilitated by the service provider.

It should be noted that the computer can exist in other configurations from the example shown in and described above. The computer can include a mobile device such as a smart phone a wireless enabled mobile computer such as a laptop computer or a tablet computer.

Although large numbers of images are frequently captured by digital cameras people often are not aware of the types of customized digital enabled imaging products that are available from image service providers such as Shutterfly Inc. Customizable image products can include photobooks photo calendars photo greeting cards photo stationeries photo mugs photo T shirt and so on which can provide significant enhanced ways for preserving people s treasured memories in addition to viewing images on electronic displays.

Additionally significant obstacles exist even for people who are aware of the availability of customizable image products. The design of a photobook for example can take significant amount of time and effort. A user has to select photos for many pages including a cover page. The user needs to select a format and a style for the photobook. The user needs to design or select layout for each page sort images for different pages and place images onto individual pages. The photobook design can take many iterative steps such as selecting suitable images selecting layout selecting images for each page add text which can often take hours to complete.

Once the user approves a design the photobook can be made according to the design locally by a printer connected to the computer or remotely by the imaging service provider at a printing facility .

Referring to a photobook can be made available to a user in the following general process. It should be noted that the process can include substeps within each step and other steps not shown in . A group of images are identified by a computer system such as the computer or the server step . The images can be received in a group in an upload from a computer device e.g. the computer to the computer system e.g. the server or from a digital camera to a computer e.g. the computer . The images can form a group when the images are shared in an electronic message from a first user e.g. operating the computer to a second user via a computer server e.g. the server . The images can be identified when a group of images are selected for printing. The images can also be identified when the images are placed in an electronic folder or an electronic album for an occasion or event or simply for collecting pictures of a theme or interest which can be called a picture picker . As shown in a user interface e.g. a web browser displays an image album that can have an album name such as Graduation Celebration and a plurality of images . The image album can include several pages of images that a user can navigate to and view by clicking arrow buttons . Furthermore images may be tagged by a user or the service provider by labeled such as Hawaiian Vacation Soccer Team Birthday Party Favorite etc. A group of images can be identified when they are tagged by a common label such as Hawaiian Vacation .

The computer system then determines if the number of images is within a predetermined range step . For example the threshold for the number of images in the group can be 20 i.e. the predetermined range is 20 or higher . If the images in the group are within the predetermined range the computer system automatically selects a style and a format for a photobook step . The styles of photobooks can include for example romance seasonal every day vacation travel wedding baby kids birthday school memories sports Mother s day holiday etc. each of which can include more detailed styles. A style of a photobook can specify the theme of the photobook such as colors the background themes the patterns the picture frames the text font positions of the text and images on the inner pages as well as covers of the photobook. The format of a photobook can include the size e.g. 5 7 8 8 12 12 etc. the paper stock materials for the pages and the cover the type of binding and the finish of the photobook.

In some embodiments the predetermined range can depend on how the group of images is selected whether they are selected for printing or for electronic share or placed in a single electronic folder or album or received in an image upload or tagged by a same label. For example the threshold number can be 15 for the images that are selected for printing and 20 for the images that are selected for electronic sharing. The different threshold image numbers for different image aggregation sources is based on the observation that users conducting different image operations often have different degrees of interests in seeing the design and making a physical image based product such as a photobook. The above described flexibility in image threshold numbers can provide service best suitable to different segments of users.

The style and the format of the photobook can have default selections such as everyday for the photobook style and 8 by 8 hardcover for the photobook format. In some embodiments the style and the format of the photobook can be selected based on knowledge of the images in the group. Specifically an image property can be extracted from the group of identified images. For example if the images are identified by a common tag label Hawaii Vacation a photobook style for vacation or specifically for Hawaiian vacation may be automatically selected. In another example if the images identified are in an electronic album called Molly s Birthday Party a birthday photobook style can be automatically selected. In another example the album name in which the images are identified can be used to automatically select a photobook style such as a Graduation photobook style .

The computer system automatically produces a design incorporating the identified images using the automatically selected photobook style and format step . It should be noted that the photobook design using the group of identified images and the associated selections of photobook style and formats are proactively and automatically implemented by the computer system without receiving a request from a user. The approach described in the present systems and methods is different from conventional photobook creation processes wherein users initiate projects to design photobooks. As described above conventional photobook making methods require awareness and familiarity of the photobooks by the users. The projects of creating photobooks can be very time consuming.

The proactively and automatically created design of the photobook can be presented by the computer system to a user for preview step . As shown in the user interface can display a button See Your Photobook to indicate that a photobook based on the images in the image album has been proactively created and ready for the users view. A photobook design is displayed in the user interface after the user clicks the button as shown in . The photobook can include a front cover a back cover and a plurality of pages . The book title can be automatically selected from the name of the image album . The front cover can include a book title and an image selected from the images . For example the image can be the first image in the album or the image used for a thumbnail image to represent the image album . The page can include an image . The page can include images and text . The presentation of the photobook design can include realistic illumination and texture to imitate effects of the materials in the selected book format.

The user can click arrow buttons to view different pages of the photobook. The cover and different pages of the photobook design can also be played automatically like a slide show once the user clicks the button .

Optionally the user is allowed to edit the photobook design step . The user can change switch or remove the images and on the book cover and pages . The user can also change text information such as the book cover and the text . It should be noted that the photobook design represents a complete design of a photobook that is ready to be ordered. The editing is an optional step depending on the user s time availability.

It should be understood that the proactively created photobook designs can be presented in many forms. As describe above images identified to create a photobook design typically belong to a group such as a group of shared images posted images uploaded images or images selected for printing etc. The proactively created photobook design is presented to the user at relevant places on the web pages such as on a web page for confirming the share of the group of images at a share web when the group of shared images are viewed or at a page after a group of images have been ordered for printing. The image service provider can also proactively send an email to inform someone about the creation of the photobook design. For example a user that just uploaded a group of images to the server managed by the image service provider may receive an email message from the service provider about the creation of the photobook design.

After the user has reviewed and optionally edited the photobook design the user can save the photobook design and order a physical manifestation of the photobook based on the to edit the photobook design from the image service provider step .

The image service provider can receive the order via the server has a physical manifestation manufactured at the printing facility according to the photobook design step .

Details about the proactive design of a photobook in steps are described below. Referring to a group of images having numbers within a predetermined range are first obtained as described above by a computer system step . A style and a format can be automatically selected for a photobook design step . The images are sorted by one or more criteria to produce a desirable sequence that the images will be presented in a photo book step . The criteria can include a primary criterion. For example the images can be sorted by their associated image capture times. The image capture times can be extracted from the header information in the image files. For example a JPEG image may include an EXIF header that includes the capture time of the image. It is stored by the digital camera in the image file as information in association with the image data. Referring to a cumulative image count can be plotted against image capture time. In one implementation the list of images can be sequenced chronically based on capture time of the images. Users often prefer to have images to appear in book pages in a chronological order. The images can be then separated into page groups using one or more secondary criteria. For example images can be grouped according to capture time. Images captured in a short time interval are more likely suitable to be placed on the same page facing pages or adjacent pages in a photo book. In some embodiments images that are taken in a short interval e.g. a day can be assigned to a same group e.g. Group A . The images in Group A Group B or Group C are captured in a short time interval. The images in each of these groups can be respectively grouped as candidates to appear on a same page facing pages or adjacent pages.

The sorted images may be first placed into a group including a large number of images that do not fit on a page. For example ten images in Group B are taken in a short time interval such a day. The images in Group B can be further separated into page groups using other secondary criteria such as color content and image capture locations. For instance the most popular color of each of the ten images can be plotted in a color space such as Y u v L a b etc. as shown in . The color space is first separated into finite number of regions. The most popular color is defined as the color region that has the most pixel values that fall into. The ten images can be further sub grouped according to their adjacencies in the color plane u v images may be categorized into a first group images may be categorized into a second group images may be categorized into a third group. The images in Group A might have been taken within a same day. The photographer might have traveled to several different surroundings such as a beach a restaurant indoor or a swimming pool at the hotel each of which may have different color distributions. It should be understood that the display of color content distributions of images are not limited to a specific color coordinates or the two dimensional color plane shown in . The color distributions can be plotted in three dimensional color spaces Y u v L a b or two dimensional color planes such as Y u Y v a b L a etc. In some embodiments the images with close distance in color space are intentionally separated across different pages in the photobook such as the images on a page will not look alike.

In some embodiments the images can be sorted or grouped based on geographic locations. For example assuming Group C includes five images that are taken for example in a same day. Geo location information about each of the five images can be extracted from the header information of the five images and plotted as shown in . Images are shown to have been taken in close proximity while images are taken at similar locations. Images can be sub grouped together and assigned to Page of the photo book. Images can be sub grouped together and assigned to Page of the photo book. In some embodiments the Images and the Images can be assigned to be on facing pages e.g. such as pages and such that the images from the same events can be viewed on facing pages in one open book view. In some embodiments the images with close geographic proximity are intentionally separated across different pages in the photobook such as the images on a page will not look alike. The placements of two page groups of images on facing pages can be based on one or more secondary criteria such as image capture time image color content and image capture location.

A page layout is automatically selected from the library of page layouts in accordance with the properties of the images on the page as well as the text information associated with the image receiving areas in the page layout step . The format of the image receiving field in the page layout matches the format of the selected image. For example images in Group A may include two landscape images L and two portrait images P . A notation for the image formats for Group A can be LLPP . The page layout selected from the page layout library should have four image receiving areas with matching image formats LLPP .

The page layout also includes an image caption area positioned adjacent to the image receiving area for receiving the associated text information. For example one portrait image and one landscape image may be selected for the next page. The portrait image has associated text information entered by the user and stored in conjunction with the portrait image. The landscape is not associated with any text information. In selecting a page layout the disclosed system first select page layouts containing two image receiving areas and then further selects page layouts that have include one portrait and one landscape image receiving areas. Additionally the disclosed system further selects page layouts that include an image caption area in association with the portrait image receiving area. After the page layout is selected the selected image s and associated text are automatically placed in the selected page layout step . The placement of the selected image s and associated text can be done in a single step because they are pre stored in an integrated data structure as described previously. The same steps can be repeated for fill the image fields and text fields in each page of a photo book. The user can select an image from the plurality of images to be used as part of the book cover. Details about arranging images in page layouts are disclosed in the above referenced commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 406 873 titled Smart photobook creation the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In some embodiments the design of the photobook can be dynamically changed as the identified images change in the group. For example the photobook design can dynamically change as a user adds or removes images in and out of an image album . The number of pages the number of images per page and the layout of images on the pages can automatically adapt to the changes to the images identified in the group. In general the process of updating photobook design can include the following steps similar to the descriptions above in relation to steps referring to a group of images is first identified step . If the number of images in the identified group of images is determined to be in a predetermined range step a style and a format are automatically selected for a photobook design step . A first design of a photobook is automatically created without receiving a request from a user step . The first design of the photobook is made available for the preview by a user step . When a change is detected in the group of identified images step a second design of a photobook is automatically created without receiving a request from a user in response to the change detected in the group of images step . The change in the group of images can include addition to the group of images or removal of images from the group of images. The change in the group of images can also include a change in an image property of the group of images. The image property can include a tag a keyword a title of a folder where the images are placed or metadata at least one of the images.

The second design of the photobook is subsequently presented for user s preview step . The change in the group of identified images can include addition removal a change in the sequence addition of remarks and keywords addition in change in tagging in a group of images. The uploading of images into an image folder album can take more than one uploading events. The design of the photobook can be continually updated as new images are received by the image folder album.

It should be understood that the library of page layout contains layouts with different numbers of images other than one two and three. For a given number of images on a page and for the given formats of the images the page layout is not limited to the designs shown in this application. There can be a large variation of layout designs for the same number of images with the same formats on each page. Moreover the sorting and grouping of images can be implemented by other approaches or using other metrics. The illustration of page grouping and page breaks for the images can also vary within the scope of the present disclosure. Moreover the presently disclosed systems and methods are compatible with a software application installed locally on a computer device client software in communication with a remote server or a software application installed on a central server.

In some embodiments referring to a network based image service system includes an image service center and one or more cloud storages . Examples of the image service center include Shutterfly Inc. which enables users to store organize and share images from devices via wired or wireless networks. The image service center can include one or more servers a data center and include or in communication with a product fulfillment center. The one or more server can include upload servers email servers application servers image servers and image or general purpose processors etc. A user can upload images from a device to the image service center which can be organized and stored in image albums .

The cloud storage can be established by the service provider responsible for the image service center . The cloud storage can also be provided by third party systems. The cloud storage enables users to store retrieve and share files and folders across the Internet. The files can be synchronized with a variety of user devices such as desktop or laptop computers mobile phones and tablet computer. The user devices can be run on different operating systems including Microsoft Windows Mac OS X Linux as well as versions for mobile devices such as Android IOS WebOS Windows Mobile and BlackBerry OS and a browser based client instead of a client installed on a local device.

Referring to the image service center allows its user to establish authenticated communications between the user s account at the image service center and the cloud storage step . If the user already has an account at the cloud storage the two accounts can be linked with the user s log in information and with user s authorization. If not the user can set up an account at the cloud storage that is linked to the user s account at the image service center . When the image service center and the cloud storage are enabled by the same service provider the user can also have a joint account for both systems.

The user can send and store pictures video and other files to the cloud storage from any of the devices . Communication between the devices and the cloud storage can also be conducted via an authentication API. The image files can be automatically transferred into the user s image albums in the image service center .

A unified data structure is pre defined for image albums and secondary image projects such as image product designs and photostories at the image service center step . The unified data structure is mapped from the image service center to the cloud storage step . For example a unified data structure can have a hierarchical structure including data fields for 

The images stored in the image service center can be automatically synchronized with the cloud storage step . In other words the images stored in the image service center can be sent to the cloud storage and saved in the unified data structure in the cloud storage .

The servers can enable users to create a secondary image project such as image product designs and photostories using a web or client interface in communication with the image service center or a local client installed on the devices step . The image products can be fulfilled for the users by fulfillment centers within or in connection to the image service center . Examples of image products include photobooks photo cards and stationeries photo calendars etc. Examples of the photostories can include digital scrapbooks virtual greeting cards videos produced from images a coherent presentation of photos text and design elements presented in linear or two dimensional patterns and photo slideshows. The image product designs and photo stories can include personalized text designs elements users photos and sometimes sound files.

In some embodiments the secondary image project such as the image product designs and the photostories can be proactively or automatically created by image applications run on the severs in the image service center or by client applications run on user devices without being requested by a user step . For example a group of images can be automatically identified by the severs and used to create a photobook or a photo calendar by the severs in the image service center . Furthermore images stored in the same or across different albums can be analyzed and identified by the severs . Images sharing a common theme can be automatically selected by the severs to form a photo story. The photostories and the image product designs include images as well as design components such as text image borders image edit properties e.g. cropping color enhancement image border red eye removal image rotation image background embellishment . . . . Examples of the image products include photobooks greeting cards photo calendars stationeries photo gifts. The metadata tags and keywords can include descriptors occasions events image capture times image upload times image capture locations image edit properties image captions and image borders. Details of computer assisted or automated creation of image products or image projects without user request are described above in relation to .

When an image product or a photostory is created on a device e.g. or at a web user interface to the image service center the created secondary image project is stored at the image service center step . The created secondary image project is automatically sent to step and stored step at the cloud storage .

An advantage of the disclosed system is that they can significantly save users time spent on transferring saving or organizing images from multiple devices. The disclosed systems and methods allow image projects and image product designs created on a device or at an image service center to be automatically stored at cloud storage and made accessible to other devices that are connected or not connected to the image service center. The accesses to a group of or individual images image product designs and photostories by different users can be flexibly defined by the owner of the data.

Another advantage of the disclosed system is that the creation users devices or image service center of the secondary image project and the storage and sharing e.g. cloud storage of the secondary image project can be performed by different systems which can minimize cost of data traffic over the network and allow each system to be optimized for it individual functions. It should be noted that the image product or the photostory can be automatically created by the server in the image service center can be automatically stored and accessed at the cloud storage . In other words the data synchronization between the image service center and the cloud storage are not limited to user data uploaded to the image service center or the cloud storage . Secondary image projects such as image product designs and photostories are also automatically synchronized with the cloud storage in the pre defined unified data structure.

A user can use a client a web interface in communication with the image service center or a cloud dashboard to manage and edit images photostories and image product designs stored at the cloud storage which is automatically synchronized with the user s image albums image product designs and photostories in image service center . The cloud dashboard can be connected to the cloud storage via a web socket. The user can also authorize his or her friends and family members to view and to contribute to the user s images photostories and image product designs at the cloud storage and at the image service center step . For example the user can assign other users roles such as viewer contributor commenter editor etc. Moreover different images photostories videos files or different folders can be defined to be accessed by different members.

Referring to an exemplified user interface in communication with the image service center or the cloud dashboard includes a control panel that the owner Raymond can use to define other users roles step in accessing Raymond data stored in the cloud storage and the image service center . Raymond has the highest access level as manager editor contributor commenter and viewer. Raymond s wife is assigned as an editor contributor commenter and viewer. Grandparents and a sibling may be assigned the roles of contributor commenter and viewer. A relative e.g. a cousin may have the role of commenter and viewer. A friend may be only a viewer. In general users having higher level roles also have access rights of the lower level roles. The control panel can for example include a plurality of selectable controls such as selection buttons which allow the owner Raymond to easily define roles for different users. The levels of user accesses can be defined for each image album folders of product designs or photostories in the cloud storage for the application of the image service center .

The levels of user accesses can also be based on individual images product designs or photostories. In some embodiments the levels of user accesses are defined by tags associated with the images image product designs or photostories. The secondary image project such as image project and photostories will be accessible on other devices step . The user can view edit share or order the image products or photostories using different devices . The images or photostories or image products in the image service center and the cloud storage are labeled with time stamp for proper version control.

The disclosed systems and methods can include one or more of the following advantages The disclosed systems and methods can significantly save users time spent on transferring saving or organizing images from multiple devices. The disclosed systems and methods allow photostories and image product created on one device to be automatically stored at cloud storage and made accessible to other devices. Moreover the accesses to a group of or individual images photostories and image products by different users can be flexibly defined by the owner of the data.
