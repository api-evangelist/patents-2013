title: Real estate blueprint and panoramic video visualization
abstract: The subject matter is suitable for facilitating conversion of standard architectural blueprints/maps and panoramic photos, both being directed to a property, and creating an interactive top down viewable map of the blueprint superimposed over an image comprised of the panoramic photos merged together to form a unified perspective. The subject matter uses the processed blueprints to generate a grid template of capture points for panoramic high definition video, images, and audio. Each capture point captures a ground-up and a ceiling-down capture and some captures in between both facing up and down.

The application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61 617 561 filed Mar. 29 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Home buyers renters and speculators have to make decisions on which homes for sale or rent to view in person and consider because there are many homes listed and there is not enough time to see them all. Sometimes buyers have to buy or rent sight unseen based only on pictures attached to an internet listing. In order to make more informed decisions of which properties to consider it is desirable that the buyer has more information.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Various embodiments discuss a process that converts standard architectural blueprints maps and panoramic photos both for the same body of real estate and creates an interactive top down viewable map of the blueprint superimposed over an image comprised of the panoramic photos merged together to form a unified perspective both blueprint and image in the same scale so as to make the blueprint match the dimensions depicted the spatial features in the merged image.

This system takes a blueprint for a property at a specific address digitizes it processes it and makes it viewable as a standard web map viewer makes maps viewable on the internet or native operating system application. The system uses an application which takes uploaded digitized images of the blueprints and processes them. The app uses the processed blueprints to generate a grid template of capture points for panoramic high definition video and images and audio.

These capture points are translated into code or human readable instructions with measurements from X Y of the grid. A human or an application that controls a camera captures the aforementioned media at each capture point and the media is stored locally or uploaded and stored on the application server. Each capture point includes a ground up and a ceiling down capture and some captures in between both facing up and down. Specifically half spheres that use the maximum distance for capturing high definition video as the diameter less a buffer distance are overlapped so as to create half cubes that when arranged side to side contain no out of focus resolution image data. The capture point grid is created by taking the square area of a room or the property and dividing by the square area figure that is derived from one side of a cube that fits inside without breach a sphere that has a radius of the maximum distance of high def capture. Beyond the distance the capture would not be high definition. 

The panoramic video images and accompanying audio is processed to resemble a unbroken patchwork of ceiling down images at a certain height from the ground floor and overlaid or underlaid to scale on the blueprint as a layer. This layer is viewable in the same manner as a standard web map and moves together with the blueprint layer and other layers. There is also a floor up images layer the camera was on the floor capturing upwards. This layer is viewable in the same manner as a standard web map and moves together with the blueprint layer and other layers.

In order to facilitate correct positioning of camera on capture point beacons which communicate distance from themselves to the camera can be placed in each corner of the room or property. Beacons are devices that communicate in real time the distance from a communication enabled camera or a device physically attached to a camera. Alternatively beacons can also be placed on the corners of the property.

The map style viewer of these produced layers contains a play button to play the patchwork of images as if they were a video and cued up with audio sound captured at the time of the recording. The view has a progress bar which represents a timeline from the start of the capture to the end of the capture. Alternately the viewer can show just one time of day a close range of captures .

A layer with a moon icon and or a sun icon will be placed over the display to indicate the position of the sun and give context to where natural light originated in the state of the image. Center of image would be directly overhead and a circle surrounding or placed on the image would represent the horizon. The view will display all the layers in any combination of superimposition. For example given a room is 20 tall and the maximum distance to capture high def for a camera is 10 at the minimum two layers would be created for ceiling down panoramic overlapping images and two layers would be created for floor up panoramic overlapping images. When real estate at a specific address is processed through this system the user will be able to access and interact with the viewer in a web browser.

While illustrative embodiments have been illustrated and described it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
