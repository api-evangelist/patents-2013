This application claims the benefit of provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 684 207 filed 2012 Aug. 17 by the present inventor

Indoor or gym climbing on artificial structures has evolved from the traditional outdoor sport of rock climbing where climbers ascend natural boulders and rock faces. The significant increase in the number of climbing gyms is largely attributed to their convenience safety and proximity to residential areas.

The walls at indoor climbing gyms are usually built from prefabricated fake rock panels or textured plywood sheets that have regularly spaced holes and are attached to a metal or wood framework inside the gym. The walls are attached to the building s structure at both the base and the top so that they are stable and don t move or flex. While most gym walls are vertical some walls have horizontal overhangs or sections that are other than 90 from the floor. Indoor climbing walls range in height from 10 to 50 feet.

Climbing holds are made of resin poured into molds of varying shapes and sizes from tiny edges to giant hand sized buckets. The holds are bolted onto the wall s threaded holes using cap end hex bolts to provide support and or a gripping place for the climber to ascend or traverse the wall.

With the holds attached to the wall climbing gyms often hire designers to select a subset of the holds and collectively define this group as a route . Routes are assigned a degree of difficulty from a scale of commonly understood and agreed upon subjective ratings. Climbers use route ratings to gauge their progress and compete against other climbers.

To designate a route climbing gyms will use homogeneously colored holds distinctly colored tape or chalk marks. However each of these methods has its drawbacks buying same color holds for each route is prohibitively expensive inflexible and does not allow for overlapping routes tape tends to peel off and chalk is easily erased when climbers rub against the marks. Furthermore each of these methods are static and require human interaction to set or alter a route s pattern.

Another issue with tradition indoor climbing routes is that when compared to other leisure activities they can be boring. Without an interactive component or game mechanic climbers often tire of climbing plastic . This problem is multiplied on home climbing walls that offer fewer routes for the climber to use. Moreover the lack of interactivity does not allow the climber to improve their technique by providing feedback on their climbing.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 732 954 entitled Route Recording Marking and Scoring Apparatus for Sport Climbing Walls issued Mar. 31 1998 to Strickler et al. teaches a system to record and identify routes created on artificial climbing structures. However light source of 954 patent is completely separated and independent from the climbing holds and requires significant alteration of the climbing wall to install the system.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 732 954 A discloses a climbing wall comprising holds which detect the weight of a climber. Signals from weighted holds are transmitted to a computer which stores the route chosen by the climber. Electronically activated markers positioned adjacent to each hold then indicate the holds comprising this specific route. A new climber can try to follow this specific route by using indicated holds but if the new climber uses an illegal hold which is not indicated and thus is not included in the route this is registered by the computer. However this system requires specially designed holds and a customized nonstandard climbing wall.

U.S. Pat. Application 2008 0032863 discloses a climbing wall system comprising a climbing wall provided with several holds each connected to a respective sensor which is arranged to detect the presence of a foot or a hand on the hold where said system comprises a sound system arranged to play music and a control device arranged to receive signals of the sensors and control the sound system to play a certain musical fragment when a particular hold is touched. While this system does provide an interactive indoor climbing component it also requires gyms to purchase specialized climbing holds.

Applicant submits that there is no system found in the marketplace that allows climbing gyms to use their existing holds and climbing walls to create an interactive environment where climbing holds both illuminate sense the climber s presence and enable the climber to participate in climber selectable activities. There is a need in the climbing art to provide an assembly and process to create planned climbing routes for indoor and outdoor climbing wall structures to keep climbers interested and challenged.

Whereas there is a long felt and as yet unfulfilled need for a solution that enables climbing gyms to leverage their infrastructure investment with a system that uses existing climbing holds and climbing walls to create an interactive environment featuring climbing hold illumination and the ability to detect a climber s presence on a hold 

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus that uses the bolt that affixes a climbing hold to the wall as a mechanism to illuminate the hold.

Beyond using the bolt as a mechanism to illuminate the hold it is a further object of the invention to provide an apparatus to detect a climber s presence on a hold through its mounting bolt.

It is a further object to provide an apparatus for recreational climbing that allows climbing routes to be selected and displayed on a climbing wall. The present invention with its self illumination property can help climbers to identify their next hold in the route the past route taken a friend s route etc.

It is a further object to provide an apparatus for competitive climbing that computes displays and stores a record of a climber s performance on a route.

It is a further object to provide an apparatus that increases the enjoyment of gym climbing through interactive exercises and games.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.
