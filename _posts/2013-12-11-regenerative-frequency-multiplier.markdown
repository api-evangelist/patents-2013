A frequency synthesizer may perform frequency multiplication frequency division and or frequency mixing in order to generate an output signal with a frequency that is related to a frequency of the input signal F . A frequency multiplier may generate an output signal that is a harmonic i.e. multiple of the input signal. For example the output signal at the frequency multiplier may have a frequency of 2F. A frequency divider may generate an output frequency that is a fraction of the input signal e.g. the output signal may have a frequency of F n wherein n is an integer . A frequency mixer may mix two signals in order to calculate sum and difference frequency components of the two signals. Frequency multipliers frequency dividers and or frequency mixers may be included in numerous electronic systems in which input frequencies are transformed to output frequencies such as in radio receivers global position system GPS devices radar systems electronic warfare EW systems mobile telephones satellite receivers etc.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

As used herein the term substantially refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action characteristic property state structure item or result. For example an object that is substantially enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of substantially is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action characteristic property state structure item or result.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Regenerative frequency dividers as known may be included in frequency synthesizers and or phase locked loops PLLs in order to generate an output signal with a frequency that is related to a frequency of an input signal. A regenerative frequency divider may be implemented in both analog and digital applications. For example regenerative frequency dividers may be used for improving the performance of electronic countermeasures equipment communications systems and laboratory instruments. In addition regenerative frequency dividers may be key components in radio frequency RF and microwave systems. Furthermore regenerative frequency dividers may be included in radar systems electronic warfare EW systems communication systems etc.

In general a regenerative frequency divider as known is a low noise non linear analog feedback circuit. In one example the regenerative frequency divider may include at least a frequency mixer an amplifier and a filter e.g. a low pass filter or a band pass filter . The regenerative frequency divider may receive an input signal having a frequency of F. The input signal may travel through the feedback circuit a plurality of times and a stable output signal having a frequency of

The closed loop feedback nature of the regenerative frequency divider circuit can limit the output signals of the circuit to

Furthermore known combinations of frequency dividers and frequency multipliers may be used to generate the non integer frequency multiples e.g. or 4 3 of the input signal. For example in order to generate an output signal with a frequency of 320 megahertz MHz from an input signal with a frequency of 240 MHz i.e. a factor of 4 3 a series of times two 2 divide by three 3 and times two 2 mathematical operations may be performed on the input signal. In other words the 240 MHz may be multiplied by 2 divided by 3 and then multiplied by 2 in order to generate the 320 MHz. However using the combination of frequency dividers and multipliers may employ a significant amount of RF circuitry and produce more noise when compared to the analog feedback circuit of the regenerative frequency divider which generates stable output signals of

Disclosed herein is a novrel regenerative frequency multiplier. As discussed in greater detail below and unlike known devices and or systems the regenerative frequency multiplier may generate one or more output signals with frequencies that are non integer frequency multiples of the input signal. The regenerative frequency multiplier is a low noise non linear analog feedback circuit. The regenerative frequency multiplier may include a frequency multiplication stage which creates a regenerative multiple function within the regenerative frequency multiplier. In particular the multiplication stage may be a frequency multiplier. The frequency multiplier can multiply an input signal by N wherein N is a predefined integer. The signal produced at the frequency multiplier may be continuously regenerated inside the closed loop of the feedback circuit. In one example the frequency transfer function of the regenerative frequency multiplier may be

An input signal having a defined frequency of F e.g. 1000 MHz may be received at the regenerative frequency multiplier . The input signal may pass through an attenuator which reduces a power level associated with the input signal . In other words the attenuator may provide a loss or a gain of less than one . The input signal may be split into two separate signals at the splitter . Thus a first signal with the defined frequency of the input signal may be received at a coupler and a second signal with the defined frequency of the input signal may be received at a frequency mixer . In other words the first signal and the second signal may have the same frequency as the input signal e.g. 1000 MHz . In general the two signals that are outputted at the splitter may each have the same frequency as the signal that is inputted into the splitter.

The first signal from the splitter may pass through the coupler and a phase shifter . When the input signal is initially inputted into the regenerative frequency multiplier i.e. when time T 0 the coupler may only receive the signal from the splitter . As discussed in greater detail below when T 0 then the coupler may receive an additional signal from an attenuator . The phase shifter may shift a phase of the first signal by a defined number of degrees such as 90 degrees. The phase shifter may not affect the frequency of the first signal. For example a 1000 MHz signal that enters the phase shifter may remain a 1000 MHz signal when exiting the phase shifter . Thus the frequency of the first may be Fwhen exiting the phase shifter .

The first signal may be received at a frequency multiplier . When T 0 the frequency multiplier may be turned on upon receiving the first signal. The frequency multiplier may multiply the first signal having the frequency of F by N wherein N is a predefined integer. As explained in greater detail below the value of N e.g. 2 3 or 4 may be selected based on a desired output signal or . The frequency multiplier may contain a plurality of blocks such as a block with an 2 multiplier a block with an 3 multiplier a block with an 4 multiplier and a switch may select an appropriate block based on the value of N. In the example when N 2 the frequency multiplier may produce a first signal having a frequency of 2F.

A band pass filter may receive the first signal from the frequency multiplier e.g. the first signal having the frequency of 2F . The band pass filter may be configured to limit signals that can pass through the band pass filter to a predetermined frequency. The predetermined frequency may depend on the value of N. In one example the band pass filter may set the frequency of signals that can pass through the band pass filter to

In the example when N 2 the band pass filter may receive the first signal having the frequency of 2F but limit the first signal to a frequency of

The frequency mixer may contain three ports a local oscillator L port a radio frequency R port and an intermediate frequency I port. The L and R ports are input signal ports and the I port is an output signal port. The frequency mixer may mix the first and second signals received at the R and L ports respectively and generate two mixed signals. In other words each mixed signal may be produced from the first and second signals. The frequency mixer may perform a plus minus function with the first and second signals received at the R and L ports. Therefore the two mixed signals may have a frequency that is either the sum or difference frequency of the first and second signals received at the R and L ports respectively. In other words F F F wherein Fis the frequency of the signal at the I port Fis the frequency of the signal at the L port and Fis the frequency of the signal at the R port.

In one example the band pass filter may be configured to limit the mixed signals that can pass through the band pass filter . In one example the band pass filter may allow only the mixed signal having the frequency of

In the example when N 2 the splitter may split the mixed signals coming from the I port of the frequency mixer such that the two mixed signals having frequencies of

The frequency mixer may mix the first signal having the frequency of Fthat is received at the L port and the

In one example the splitter may split the at least two mixed signals that are received from the frequency mixer . The filter may allow a first desired signal from the at least two mixed signals received from the splitter to pass through the filter wherein the first output signal is generated from the first desired signal. The filter may allow a second desired signal from the at least two mixed signals received from the splitter to pass through the filter . The amplifier may amplify the second desired signal. The splitter may split the second desired signal so that a first portion of the second desired signal is used to produce the second output signal and a second portion of the second desired signal is fed back into the frequency mixer .

In one example the coupler may provide the second portion of the second desired signal and the first signal received from the splitter to the frequency multiplier . In addition the first output signal may have a frequency of
