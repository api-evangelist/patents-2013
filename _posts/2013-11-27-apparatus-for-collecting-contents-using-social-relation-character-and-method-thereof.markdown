Hereinafter embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.

The SNS server is a hardware device and or a software program and is configured to provide social network service to the client or other systems. The social network service allows various kinds of contents uploaded to the SNS server by service users to be stored shared and displayed for other service users.

The SNS server may be associated with the client to provide social meta data and recommended contents to the client . In addition there may be provided one or more SNS server associated with the computer system according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The SNS server may be one of an on line community server a SNS service server and a blog service server. For example the SNS server may include a server such as FACEBOOK CYWORLD GOOGLE DAUM NAVER FLICKR TWITER LINKNOW WEEBLY TODOLY RAINMAKER SEESMIC SLIDEROCKET LINKEDIN PINTEREST or the like. In addition in an embodiment the SNS server may be a web page such as homepages of registered friends timeline or wall of FACEBOOK or the like.

Moreover in an embodiment of the present disclosure the content may be a multimedia content including at least one of an image a moving picture music a text and so on.

The network allows communication between the SNS server and the client . In an embodiment the network uses standard communication techniques protocols. Therefore the network may include links using techniques such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 2G 3G 4G digital subscriber line DSL asynchronous transfer mode ATM infiniband PCI Express Advanced Switching or the like. Similarly the networking protocol used on the network includes multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP user datagram protocol UDP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP file transfer protocol FTP or the like. Data exchanged on the network may be expressed using techniques and or formats including image data in a binary form for example portable network graphics PNG hypertext markup language HTML extensible markup language XML or the like. Additionally the links may be entirely or partially encrypted using an existing encryption technique such as secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS virtual private networks VPNs Internet Protocol security IPsec or the like.

The client is a computer system and the client may be a smart phone a desktop a laptop a digital camera a wearable digital device a personal digital assistant PDA or a table PC. Hereinafter the client will be referred to as an apparatus for collecting contents using social relation characters.

The input unit may receive search information from a single participant or a main user included in a collaborative group. Here the collaborative group is composed of a plurality of participants. The input unit may receive a user input through a device such as a keyboard a mouse a touch screen a track ball or the like. In other case data may be transmitted or received through the network of the apparatus with a user terminal a SNS server and other web servers and the search information may also be received from another communication device.

The search information is a search work input by the main user and may be a combination of one or more words. For example an image name for example 20130808.jpg or the like weather location and name of a tagged person name of another participant or the like may be input as the search information.

The plurality of participants mentioned above means a collaborative group including the participant who transmits search information to the content collecting apparatus . In other words the plurality of participants included in the collaborative group may be identified based on each user information stored in the database . The user information includes ID nickname or the like and a participant included in the collaborative group may be selected by means of subscription to the collaborative group or by a manager. Hereinafter among participants included in the collaborative group a person who performs searching is called a main user and the other participants are called related users. In addition users other than the main user and the related users are called other users.

In an embodiment a person who inputs search information to collect contents among event participants is a main user persons other than the main user among event participants are related users and other users may be friends or followers of the event participants on SNS who do not participant in the event.

The database may store a social network service SNS subscriber list of the main user and related users in relation to the main user and group information in relation to friendship in an SNS. In other words the database stores a list of SNS in which each of the plurality of participants participates and also stores friendship information of each participant in each SNS. This is because the plurality of participants may not use the same SNS or may not be registered as friends in each SNS.

The content managing unit may search contents in relation to the received search information from contents possessed by the main user and the related users in the SNS server by using the group information and define the searched contents as a first content group. In addition with respect to the content included in the first content group the content managing unit may calculate a first interest index based on additional information input by the related user and determine a predetermined content on which interest of the related users is focused based on the calculated first interest index.

The predetermined content on which interest of the related users is focused means only contents for which the related users have high interest degrees selected from contents corresponding to the search information.

In detail the content managing unit may search the search information query received by the input unit at the SNS server. The content managing unit may search contents corresponding to the search information from all data present in the SNS server but may also search contents corresponding to the search information from contents possessed by the main user and the related users in the SNS server. For this the content managing unit may determine a search range by checking the related users associated as SNS friends of the main user by using the group information stored in the DB .

In addition in an embodiment there may be provided a plurality of SNS servers. In addition there may present various SNS servers or service to which the main user does not subscribe or only a part of the related users subscribes and thus the content managing unit may include all contents possessed by the main user and the related users in the SNS server in the search range based on the SNS server and friendship included in the group information.

By doing so contents corresponding to the search information input by the main user may be searched from contents possessed by the main user and the related users in the SNS server. In the above the expression possess means a state in which a user uploads content such as an image a text or a moving picture to the SNS server or shares the content uploaded by another person so that the content is directly or indirectly associated with the user. For example this means a state in which a picture uploaded by a user or a posting in a wall uploaded by another person is shared or re tweeted.

The content managing unit may calculate a first interest index for each of the searched contents based on additional information input by the related users. In other case the content managing unit may also calculate the first interest index based on additional information input by the main user and the related users. Here the additional information includes at least one of comment information sharing information and likability information. In other words the additional information shows a trace of feelings of SNS users with respect to contents present in the SNS server. Generally the additional information may be a comment and depending on the kind of SNS the uploaded content may include the number of sharing by other users sharer information likability information or the like.

The content managing unit calculates the first interest index by using the additional information input by the related users. Therefore the first interest index may be an index for determining interest degrees of the related users with respect to the content. Here the related users may include the main user.

In an embodiment the content managing unit may calculate the first interest index by using Equation 1 or 2 below but the method for calculating the first interest index is not limited thereto but may be applied in various ways depending on a user participation inducing manner provided by SNS or collected information. the first interest index the number of comments of the related users the number of related users the number of related users who have made comments Equation 1 the first interest index the number of related users the number of comments of the related users Equation 2

The content managing unit may determine a predetermined content on which interest of the related users is focused based on the first interest index calculated as above. For example if there are too many contents only contents whose first interest indexes are calculated as being over a certain level may be determined as predetermined contents on which interest of the related users is focused.

The first sub content managing unit may extract a keyword by analyzing comments in relation to the predetermined content on which interest of the related users is focused. The first sub content managing unit may extract a keyword based on a natural language process. For example the first sub content managing unit may extract a word or sentence most frequently mentioned in relation to the content.

After that the first sub content managing unit may search content in relation to the extracted keyword from contents possessed by the main user and the related users in the SNS server and define the searched content as a second content group. Here if the content included in the second content group is also included in the first content group the corresponding content may be excluded from the second content group.

For example if the main user inputs 2013 August France Paris as search information and searches contents of the first content group comments about all searched contents or about predetermined contents on which interest of the related users is focused is may be analyzed to extract a keyword France Paris or France . In this case the first sub content managing unit may use France Paris as search information and search content from contents possessed by the main user and the related users. Accordingly contents in relation to France Paris may be searched.

As a result even though the main user searches only contents in relation to 2013 August France Paris other contents the second content group may also be searched in addition to the searched content the first content group based on comments about contents for which the related users have high interest degrees among the searched contents. For example the main user may be provided with contents in the second content group in relation to France Paris in relation to the period before 2013.

As described above the first sub content managing unit may extract a plurality of keywords. In addition the first sub content managing unit may search contents with respect to each of the extracted keywords individually. In other case the first sub content managing unit may search contents with respect to the plurality of extracted keywords simultaneously. In other words in the above case the first sub content managing unit may search contents separately for France and Paris or search contents including both France and Paris .

In another embodiment the content managing unit may include second sub content managing unit which calculates a second interest index based on additional information input by other users than the main user and the related users with respect to each of the searched contents and determines a predetermined content on which interest of other users is focused based on the calculated second interest index.

The second interest index is calculated based on additional information provided in relation to the content by other users who have no relation with the main user and the related users. For example if the main user and the related users make the same trip and are set as a group in the group information other users means users not included in the group information.

Therefore the second sub content managing unit may calculate the second interest index according to interest degrees of other users from the searched contents and determine at least a part of the searched contents as a predetermined content on which interest of other users is focused based on the calculation result.

In an embodiment the second sub content managing unit may calculate the second interest index by using Equation 3 below. the second interest index 0.5 the number of likability the number of other users who have made comments 2 the number of sharing Equation 3

In addition in another embodiment the second sub content managing unit may extract a keyword from comments input by the other users from comments about a predetermined content on which interest of other users is focused search a content in relation to the searched keyword at a web server other than the SNS server and define the searched content as a third content group.

Here the web server may include GOOGLE NAVER BAIDU YAHOO or a certain SNS server to which no one is registered among the plurality of participants without being limited thereto. In addition the content of the third content group may be an image and in this case the second sub content managing unit may search content in relation to the predetermined content on which interest of other users is focused from the web server by using a relevant image searching algorithm or a relevant new searching method. In addition the content of the third content group includes a news article a blog posting an image a text or the like without being limited thereto.

In an embodiment the apparatus for collecting contents using social relation characters may include a display unit for displaying the contents of the first second and third content groups to be independently arranged in a display area.

The display unit is a display device using PDP LCD LED or OLED and the display unit may include a touch screen and operate integrally with the input unit.

In an embodiment the display unit may arrange the contents of the first second and third content groups in the display area independently so that the contents of each group are arranged in an ascending order of the first interest index or the second interest index by using the first interest index or the second interest index. Referring to two contents are displayed in the first content group for example and a content having a higher first interest index may be disposed higher based on the first interest index.

In addition the content described in the specification may be configured to include at least one image or a text may be included therein the number of likability marks or the number of sharing and comments as shown in . In addition the third content group may include at least one image or article news article or blog posting .

The SNS server may include an API unit a user information DB and a content DB . The API unit may process information stored in the DB of the SNS server . In addition the user information DB stores user information of users who subscribe to the SNS server and the user information include user ID email and friendship information among users. In addition the content DB includes contents uploaded by users of the SNS server .

The users of the SNS server are subscribers registered to the service provided by the SNS server . The uploaded content includes an image a moving picture and a text and also includes comments sharing likability mark or the like added to the image the moving picture and the text.

In an embodiment the content managing unit may communicate with the SNS server by using a communication interface not shown and search and collect necessary information by accessing the DB in the SNS server by using the API unit .

In detail the content managing unit searches and collects contents in relation to the search information from the DB in the SNS server . The content managing unit may identify which user is related to the searched content by referring to the user information DB . In addition if the identified user of the content is a member of the collaborative group the content managing unit collects the contents and classifies into the first content group. Therefore a user may identify content in relation to a participant of the collaborative group to which the user belongs from the searched contents.

The description of may be supplemented with reference to the above description in relation to the apparatus for collecting contents using social relation characters.

If the main user inputs search information the SNS server searches contents corresponding to the input search information. Here the search range is not set to cover all contents included in the SNS server but set to cover only contents possessed by the main user and the related users who are registered as friends and have predetermined relations designated as a group .

The searched contents may be defined as a first content group. In addition with respect to the contents included in the first content group a first interest index may be calculated to determined predetermined contents on which interest of the related users is focused. In addition a second interest index may be calculated to define at least a part of the contents as predetermined contents on which interest of other users is focused. The contents may be arranged in different orders depending on the size of the first interest index or the second interest index.

Comments about contents included in the predetermined contents on which interest of the related users is focused are analyzed to extract keywords searching is performed at the SNS server based on the extracted keywords to collect contents and the collected contents are defined as the second content group .

Comments about the predetermined comments on which interest of other users is focused may be analyzed to extract a keyword or an image . In addition relevant contents may be searched from the web server based on the extract keyword or image . Here the predetermined comments on which interest of other users is focused may be a SNS posting including an image or a text. Based on the extracted keyword or image relevant contents may be searched at the web server by using a relevant image searching algorithm or a relevant new searching method. The contents searched at the web server as described above may be a blog posting an image or a text and such contents are defined as a third content group .

In addition the method for collecting contents using social relation characters may further include extracting a keyword from comments input by the related users among comments about the predetermined content on which interest of the related users is focused searching a content in relation to the extracted keyword from contents possessed by the main user and the related users in the SNS server and defining the searched content as a second content group.

In another embodiment the method for collecting contents using social relation characters may further include calculating a second interest index based on additional information input by other users than the main user and the related users with respect to each of the searched contents the contents of the first content group and determining a predetermined content on which interest of other users is focused based on the calculated second interest index.

In another embodiment the method for collecting contents using social relation characters may further include extracting a keyword from comments input by the other users from comments about the predetermined content on which interest of other users is focused searching a content in relation to the searched keyword at a web server other than the SNS server and defining the searched content as a third content group. Further the method for collecting contents using social relation characters may also further include displaying the contents of the first second and third content groups to be independently arranged in a display area.
