The present invention relates to polypropylene based resin expanded beads and to a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article. More particularly the present invention is directed to polypropylene based resin expanded beads that can give a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article having electrostatic dissipating properties and to a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article obtained by in mold molding of the expanded beads.

Polypropylene based resins are well balanced in terms of mechanical strength and heat resistance. Molded articles produced by in mold molding of expanded beads constituted of such a polypropylene based resin as a base resin not only have excellent properties inherent in the polypropylene based resin but also are excellent in shock absorbing properties and in recovery from compressive strain and are therefore used in a wide variety of applications including packaging materials for electric and electronic components and shock absorbing materials for automobiles.

However because polypropylene based resins are materials with a high electrical resistance foamed molded articles constituted of a polypropylene based resin as a base resin tend to be electrically charged. Thus expanded beads molded articles to which antistatic performance or conductive performance has been imparted are used as the packaging materials for electronic components and so on which must be kept away from static electricity Patent Documents 1 6 .

In recent years the improvement in performance of electronic components such as integrated circuits and hard disks has created a demand for an electrostatically dissipative material having a surface resistivity of 1 10to 1 10 to prevent the electronic components from being damaged by static electricity. However a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article having a surface resistivity of 1 10to 1 10 has not been able to be produced stably by a conventional antistatic or conductivity imparting treatment technology.

For example as methods for imparting antistatic performance to a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article there are proposed a method in which antistatic expanded beads obtained by foaming and expanding resin particles containing a surfactant are in mold molded to obtain an expanded beads molded article as disclosed in Patent Document 1 and a method in which expanded beads obtained by foaming and expanding resin particles covered with a resin layer containing a polymeric antistatic agent are in mold molded to obtain an expanded beads molded article as disclosed in Patent Document 2 .

These methods are effective in producing an expanded beads molded article having antistatic performance. With a method in which an antistatic agent as described above is compounded in a polypropylene based resin however it is difficult to achieve a surface resistivity of not higher than 1 10 using a suitable amount of the antistatic agent because there is a limitation in the electrical characteristics of the antistatic agent itself. When a large amount of the antistatic agent is added for the purpose of achieving a surface resistivity of not higher than 1 10 the resulting expanded beads show considerably poor expansion property and fusion bonding property at the time of molding.

As a method for imparting electrical conductivity to a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article a method is known in which an electrically conductive inorganic substance such as an electrically conductive carbon black or metal powder is added to the base resin of the expanded beads to create in the base resin an electrically conductive network of the electrically conductive inorganic substance as disclosed in for example Patent Documents 3 to 5. There is also a method in which as disclosed in Patent Document 6 electrically conductive expanded beads obtained by foaming and expanding resin particles each covered with an electrically conductive carbon black containing resin layer are in mold molded to obtain an expanded beads molded article. With these method polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded articles having a surface resistivity of lower than 1 10 can be produced with ease.

In order to obtain an expanded beads molded article having a surface resistivity of 1 10to 1 10 by a method using an electrically conductive inorganic substance it is thought effective to reduce the content of the electrically conductive inorganic substance. However a so called percolation phenomenon in which the surface resistivity shows a sharp discontinuous change occurs when the content of electrically conductive inorganic substance is reduced to a certain level percolation threshold . It is therefore difficult to achieve a surface resistivity in the range of 1 10to 1 10 in a stable manner.

In particular conventional polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded articles that contain an electrically conductive inorganic substance have a problem that a drastic discontinuous change occurs in their surface resistivity in a region close to the percolation threshold. One possible reason for this is the fact that at least two expansion steps expansion of resin particles into expanded beads and secondary expansion of the expanded beads during in mold molding must be carried out to obtain an expanded beads molded article. Namely the surface resistivity is greatly influenced by the distance between electrically conductive carbon black particles but it is difficult to control the distance between the electrically conductive carbon black particles contained in the polypropylene based resin during the expansion that takes place in the two expansion steps. Thus it is considered that because the surface resistivity varies with a change in distance between the electrically conductive carbon black particles it is very difficult to stably achieve a surface resistivity of 1 10to 1 10 .

The above methods have another problem because even a slight difference in dispersion state of the electrically conductive inorganic substance results in a significant variation in the surface resistivity of the expanded beads molded article. Thus even when the expanded beads molded article has a desired performance as a whole some portions of the molded article may have a surface resistivity outside the desired range.

It is therefore an objective problem of the present invention to provide polypropylene based resin expanded beads that excel in expansion property and fusion bonding property during molding and that are capable of giving a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article which can stably exhibit electrostatic dissipating properties of a surface resistivity range of 1 10to 1 10 while maintaining excellent properties inherent in the polypropylene based resin and to provide a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article obtained by in mold molding of such expanded beads.

In accordance with the present invention there are provided polypropylene based resin expanded beads and a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article as follows 

 1 An electrostatic dissipative polypropylene based resin expanded bead comprising an expanded core layer comprising a polypropylene based resin and

a cover layer that covers the expanded core layer and that comprises a mixed resin containing electrically conductive carbon black 

wherein the mixed resin comprises a polypropylene resin which forms a continuous phase and a polyethylene resin which forms dispersed phases dispersed in the continuous phase 

the electrically conductive carbon black is unevenly distributed to the dispersed phases side and present in an amount of 5 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the polypropylene resin and the polyethylene resin 

the polypropylene resin and the polyethylene resin are present in such a proportion as to provide a weight ratio of the polypropylene resin to the polyethylene resin is 99.5 0.5 to 50 50 and the expanded bead has an apparent density of 10 to 120 kg m 

 2 The polypropylene based resin expanded bead according to above 1 wherein the cover layer has an average thickness of 0.2 m or more 

 3 The polypropylene based resin expanded bead according to above 1 or 2 wherein the electrically conductive carbon black is Ketjen black and present in an amount of 5 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the polypropylene resin and the polyethylene resin and 4 A molded article comprising the expanded beads according to any one of above 1 to 3 which are integrally fusion bonded together said molded article having a surface resistivity of 1 10to 1 10 . 5 A process for producing electrostatic dissipative polypropylene based resin expanded beads having an apparent density of 10 to 120 kg m3 and each comprising an expanded core layer comprising a polypropylene based resin and a cover layer that covers the expanded core layer and that comprises a mixed resin containing electrically conductive carbon black said process comprising the steps of 

feeding a molten resin obtained by melting and kneading a polypropylene based resin for forming a core layer of resin particles into a coextrusion die together with a molten resin obtained by melting and kneading a polypropylene resin a polyethylene resin and electrically conductive carbon black for forming a cover layer of the resin particles to form a molten resin composition that has a core sheath structure in which the molten resin for forming a cover layer of the resin particles is laminated to surround a linear flow of the molten resin for forming a core layer of resin particles extruding the molten resin composition through small holes cutting the extruded molten resin composition to obtain composite resin particles in which the polypropylene based resin core layer is covered with the electrically conductive carbon black containing mixed resin cover layer and

impregnating the composite resin particles with a blowing agent and expanding and foaming the composite resin particles 

wherein a mixing proportion of the polypropylene resin and the polyethylene resin in terms of weight ratio of the polypropylene resin to the polyethylene resin is 99.5 0.5 to 50 50 and a mixing proportion of the carbon black is 5 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the polypropylene resin and the polyethylene resin.

The electrostatic dissipative polypropylene based resin expanded bead s hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as expanded bead s according to the present invention are obtained by foaming and expanding composite resin particles which have a polypropylene based resin core layer covered with a specific polyolefin based resin cover layer containing electrically conductive carbon black to such a degree as to provide a specific range of apparent density. This makes it possible to stably obtain a polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as molded article having a surface resistivity in the range of 1 10to 1 10 in a stable manner.

Because the expanded beads of the present invention show only a small variation of their electrical resistivity by a change in their apparent density the molded article obtained from the expanded beads of the present invention shows smaller change in its surface resistivity due to changes in molding conditions and in molding devices compared with the conventional polypropylene based resin expanded beads molded article containing an inorganic electrically conductive material and exhibits electrostatic dissipative properties in a stable manner even when the article has a complicated shape.

Description is hereinafter made of the expanded bead of the present invention. The expanded bead has a structure in which at least a part of a polypropylene based resin expanded core layer hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as expanded core layer is covered with a cover layer of a mixed resin containing electrically conductive carbon black hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as cover layer . As used herein the term polypropylene based resin is intended to refer to a resin composition containing a polypropylene resin as its major ingredient. The expanded core layer of the expanded bead according to the present invention is constituted of the resin composition. The resin composition will be also occasionally referred to in the present specification as base resin .

The mixed resin constituting the cover layer of the expanded bead contains a polypropylene resin hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as PP resin and a polyethylene resin hereinafter occasionally referred to as PE resin . The PP resin forms a continuous phase while the PE resin forms dispersed phases that are dispersed in the continuous phase. Electrically conductive carbon black hereinafter occasionally referred to as CB is unevenly distributed to the dispersed phases side. The weight ratio of the PP resin to the PE resin falls within a specific range and the content of the CB also falls within a specific range.

The expanded beads may be obtained by foaming and expanding composite resin particles hereinafter occasionally referred to as resin particles each having a polypropylene based resin core layer covered with a mixed resin cover layer containing CB. The polypropylene based resin core layer of the resin particles turns into the expanded core layer of the expanded beads while the cover layer of the resin particles turns into the cover layer of the expanded beads. Thus the CB containing mixed resin constituting the cover layer of the expanded beads is the same as the CB containing mixed resin constituting the cover layer of the resin particles. Also the polypropylene based resin constituting the expanded core layer of the expanded beads is the same as the polypropylene based resin constituting the core layer of the resin particles.

The cover layer of the expanded beads is next described. The cover layer may be in an expanded or unexpanded state but is preferably substantially unexpanded in order to obtain a molded article which exhibits stable electrostatic dissipating properties and a high degree of mechanical strength. The term substantially unexpanded used herein is intended to refer not only the case where no cells are formed including the case where cells once formed in an early stage of the expansion of the resin particles are melted and destroyed in a later stage but also the case where microcells are present in a small amount to the extent that the mechanical strength of the resulting molded article is not affected.

The expanded core layer of each expanded bead is covered with the cover layer. In this case it suffices that at least a part of the surface of the expanded core layer be covered with the cover layer. Namely it does not matter whether the core layer is completely covered with the cover layer or a part of the expanded core layer is exposed as long as the expanded beads can be fusion bonded to each other. As an example of the structure in which the expanded core layer is partially exposed there may be mentioned a case in which the expanded core layer has a cylindrical shape and in which only the peripheral surface thereof is covered with the cover layer with its top and bottom surfaces being exposed.

The cover layer contains a mixed resin composed of a PP resin and a PE resin and CB. The term PP resin as used herein refers to a resin containing 50 by weight or more of a propylene component unit. Examples of the PP resin include propylene homopolymers and copolymers of propylene with other olefin s copolymerizable therewith. Examples of the olefin copolymerizable with propylene include ethylene and olefins having four or more carbon atoms such as 1 butene. The copolymers may be random copolymers or block copolymers and may be binary copolymers or ternary copolymers. These PP resins may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more thereof.

The term PE resin as used herein refers to a resin containing 50 by weight or more preferably 70 by weight or more more preferably 80 by weight or more still more preferably 90 by weight or more of an ethylene component unit and may be an ethylene homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene with an olefin s having 4 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of the PE resin include high density polyethylene low density polyethylene linear low density polyethylene very low density polyethylene and mixtures of two or more thereof.

The CB contained in the cover layer preferably has a dibutyl phthalate DBP oil absorption amount of 150 to 700 ml 100 g more preferably 200 to 600 ml 100 g even more preferably 300 to 600 ml 100 g. Examples of the CB include acetylene black furnace black and channel black. The DBP oil absorption amount is measured according to ASTM D2414 79. The CB may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof. Among these furnace black is preferred oil furnace black is more preferred and Ketjen black is even more preferred because a high electrical conductivity can be achieved with the use of a small amount thereof.

In general when CB is dispersed in a thermoplastic resin such as polypropylene based resin electrical conductivity is generated because of the formation of an electrically conductive network structure in which adjacent CB particles are positioned close to each other within a given distance.

In the case of foamed bodies such as expanded beads the resin is stretched at the time of foaming. Thus when a CB containing resin is foamed and expanded the distance between CB is greater than that before expansion. When a sufficient amount of CB is incorporated in conventional CB containing electrically conductive polypropylene based resin expanded beads a large number of CB particles are still present close to each other in the polypropylene based resin even after the resin has been expanded and stretched. As a consequence the electrically conductive network structure is maintained and hence the molded article obtained from the expanded beads exhibits such an electrical conductivity as to provide a surface resistivity lower than 1 10 .

When the content of CB is reduced with a view toward achieving a medium degree of surface resistivity and obtaining electrostatic dissipating properties the distance between the CB particles increases. Therefore the number of CB particles present within the above mentioned given distance is so small that it is difficult to form an electrically conductive network even before foaming. Thus as the adding amount of CB decreases so called percolation phenomenon occurs and therefore the surface resistivity increases significantly.

Additionally in the case of a molded article of such expanded beads because the distance between the CB particles further increases as a result of stretching of the resin during the foaming and during the in mold molding it becomes more difficult to maintain the electrically conductive network. As a result a significant change in surface resistivity occurs and therefore it is difficult to achieve the electrostatic dissipating properties.

The expanded beads of the present invention on the other hand are obtained by foaming and expanding composite resin particles each having a polypropylene based resin core layer and a mixed resin cover layer to such a degree as to provide a specific apparent density range. In the cover layer of the resin particles there is formed a sea island structure composed of a PP resin continuous phase and PE resin dispersed phases with CB being distributed unevenly to the dispersed phases side. As a result in the cover layer of the expanded beads obtained by expanding such resin particles there is formed a sea island structure composed of a PP resin continuous phase and PE resin dispersed phases with CB being distributed unevenly to the dispersed phases side. Therefore by in mold molding the expanded beads a molded article having electrostatic dissipating properties is obtained in a stable manner.

The sea island structure of the resin particles may be formed by the following method. When a PP resin and a PE resin are melted and kneaded together with CB the CB is primarily present in distributed unevenly to the side of the PE resin which has a lower glass transition temperature than that of the PP resin so that the concentration of the CB in the PE resin phase is higher than that in the PP resin phase. Namely when the above three components are kneaded in such a way that the PE resin is dispersed in the PP resin namely in such a way as to form a sea phase of the PP resin and island phases of the PE resin the CB is distributed unevenly to the side of the PE resin dispersed phases that are dispersed in the PP resin continuous phase.

It is believed that the formation of the sea island structure results in the development of the electrostatic dissipating properties for the following reasons. In the cover layer of the expanded beads the CB is contained in the PE resin dispersed phases dispersed in the PP resin continuous phase and forms an electrically conductive network in the dispersed phases. Because the CB is restrained in the PE resin the movement thereof is restricted and the distance between CB particles does not significantly increase when the cover layer is stretched at the time of foaming. It is inferred that for this reason the electrically conductive network of the CB in the dispersed phases is maintained while the volume resistivity of the dispersed phases has such a low value as to show electrical conductivity.

In addition the PE resin of the present invention has moderate affinity with the PP resin but is not completely compatible therewith. Thus the PE resin is not considered to be excessively finely dispersed in the continuous phase of the PP resin. Further the PE resin dispersed phases are considered not to excessively deform following the deformation of the PP resin continuous phase during the foaming. For this reason the dispersed phases which themselves show electrical conductivity can maintain between them a distance that is necessary to ensure the desired electrostatic dissipating properties.

Because the expanded beads of the present invention have a composite structure and because the above described sea island structure is formed only in the cover layer the electrostatic dissipating properties are achieved in a stable manner independently from the apparent density expansion ratio thereof in other words even when the expansion ratio is changed.

The PE resin used in the present invention is preferably an ethylene homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene with an olefin having 4 to 6 carbon atoms. Such a PE resin has especially suitable affinity with the PP resin and therefore the electrostatic dissipating properties can be developed in a more stable manner.

Among the above mentioned PE resins linear low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene are preferred and linear low density polyethylene is more preferred. The linear low density polyethylene PE LLD is generally a copolymer of ethylene with an olefin such as butene and hexene and has a density of generally 0.88 g cmor higher and lower than 0.94 g cm preferably 0.91 g cmor higher and lower than 0.94 g cm. The high density polyethylene PE HD is generally a homopolymer of ethylene or a copolymer of ethylene with butene and has a density of generally 0.94 g cmor higher preferably 0.94 to 0.97 g cm.

The mixing proportion of the PP resin and the PE resin in the mixed resin constituting the cover layer is 99.5 0.5 to 50 50 in terms of weight ratio of the PP resin to the PE resin PP resin PE resin . When the proportion of the PE resin is excessively low the distance between PE resin dispersed phases is increased or a significant amount of CB is present in the PP resin continuous phase. As a result it is difficult to stably achieve the desired surface resistivity. On the other hand when the proportion of the PE resin is excessively high it becomes difficult for the PE resin to form dispersed phases or the distance between the dispersed phases is excessively decreased. As a result it is also difficult to stably achieve the desired surface resistivity. From this point of view the weight ratio of the PP resin to the PE resin is preferably 99.5 0.5 to 65 35 more preferably 99.5 0.5 to 70 30 still more preferably 99 1 to 75 25 particularly preferably 99 1 to 80 20 most preferably 98 2 to 85 15.

The mixing proportion of the CB is 5 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the mixed resin composed of the PP resin and the PE resin. When the mixing amount of the CB is outside the above range it is not possible to obtain the desired surface resistivity in a stable manner. When Ketjen black is used as the CB the mixing amount thereof is preferably 5 to 15 parts by weight more preferably 6 to 14 parts by weight still more preferably 7 to 13 parts by weight particularly preferably 8 to 12 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the PP resin and the PE resin that constitute the base resin in order to achieve a medium degree of surface resistivity in the range of 1 10to 1 10 in a stable manner. When acetylene black is used as the CB the mixing amount thereof is preferably 23 to 27 parts by weight more preferably 24 to 26 parts by weight per 100 by weight of the total amount of the PP resin and the PE resin that constitute base resin. Ketjen black is more preferred because a desired surface resistivity can be achieved with the addition of a small amount thereof.

The CB typically has an average particle size of 0.01 to 100 m. From the view point of dispersibility of the CB in the PE resin dispersed phases the average particle size thereof is preferably 10 to 80 nm more preferably 15 to 60 nm.

The average particle size of the CB is measured using an electron microscope. Specifically electron microscope photographs of the CB are taken so that several hundred particles thereof are contained in each field of view. The diameters in a specific direction Green diameters of randomly selected 1 000 particles are measured. Then a number based cumulative distribution curve is created from the obtained values and the 50 cumulative diameter in the number based distribution is adopted as the average particle size.

For reasons of forming the above described dispersion structure in a stable manner in the present invention it is preferred that the melting point of the PE resin is in the range of 30 to 150 C. and at the same time is lower than that of the PP resin. When the melting point of the PE resin is in the above described range the PE resin dispersed phases can sufficiently follow the stretching of the cover layer during expansion stage. As a consequence an electrically conductive net work structure between the PE resin dispersed phases may be easily formed.

The melting point Tm as used herein is measured by adopting measurement of melting temperature after the sample has been subjected to specified heat treatment as described in JIS K7121 1987 The heating rate and the cooling rate used in the adjustment of the conditions of the sample are each 10 C. minute . The resulting sample is heated with a DSC device at a heating rate of 10 C. minute for measuring a DSC curve. The peak top temperature of an endothermic peak ascribed to the fusion of the resin is the melting point. When a plurality of endothermic peaks are present in the DSC curve the peak top temperature of the endothermic peak that has the highest peak height represents the melting point. As the measuring device there may be used DSCQ1000 manufacture by TA Instruments Inc.

The PE resin preferably has a melt flow rate MFR which is 0.001 to 15 times that of the PP resin. The MFR of the PE resin is more preferably 0.001 to 11 times still more preferably 0.001 to 10 times that of the PP resin for reasons of formation of the above described dispersion structure in a stable manner.

The PP resin may be one that has a melt flow rate MFR of 0.1 to 30 g 10 min. The MFR of the PP resin is more preferably 2 to 20 g 10 min still more preferably 3 to 15 g 10 min. The MFR of the PE resin is generally 0.001 to 100 g 10 min more preferably 0.01 to 90 g 10 min. The MFR of the PE resin and PP resin is measured according to JIS K7210 1999 test condition M 230 C. and a load of 2.16 kg .

The cover layer of the expanded beads according to the present invention may contain an additional thermoplastic resin or thermoplastic elastomer other than the PP resin and the PE resin to the extent that the intended purpose is not impaired. Examples of the thermoplastic resin include polystyrene based resins such as polystyrene impact resistant polystyrene and styrene acrylonitrile copolymers acrylic based resins such as methyl polymethacrylate and polyester based resins such as polylactic acid and polyethylene terephthalate. Examples of the thermoplastic elastomer include olefin based elastomers such as ethylene hexene copolymers and ethylene propylene diene copolymers and styrene based elastomers such as styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers styrene isoprene styrene block copolymers and hydrogenated products thereof.

In addition the cover layer may further contain additives such as a catalyst neutralizing agent a lubricant and a crystal nucleating agent. However the additives are preferably added in such an amount that the object of the present invention is not impaired and in as small an amount as possible. The using amount of the additives is preferably 15 parts by weight or less more preferably 10 parts by weight or less still more preferably 5 parts by weight or less especially preferably 1 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the total of the base resin although it depends on the type and the purpose of use of the additives.

The PP resin constituting the cover layer preferably has a melting point lower than that of the polypropylene based resin constituting the expanded core layer. In the expanded beads having such a constitution when the expanded beads are heated for in mold molding to a temperature at which the expanded core layer is fusible the cover layer is softened earlier than the expanded core layer. As a result excellent fusion bonding properties between the expanded beads are obtainable. In addition because the cell structure in the expanded core layer becomes less likely to be damaged during the in mold molding it is possible to obtain a molded article which has excellent mechanical properties and does not undergo a significant shrinkage after molding can be obtained.

In addition when the melting point of the PP resin constituting the cover layer is lower than that of the polypropylene based resin constituting the expanded core layer the cover layer is prevented from being in an expanded state. One possible reason why the obtained cover layer is not brought into an expanded state is that under the conditions under which the composite resin particles are expanded the relationship between the expandability and viscoelasticity of the resin constituting the cover layer is not suited for maintaining or forming an expanded state. Further the cover layer is considered to be smoothly extended during the expansion so that the electrostatic dissipating properties thereof can be developed in a stable manner.

From this point of view it is preferred that the PP resin of the cover layer has a melting point lower than that of the polypropylene based resin of the expanded core layer by 0 to 80 C. more preferably by 1 to 80 C. more preferably by 5 to 60 C. still more preferably by 10 to 50 C. especially preferably by 15 to 45 C.

Description will be next made of the polypropylene based resin expanded core layer that constitutes the expanded beads of the present invention. The expanded core layer is formed of a base resin containing a polypropylene based resin. The polypropylene based resin may be similar to the PP resin that constitutes the cover layer. Among the PP resins a polypropylene ethylene random copolymer a propylene butene random copolymer or polypropylene ethylene butene random copolymer is preferable used for reasons of good balance between the foam moldability and mechanical properties.

The expanded core layer of the present invention may contain a thermoplastic resin or thermoplastic elastomer other than the PP resin to the extent that the intended purpose is not impaired. Examples of the thermoplastic resin include polyolefin based resins such as polyethylene polystyrene based resins such as polystyrene impact resistant polystyrene and styrene acrylonitrile copolymers acrylic based resins such as methyl polymethacrylate and polyester based resins such as polylactic acid and polyethylene terephthalate. Examples of the thermoplastic elastomer include olefin based elastomers such as ethylene hexene copolymers and ethylene propylene diene copolymers and styrene based elastomers such as styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers styrene isoprene styrene block copolymers and hydrogenated products thereof.

In addition the expanded core layer may contain additives such as a colorant a lubricant a catalyst neutralizing agent and an antioxidant to the extent that the object of the present invention is not impaired. An electrically conductive inorganic substance such as CB may be also added. The adding amount of the additives is preferably 15 parts by weight or less more preferably 10 parts by weight or less even more preferably 5 parts by weight or less especially preferably 1 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin based resin although it depends on the type of the additives.

Because the expanded beads of the expanded beads according to the present invention has a specific cover layer the resulting molded article exhibits electrostatic dissipating properties even if the expanded core layer does not contain an electrically conductive material of CB. In particular when the expanded core layer does not contain an electrically conductive material the expanded beads have excellent expansion moldability and therefore will have a high closed cell content. As a result an expanded beads molded article obtained therefrom shows only a small contraction after in mold molding and has high dimensional stability and high productivity. In addition since the internal pressure in the expanded beads can be increased easily expanded beads having a low apparent density high expansion ratio can be obtained easily.

The weight ratio of the expanded core layer to the cover layer expanded core layer cover layer is preferably 99 1 to 50 50 more preferably 99 1 to 70 30 still more preferably 98 2 to 75 25 especially preferably 96 4 to 80 20 from the standpoint of achievement of stable electrostatic dissipation properties of a surface resistivity of 1 10to 1 10 while maintaining proper moldability of the expanded beads and physical properties of the obtained molded article. The weight ratio of the expanded core layer to the cover layer can be adjusted by for example adjusting the ratio of the amount of feed of the ingredients of the resin particle core layer to the amount of feed of the ingredients of the resin particle cover layer at the time of production of the composite resin particles as described later.

The cover layer of the expanded beads preferably has an average thickness of 0.2 m or greater more preferably 1 m or greater still more preferably 3 m or greater especially preferably 5 m or greater in order to achieve more stable electrostatic dissipating properties. The stability of the electrostatic dissipating properties does not increase when the cover layer is excessively thick. For this reason the upper limit of the average thickness of the cover layer is preferably 200 m more preferably 100 m still more preferably 50 m.

In the present invention the average thickness of the cover layer is calculated based on the weight apparent density and L length D diameter ratio of the expanded beads the weight proportion of the resin in the resin particle core layer of the composite resin particles before expansion the density of the cover layer and so on because the boundary between the expanded core layer and the cover layer is not clear and because the thickness of the cover layer is difficult to measure when it is small. The average thickness of the cover layer of the expanded beads is calculated based on the assumption that the composite resin particles are expanded into expanded beads having a similar shape for simplicity of the calculation.

Specifically when expanded beads are obtained from cylindrical composite resin particles the average thickness Tt of the cover layer of the expanded beads can be calculated for example using the following equations 1 to 3 . 4 1 wherein Pd represents the diameter cm of the cylindrical expanded beads W represents the weight g of the composite resin particles Db represents the apparent density g cm of the expanded beads and Ld represents the L D ratio of the expanded beads in the case where the composite resin particles are expanded into a similar shape. 4 2 wherein Cd represents the diameter cm of the core layer of the cylindrical expanded beads R represents the weight proportion non dimensional of the cover layer in the composite resin particles and represents the density g cm of the cover layer. 2 10000 3 

When the expanded beads are obtained from spherical composite resin particles the average thickness Tt of the cover layer of the expanded beads can be calculated using the equation 5 which is obtained by transforming the equation 4 below. 6 2 10000 4 6 20000 5 wherein d represents the diameter cm of the spherical composite resin particles S represents the weight g of the cover layer of the composite resin particles X represents the expansion ratio non dimensional of the expanded beads i.e. density g cm of the composite resin particles apparent density Db g cm of the expanded beads and represents the density g cm of the cover layer.

A desired average thickness of the cover layer of the expanded beads can be achieved by adjusting the weight ratio of the cover layer to the core layer in the composite resin particles and the L D ratio and diameter of the composite resin particles based on the desired apparent density expansion ratio of the expanded beads.

The expanded beads of the present invention are obtained by expanding the above described composite resin particles so as to have an apparent density of 10 to 120 kg mand show dielectric dissipating properties in a stable manner. When the apparent density of the expanded beads is excessively low there is a possibility that the molded article obtained therefrom shows reduced mechanical strength and fails to exhibit dielectric dissipating properties in a stable manner. When the apparent density is excessively high on the other hand there is a possibility that the resulting molded article has such an excessively large weight as to deteriorate its light weight property and also fails to exhibit dielectric dissipating properties in a stable manner. For these reasons the apparent density of the expanded beads is preferably 12 to 90 kg m more preferably 15 to 60 kg m still more preferably 20 to 50 kg m.

The apparent density of the expanded beads may be determined as follows. In a measuring cylinder containing water at 23 C. a group of the expanded beads weight of the group is W g are immersed using a wire net etc. From a rise of the water level the volume V cm of the expanded beads group is determined. The apparent density is calculated by dividing the weight of the expanded beads group by the volume thereof WN followed by unit conversion into kg cm .

The expanded beads preferably have an average cell diameter of 20 to 400 m more preferably 40 to 200 m not only because of excellent in mold moldability thereof but also because the expanded beads molded article obtained after the molding has good dimension recovery characteristics and excellent mechanical properties such as compressive properties.

As used herein the average cell diameter of the expanded beads is measured as follows. One expanded bead is cut into nearly equal halves. From an enlarged photo image of the cross section taken by a microscope the average cell diameter is determined as follows. On the enlarged image of the cross section of the expanded bead four line segments each passing nearly through the center of the cross section and extending from one surface of the expanded bead to the other surface thereof are drawn such that eight angularly equally spaced straight lines extend radially from nearly the center of the cross section toward the external surface of the expanded bead. A total number N of cells that intersect the above four line segments is counted. Also measured is a total length L m of the four line segments. The value L N obtained by dividing the total length L by the total number N is an average cell diameter of the expanded bead. Similar procedures are repeated for 10 expanded beads in total. The arithmetic mean of the average cell diameters of the ten expanded beads represents the average cell diameter of the expanded beads.

The expanded beads preferably have a closed cell content of 75 or more more preferably 80 or more still more preferably 82 or more. When the closed cell content is within the above range the expanded beads show sufficiently high secondary expansion property and easily give an expanded beads molded article having excellent mechanical properties.

As used herein the closed cell content of the expanded beads is measured as follows. The expanded beads are allowed to stand for 10 days for aging in a thermostatic chamber at 23 C. under atmospheric pressure and a relative humidity of 50 . In the same thermostatic chamber about 20 cmbulk volume of the expanded beads thus aged are sampled and measured for the precise apparent volume Va by a water immersion method. The sample whose apparent volume Va has been measured is fully dried and measured for its true volume Vx according to Procedure C of ASTM D 2856 70 using Air Comparison Pycnometer Type 930 manufactured by Toshiba Beckman Inc. From the volumes Va and Vx the closed cell content is calculated by the formula 6 . The arithmetic mean of the 5 measured values is the closed cell content of the expanded beads N 5 . Closed cell content 100 6 

Vx represents the true volume cm of the expanded beads measured by the above method which corresponds to a sum of a volume of the resin constituting the expanded beads and a total volume of all the closed cells in the expanded beads 

Va represents an apparent volume cm of the expanded beads which is measured by a rise of the water level when the expanded beads are immersed in water contained in a measuring cylinder 

It is also preferred that the expanded beads of the present invention have secondary crystals and that the heat of fusion of the secondary crystals as measured by differential thermal analysis is 1 to 30 J g. Namely it is preferred that the expanded beads when measured by heat flux differential scanning calorimetry in which 2 to 10 mg thereof are heated from 23 C. to 220 C. at a heating rate of 10 C. min give a DSC curve first heating run DSC curve having an endothermic peak A which is intrinsic to the polypropylene based resin hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as intrinsic peak and one or more endothermic peaks B hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as high temperature peak which are located on a higher temperature side of the intrinsic peak and that the heat of fusion of the high temperature peak hereinafter occasionally referred to as high temperature peak calorific value is 1 to 30 J g. When the high temperature peak calorific value is within the above range the expanded beads show excellent fusion bonding properties and can give an expanded beads molded article having excellent mechanical properties.

The upper limit of the high temperature peak calorific value is preferably 18 J g more preferably 17 J g still more preferably 16 J g while the lower limit thereof is preferably 4 J g. Incidentally the high temperature peak of the expanded beads may be controlled by any known manner. One controlling method is disclosed in for example Japanese Patent Publication No. JP A 2001 151928.

As used herein the first heating run DSC curve calorific value of the intrinsic peak and high temperature peak calorific value are measured by a measuring method according to JIS K7122 1987 as follows.

Expanded bead s 2 to 10 mg are sampled and heated using a differential scanning calorimeter from 23 C. to 220 C. at a heating rate of 10 C. minute to obtain a first heating run DSC curve an example of which is shown in .

The DSC curve shown in has an intrinsic peak A attributed to the polypropylene based resin forming the expanded beads and a high temperature peak B located on a high temperature side of the intrinsic peak. The quantity of heat of the high temperature peak B corresponds to the area of the peak and is determined in the manner specifically described below. First a straight line extending between a point on the DSC curve at 80 C. and a point on the DSC curve at a melting completion temperature T of the expanded beads is drawn. The melting completion temperature T is a temperature of an intersection at which the DSC curve on a high temperature side of the high temperature peak B meets the base line. Next a line which is parallel with the ordinate and which passes a point on the DSC curve at the bottom of the valley between the intrinsic peak A and the high temperature peak B is drawn. This line crosses the line at a point . The area of the high temperature peak B is the area hatched portion in bounded by the curve of the high temperature peak B the line segment and the line segment and corresponds to the high temperature peak calorific value.

Incidentally the high temperature peak s B appears in the DSC curve measured in the first heating run as described above but does not appear in the DSC curve obtained during heating in the second heating run. In the second heating run DSC curve only the endothermic peak inherent to the polypropylene based resin forming the expanded beads is present.

Description will be next made of a method for producing the polypropylene based resin expanded beads of the present invention. The expanded beads of the present invention may be obtained by expanding composite resin particles each having a polypropylene based resin particle core layer and a CB containing mixed resin cover layer which covers the core layer.

The composite resin particles used in the present invention may be obtained as follows. A device having two extruders i.e. an extruder for forming a resin particle core layer and an extruder for forming a resin particle cover layer which are connected to a coextrusion die is used. A required polypropylene based resin and if needed additives such as a cell controlling agent are fed to the extruder for forming a resin particle core layer and melted and kneaded to obtain a molten resin for forming the resin particle core layer. On the other hand required PP resin PE resin and CB are fed to the extruder for forming a resin particle cover layer and melted and kneaded to obtain a molten resin for forming the resin particle cover layer. The molten resin for forming the resin particle core layer is fed into a coextrusion die to form a linear flow. At the same time the molten resin for forming the resin particle cover layer is fed into the coextrusion die so that the linear flow of the molten resin for forming the resin particle core layer is surrounded by and laminated with the molten resin for forming the resin particle cover layer thereby forming a molten resin composition that has a core sheath structure. The molten resin composition is then extruded in the form of a plurality of strands through small holes of a mouthpiece attached to an exit at a tip of the extruder. Composite resin particles may be obtained by a method for example by cutting the strands into suitable lengths after having been passed through water or by simultaneously cutting and cooling the strands as soon as the molten resin composition has been extruded through the die into water. In the present specification the composite structure thus formed is occasionally referred to as core sheath structure.

The method for producing composite resin particles using the above described coextrusion die is disclosed in detail in for example Japanese Examined Patent Publications Nos. JP S41 16125 JP S43 23858 and JP S44 29522 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. JP A S60 185816.

In the cover layer which constitutes the expanded beads of the present invention it is important that the PP resin should form a continuous phase that the PE resin should form dispersed phases which are dispersed in the continuous phase and that the CB should be contained in the PE resin. Therefore it is necessary to prepare the composite resin particles in such a way that the above structure is formed in the resin particle cover layer. To form such a structure it is preferred that a master batch in which the CB is dispersed in the PP resin is previously prepared and the resulting master batch the PE resin and if necessary an additional amount of the PP resin are fed to and kneaded in the extruder although the PP resin PE resin and CB can be fed directly to and kneaded in the extruder for forming the cover layer.

The concentration of the CB in the master batch is preferably 5 to 50 by weight more preferably 8 to 30 by weight still more preferably 9 to 25 by weight. The master batch is preferably added with an olefin based elastomer in order to improve dispersibility of CB in the master batch. The addition amount of the olefin based elastomer is preferably 3 to 10 by weight. Examples of the olefin elastomer include an ethylene octene copolymerized elastomer and an ethylene propylene diene copolymerized elastomer.

In order to control the cell diameter of the expanded core layer it is preferred that a cell controlling agent is added into the resin particle core layer. As the cell controlling agent there may be mentioned an inorganic powder such as talc calcium carbonate borax zinc borate aluminum hydroxide and alum. The cell controlling agent is preferably used in an amount of 0.001 to 10 parts by weight more preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the base resin. Although the cell controlling agent may be added as such into the base resin of the resin particle core layer it is preferred that the cell controlling agent is added in the form of a master batch for reasons of improved dispersion efficiency.

The composite resin particles each preferably have a weight of 0.02 to 20 mg more preferably 0.1 to 6 mg since the expanded beads can be uniformly filled in a mold cavity.

The expanded beads of the present invention may be prepared from the above described composite resin particles by for example so called dispersing medium releasing foaming method. In this method the composite resin particles are dispersed in a dispersing medium such as water contained in a closed vessel such as autoclave together with a physical blowing agent etc. The dispersing medium is then heated to a temperature not lower than the softening point of the resin particles to impregnate the resin particles with the blowing agent. Then while maintaining the pressure inside the closed vessel at a pressure not lower than the vapor pressure of the blowing agent an end portion of the closed vessel that is located beneath the water level is opened to release the blowing agent impregnated expandable resin particles together with the dispersing medium such as water from the closed vessel to an atmosphere which is maintained at a pressure lower than that in the closed vessel generally atmospheric pressure to foam and expand the resin particles thereby obtaining the expanded beads of the present invention. In an alternative method the blowing agent impregnated expandable resin particles are taken out of the closed vessel and heated with a suitable heating medium such steam to foam and expand the resin particles.

In a further alternative preparation of the composite resin particles in the above extrusion device may be modified such that a blowing agent is injected into an extruder for forming the core layer to obtain a foamable molten resin composition. The foamable molten resin composition is laminated with the above described molten resin for forming the cover layer to obtain a melt stream having a sheath core structure. By extruding the melt stream having a sheath core structure through a die the extrudate expands and foams.

The release of the composite resin particles from a higher pressure zone in which no expansion thereof takes place to a lower pressure zone in which the expansion thereof takes place is preferably performed such that a difference in pressure therebetween is generally at least 400 kPa preferably 500 to 15 000 kPa.

The blowing agent used in the dispersing medium release foaming method is generally an organic physical blowing agent such as propane isobutane normal butane isopentane normal pentane cyclopentane normal hexane cyclobutane cyclohexane chlorofluoromethane trifluoromethane 1 1 1 2 tetrafluoroethane 1 chloro 1 1 difluoroethane 1 1 difluoroethane and 1 chloro 1 2 2 2 tetrafluoroethane or an inorganic physical blowing agent such as nitrogen carbon dioxide argon and air. For reasons of freedom of destruction of the ozone layer and low costs the use of inorganic physical blowing agent especially nitrogen air and carbon dioxide is preferred. The above blowing agents may be used in combination of two or more thereof.

The amount of the blowing agent is determined as appropriate in view of relationship between the intended apparent density of the expanded beads and the foaming temperature. More specifically the blowing agent other than nitrogen and air is generally used in an amount of 2 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin particles. In the case of nitrogen and air the blowing agent is used in an amount so that the pressure within the closed vessel is in the range of 1 to 7 MPa G .

As the dispersing medium for dispersing the resin particles in the closed vessel water is preferred. However other media such as ethylene glycol glycerin methanol and ethanol may be used as long as the resin particles are not dissolved therein.

The average cell diameter may be controlled by adjustment of the kind and amount of the blowing agent the expansion temperature and the amount of the cell controlling agent. The apparent density expansion ratio may be controlled by adjustment of the kind of the blowing agent the expansion temperature and the above described difference in pressure at the time of the foaming. The apparent density of the expanded beads is generally smaller with an increase of the amount of the blowing agent the expansion temperature and the pressure difference.

A melt adhesion preventing agent may be used for the purpose of preventing the resin particles from melt adhering to each other during heating of the dispersion of the base resin particles in the dispersing medium to the foaming temperature. Any inorganic and organic substance may be used as the melt adhesion preventing agent as long as they are insoluble in water etc. and are not fused upon being heated. Inorganic substances are generally preferred.

Examples of the inorganic melt adhesion preventing agent include powders of kaolin talc mica aluminum oxide titanium oxide and aluminum hydroxide. The melt adhesion preventing agent preferably has an average particle diameter of 0.001 to 100 m more preferably 0.001 to 30 m and is preferably used in an amount of 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin particles.

A dispersing aid such as an anionic surfactant e.g. sodium dodecylbenzenesulonate and sodium oleate and aluminum sulfate may be suitably used. The dispersing aid is preferably added in an amount of 0.001 to 5 parts by eight per 100 parts by weight of the resin particles.

When low apparent density expanded beads are to be produced it is desirable to conduct so called two step expansion in which expanded beads are produced by the above described dispersing medium releasing foaming method or the like method the obtained expanded beads being thereafter subjected to a further expansion treatment. In the two step expansion method the expanded beads obtained are charged in a pressure resistant closed vessel and are subjected to a pressurizing treatment using a gas such as air so that the inner pressure in the expanded beads is increased to 0.01 to 0.6 MPa G . The resulting expanded beads are then taken out of the closed vessel and heated with a heating medium such as steam thereby to obtain expanded beads having a lowered apparent density.

The molded article according to the present invention may be produced by filling the above described expanded beads in a mold cavity and heating the expanded beads with steam for molding by customarily known method as needed. More specifically the expanded beads are filled in a mold cavity which can be closed but not airtightly. Thereafter steam is fed into the mold cavity to heat and expand the expanded beads and to fusion bond the expanded beads to each other thereby obtaining the molded article having a shape conforming to the mold cavity. If desired the expanded beads may be subjected to a pressurizing treatment to increase the inside pressure of the expanded beads to 0.01 to 0.2 MPa G in the same manner as that of the step of the above described two step expansion.

After the molding by fusion bonding of the expanded beads has been completed the molded article may be cooled within the mold cavity. The cooling may be carried out by a water cooling method. The cooling may be also carried out by a vacuum method in which the cooling is performed by utilizing the heat of vaporization of steam.

The desired molded article may be also obtained by a method in which the expanded beads are compressively filled in the mold cavity with a compression ratio of 4 to 25 volume more preferably 5 to 20 volume and then in mold molded with steam.

The compression ratio can be controlled by charging the expanded beads in the mold cavity in an amount greater than the inside volume of the mold cavity. When expanded beads are filled in a mold cavity there may be adopted a filling method in a cracking mode in which at the time of the filling of the expanded beads into the mold cavity the mold is not in a fully closed state for the purpose of discharging air in the mold cavity out of the mold and of efficiently filling the expanded beads in the mold cavity. The cracking refers to an opened portion of the mold. The cracking is finally fully closed after completion of the filling of the expanded beads so that the expanded beads are compressed before steam is fed into the mold cavity.

The molded article of the present invention preferably has a closed cell content of 75 or more more preferably 80 or more still more preferably 82 or more particularly preferably 85 or more. When the closed cell content is within the above range the molded article has good mechanical properties.

The closed cell content of the molded article is measured as follows. The molded article is allowed to stand for aging for 10 days in a thermostatic chamber at 23 C. under atmospheric pressure and a relative humidity of 50 . A sample with a size of 25 25 20 mm is cut out from the aged molded article and measured for its closed cell content in the same manner as that for the above described measurement of the closed cell content of the expanded beads.

The molded article of the present invention has a surface resistivity of 1 10to 1 10 preferably 1 10to 1 10 and hence exhibits stable electrostatic dissipative property. For this reason the molded article can be suitably used as packaging materials for electronic parts such as integrated circuits and hard disks. As used herein the surface resistivity is a value as measured according to JIS C2170 2004 Paragraph 8 Measurement of resistance of static dissipative material used to prevention of accumulation of electrostatic charge .

In Examples 1 to 15 a PP resin a PE resin and a CB master batch were fed to a twin screw extruder having an inside diameter of 30 mm such that the kinds and amounts of the PP resin PE resin CB and olefin based elastomer were as shown in Tables 5 and 6. In the extruder they were heated melted and kneaded at a determined temperature of 200 to 220 C. The kneaded mass was extruded into strands. The strands were cooled with water and cut with a pelletizer to obtain electrically conductive resin pellets for forming a resin particle cover layer. As the CB master batch MB1 was used in the examples other than Examples 6 and 9 MB2 was used in Example 6 and MB3 was used in Example 9.

In Comparative Examples 1 to 3 a PP resin and a CB master batch were fed to a twin screw extruder having an inside diameter of 30 mm so that the kinds and amounts of the PP resin and CB were as shown in Table 7. In the extruder they were heated melted and kneaded at a determined temperature of 200 to 220 C. The kneaded mass was extruded into strands. The strands were cooled with water and cut with a pelletizer to obtain electrically conductive resin pellets for forming a resin particle cover layer. As the CB master batch MB2 was used in the Comparative Examples 1 and 2 and MB3 was used in Comparative Example 3.

In Comparative Examples 4 to 7 a PP resin CB master batch MB1 and EO1 as an olefin based elastomer were fed to a twin screw extruder having an inside diameter of 30 mm such that the kinds and amounts of the PP resin CB and olefin based elastomer were as shown in Table 6. In the extruder they were heated melted and kneaded at a determined temperature of 200 to 220 C. The kneaded mass was extruded into strands. The strands were cut with a pelletizer to obtain electrically conductive resin pellets for forming a resin particle cover layer. The olefin based elastomer is referred to in Tables 5 to 7 simply as elastomer.

An extrusion device having an extruder for forming a resin particle core layer inside diameter 65 mm an extruder for forming a resin particle cover layer inside diameter 30 mm and a coextrusion die for forming multi layer strands which was attached to exits of the extruders was used. The PP resin the kind of which is shown in Tables 5 to 7 as a polypropylene based resin was fed to the extruder with an inside diameter of 65 mm for forming a resin particle core layer while the above described electrically conductive resin pellets were fed to the extruder with an inside diameter of 30 mm for forming a resin particle cover layer. The materials thus fed were each heated melted and kneaded at a determined temperature of 200 to 220 C. and thereafter introduced into the coextrusion die and combined. The combined stream was then coextruded in the form of multi layer strands in which the peripheral surface of each core layer is covered with an outer layer through small holes of a mouthpiece attached to a die exit of the extruder. The coextruded strands were cooled with water and cut with a pelletizer into columnar composite resin particles each having a weight of 2 mg an L D ratio of 2.4 and a two layer core sheath structure.

The weight and L D herein are each arithmetic mean value of randomly selected 100 composite resin particles. Into the polypropylene based resin feed for forming the resin particle core layer zinc borate as a cell controlling agent was added in an amount so that the content of the zinc borate in the resin particle core layer was 1 000 ppm by weight and MB4 was also added as the black colorant in an amount 7 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polypropylene based resin.

The thus obtained composite resin particles 1 kg were charged in a 5 L autoclave together with 3 L of water as a dispersing medium to which 3 g of kaolin as a dispersing agent 0.04 g of sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate and 0.1 g of aluminum sulfate as a dispersing aid were added. Carbon dioxide as a blowing agent was then injected into the autoclave in an amount so that the inside pressure of the autoclave was as shown in Tables 5 to 7. The contents were heated with stirring to a foaming temperature and maintained at the foaming temperature for 15 minutes to adjust the high temperature peak calorific value. Thereafter the contents in the autoclave were released to atmospheric pressure together with water to obtain expanded beads.

In Examples 4 and 5 and Comparative Examples 5 to 7 the expanded beads obtained above were subjected to a two step expansion treatment to obtain low apparent density expanded beads. Namely the obtained expanded beads were placed in a closed vessel adapted for pressurizing the expanded beads and pressurized with air so that the inside pressure of the expanded beads was increased to 0.5 MPa G . The resulting expanded beads were then taken out of the closed vessel and heated with steam.

The above obtained expanded beads were placed in a mold cavity adapted for forming a flat plate having a length of 250 mm a width of 200 mm and a thickness of 50 mm and subjected to in mold molding by steam heating to obtain plate like foamed molded articles. The heating was performed in such a way that steam was fed for 5 seconds for preheating air purging step while maintaining drain valves on both side molds in an open state and thereafter one direction flow heating was carried out at a pressure lower by 0.04 MPa G than that for full heating. Then reversed one direction flow heating was performed at a pressure lower by 0.02 MPa G than that for the full heating. Finally the full heating was performed at a molding heated steam pressure molding pressure shown in Tables 5 to 7. The molding pressure was a critical pressure at which the molded article has the highest fusion bonding without significant shrinkage. When the pressure was higher than the critical pressure the molded article showed either significant shrinkage or reduced fusion bonding property and hence was not the desired molded article. After completion of the heating the pressure was released and was cooled with water until its surface pressure attributed to its expansion force decreased to 0.04 MPa G . The mold was then opened. The molded article was taken out of the mold cavity and aged in an oven at 80 C. for 12 hours thereby obtaining the expanded beads molded article having physical properties shown in Tables 5 to 7. In Tables 5 to 7 1 shows that the measurement results are at 23 C. and 10 RH Environment Condition 1 while 2 shows that the measurement results are at 23 C. and 50 RH Environment Condition 2 .

The surface resistivity of the molded articles was measured under both Environment Condition 1 and Environment Condition 2. In the case of Environment Condition 1 the molded article was aged at 23 C. and 10 RH for 1 day immediately after the production thereof while in the case of Environment Condition 2 the molded article was aged at 23 C. and 50 RH for 1 day immediately after the production thereof. The aged molded articles was thereafter measured for its surface resistivity according to JIS C2170 2004 at 23 C. and 10 RH in the case of the molded article aged under Environment Condition 1 and at 23 C. and a relative humidity of 50 in the case of the molded article aged under Environment Condition 2. Thus a test piece having a length of 100 mm a width of 100 mm and a thickness equal to that of the molded article was cut out from a center part of each of the aged molded articles. The surface resistivity was measured on the skin surface of each test piece using a resistivity meter HIRESTA MCP HT450 manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Analytech Co. Ltd. . When the measured value was less than 1 10 the surface resistivity was again measured on the skin surface using resistivity meter LORESTA MCP HT610 manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Analytech Co. Ltd. .

The charge decay time of the molded article was measured under both Environment Condition 1 and Environment Condition 2. In the case of Environment Condition 1 the molded article was aged at 23 C. and 10 RH for 1 day immediately after the production thereof while in the case of Environment Condition 2 the molded article was aged at 23 C. and 50 RH for 1 day immediately after the production thereof. The charge decay was thereafter measured according to the method given below at 23 C. and 10 RH in the case of the molded article aged under Environment Condition 1 and at 23 C. and a relative humidity of 50 in the case of the molded article aged under Environment Condition 2.

The molded article test piece having a length of 150 mm a width of 150 mm and a thickness of 10 mm was cut out from each molded article such that the skin surface remained as such. The charge decay was measured using a measuring device Model 159HH manufactured by Trek Japan Co. Ltd. . Thus the test piece was placed on a measurement plate of the device and charged with a voltage of 1 300V. Thereafter a center part of the test piece on the side opposite from the measurement plate was grounded using a copper wire. The time required for the voltage to decay from 1 000V to 100V was measured. When the decay time was 2 seconds or shorter the charge decay was evaluated as being good o . The charge decay was evaluated as being no good x when the decay time was over 2 seconds.

A dispersion state of the PE resin in the PP resin continuous phase of the cover layer was investigated by the following method. A sample for observation was cut out from the cover layer embedded in an epoxy resin and stained with ruthenium tetraoxide. An ultrathin slice was then cut out using an ultramicrotome. The slice was placed on a grid and measured by a transmission electron microscope JEM1010 manufactured by JEOL Ltd. at 20 000 fold magnification to observe the morphology of the cross section of the cover layer of the expanded bead. is a microphotograph of the expanded bead obtained in Example 1 and is a microphotograph of the expanded bead obtained in Comparative Example 2. From it is seen that the PE resin which is stained and seen dark in the microphotograph is dispersed in the PP resin continuous phase 1. In the case of the expanded bead whose cover layer is composed only of the PP resin on the other hand CB is dispersed in the PP resin 1 in clusters as will be seen from .

For the purpose of confirming the dispersion state of CB the slice piece stained with ruthenium tetraoxide was discolored and measured by a transmission electron microscope JEM1010 manufactured by Hitachi Ltd. at 20 000 fold magnification. is a microphotograph of the expanded bead obtained in Example 3. From it is seen that in the expanded bead whose cover layer is constituted of a PP resin continuous phase and PE resin dispersed phases CB is present in the domains having nearly the same size as that of the dispersed phases.

The above described observation of morphology has revealed that in the cover layer of the expanded beads of Examples the PP resin forms a continuous phase matrix while the PE resin forms dispersed phases domains with the CB being more distributed unevenly to the dispersed phases.

Fusion bonding was evaluated as follows. The molded article was bent and ruptured. The ruptured cross section was observed to count a number C1 of the expanded beads present on the surface and a number C2 of the broken expanded beads among them. The percentage C2 C1 100 of the broken expanded beads based on the expanded beads was calculated as a material failure percentage. The above procedure was repeated five times in total. The arithmetic mean of the five material failure percentages represents the degree of fusion bonding. When the material failure percentage was 80 or higher the fusion bonding was evaluated as being good and shown as o in Tables 5 to 7. Otherwise the fusion bonding was no good and shown as x in Tables 5 to 7.

A group of expanded beads about 500 cm which had been allowed to stand at 23 C. a relative humidity of 50 under 1 atm for 2 days were weighed g and immersed in 300 cc water contained in a measuring cylinder using a wire net. From the rise of the water level in the measuring cylinder a volume V cm of the group of the expanded beads was measured. The apparent density kg m of the expanded beads was determined by dividing the weight W of the group of the expanded beads by the volume V thereof W V followed by unit conversion.

The average thickness of the cover layer of the expanded beads was determined from the afore mentioned relational expression with the shape of the composite expanded beads being regarded as being circular columnar.

From the obtained expanded beads 10 of them were sampled at random. Each expanded bead was measured by the above described method for its high temperature peak calorific value. The arithmetic mean of the ten measured values represents the high temperature peak calorific value of the expanded beads.

The apparent density of the molded article was calculated by dividing the weight of thereof by the volume thereof that was determined from the outer dimensions thereof followed by unit conversion kg m .
