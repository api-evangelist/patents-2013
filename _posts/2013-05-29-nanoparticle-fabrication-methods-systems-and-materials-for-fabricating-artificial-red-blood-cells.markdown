This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Grant No. CHE 9876674 awarded by the National Science Foundation and from the Office of Naval Research Grant No. N00014 02 1 0185. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Generally this invention relates to micro and or nano scale particle fabrication. More particularly the micro and or nano scale particles are fabricated to mimic red blood cells.

Mammalian red blood cells are critical for the delivery of oxygen to body tissues and the exchange of carbon dioxide from body tissues. One critical feature of red blood cells RBC is their ability to severely deform in shape to pass through intercellular gaps of sinusoids in the spleen and capillaries. Disorders of red blood cells can enhance rigidification of red blood cells and reduce their ability to pass through intercellular gaps and capillaries. Such rigidification is a key feature of the biology and pathophysiology of malaria Miller et al. 2002 Cooke et al. 2001 and Glenister et. al 2002 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . Sickle cell anemia is another RBC based condition which is caused by elongated RBCs. Furthermore over time RBCs stiffen and aged red blood cells are removed from the body after about 120 days. Therefore there exists a need to fabricate an artificial RBC which can deform in size to pass through intercellular gaps and capillaries and carry and exchange oxygen with carbon dioxide.

According to some embodiments an artificial red blood cell includes a plurality of particles where each particle of the plurality of particles is substantially monodisperse. In some embodiments each particle has a largest linear dimension of about 5 m to about 10 m and a modulus less than about 1 MPa. In some embodiments a particle of the plurality of particles can pass through a tube having an inner diameter of less than about 3 m.

According to some embodiments an artificial red blood cell includes a plurality of substantially monodisperse particles where each particle has substantially a disc shape. In some embodiments each particle has a diameter of about 5 m to about 10 m. In some embodiments each particle has a porosity configured to give the particle a modulus such that the particle can pass through a tube having an inner diameter of less than about 3 m.

According to some embodiments the particles include poly ethylene glycol . In some embodiments the particles include perfluoropolyether.

According to some embodiments the particles may include surface functionality and or cargo. In some embodiments the cargo is capable of binding and releasing oxygen.

The design and development of such systems mathematical modeling of transport from these systems and the in vivo use of these devices accumulate to their impact and potential use in a variety of disease states. Measurement of drug distribution in vascular tissue using quantitative fluorescence microscopy of the particles disclosed herein is one such system.

In some embodiments particles can be fabricated from biocompatible materials with solubility and or philicity control. The mesh density and charge can be altered to control factors such as modulus and release of cargo. In some embodiments particles can be designed with stimulated degradation for cargo release. Due to the unique manufacturing method described in pending PCT application PCT US06 23722 filed on Jun. 19 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including all references cited therein monodisperse particles can be made with shape and size specificity.

According to some embodiments particles may carry a wide variety of cargos. Particles may incorporate therapeutics such as small molecules proteins oligos siRNAs and pDNA imaging beacons for PET SPECT MR and ultrasound as well as organelles. In some embodiments no chemical modification of the cargo is needed. High loadability is also possible.

In some embodiments particles are amenable to surface functionalization for targeting and enhanced circulation. In some embodiments ligands on the surface allow for tailored bioavailability and enhanced electrostatic or steric stabilization. Non spherical particles have a unique ability to increase the number of surface ligands per cargo volume. The particles are also amenable to all dosage forms including injectables oral inhalation and dermatological.

Bid is a BH3 only member of the Bcl 2 family that regulates cell death at the level of mitochondrial membranes. Bid appears to link the mitochondrial pathway with the death receptor mediated pathway of cell death. It is generally assumed that the f.l. fulllength protein becomes activated after proteolytic cleavage especially by apical caspases like caspase 8. The cleaved protein then relocates to mitochondria and promotes membrane permeabilization presumably by interaction with mitochondrial lipids and other Bcl 2 proteins that facilitate the release of apoptogenic proteins like cytochrome c. Although the major action may reside in the C terminus part tBid cleaved Bid un cleaved Bid also has pro apoptotic potential when ectopically expressed in cells or in vitro. This pro apoptotic action of fl. Bid has remained unexplained especially at the biochemical level. In the article Pro apoptotic Bid Induces Membrane Perturbation by Inserting Selected Lysolipids into the Biolayer The University of Manchetser Biochem. J. 387 pp. 109 118 2005 available at http www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov articlerender.fcgi artid 1134938 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety Goonesinghe et al. explain that f.l. full length Bid can insert specific lysolipids into the membrane surface thereby priming mitochondria for the release of apoptogenic factors. This is reported to be most effective for lysophosphatidylcholine species to accumulate in mitochondria during apoptosis induction. A Bid mutant that is not pro apoptotic in vivo is defective in lysophosphatidylcholine mediated membrane perturbation in vitro. Results of this study provide a biochemical explanation for the pro apoptotic action of f.l. Bid.

The solution was immersed in an oil bath and allowed to stir at 50 C. for 24 h. The solution was then passed through a chromatographic column alumina Freon 113 2 5 cm . Evaporation of the solvent yielded a clear colorless viscous oil which was further purified by passage through a 0.22 m polyethersulfone filter.

In a representative curing procedure for PFPE DMA 1 wt of 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone DMPA 99 Aldrich 0.05 g 2.0 mmol was added to PFPE DMA 5 g 1.2 mmol along with 2 mL Freon 113 until a clear solution was formed. After removal of the solvent the cloudy viscous oil was passed through a 0.22 m polyethersulfone filter to remove any DMPA that did not disperse into the PFPE DMA. The filtered PFPE DMA was then irradiated with a UV source Electro Lite Corporation Danbury Conn. United States of America UV curing chamber model no. 81432 ELC 500 365 nm while under a nitrogen purge for 10 min. This resulted in a clear slightly yellow rubbery material.

In some embodiments a PFPE DMA device such as a stamp was fabricated according to the method described by Rolland J. P. et al. 2004 126 2322 2323. Briefly the PFPE DMA containing a photoinitiator such as DMPA was spin coated 800 rpm to a thickness of 20 m onto a Si wafer containing the desired photoresist pattern. This coated wafer was then placed into the UV curing chamber and irradiated for 6 seconds. Separately a thick layer about 5 mm of the material was produced by pouring the PFPE DMA containing photoinitiator into a mold surrounding the Si wafer containing the desired photoresist pattern. This wafer was irradiated with UV light for one minute. Following this the thick layer was removed. The thick layer was then placed on top of the thin layer such that the patterns in the two layers were precisely aligned and then the entire device was irradiated for 10 minutes. Once complete the entire device was peeled from the Si wafer with both layers adhered together.

5.1. Fabrication of a Perfluoropolyether Dimethacrylate PFPE DMA Mold from a Template Generated Using Electron Beam Lithography

A template or master for perfluoropolyether dimethacrylate PFPE DMA mold fabrication is generated using electron beam lithography by spin coating a bilayer resist of 200 000 MW PMMA and 900 000 MW PMMA onto a silicon wafer with 500 nm thermal oxide and exposing this resist layer to an electron beam that is translating in a pre programmed pattern. The resist is developed in 3 1 isopropanol methyl isobutyl ketone solution to remove exposed regions of the resist. A corresponding metal pattern is formed on the silicon oxide surface by evaporating 5 nm Cr and 15 nm Au onto the resist covered surface and lifting off the residual PMMA Cr Au film in refluxing acetone. This pattern is transferred to the underlying silicon oxide surface by reactive ion etching with CF Oplasma and removal of the Cr Au film in aqua regia see .

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter describes a novel top down soft lithographic technique non wetting imprint lithography NoWIL which allows completely isolated nanostructures to be generated by taking advantage of the inherent low surface energy and swelling resistance of cured PFPE based materials.

The presently described subject matter provides a novel top down soft lithographic technique non wetting imprint lithography NoWIL which allows completely isolated nanostructures to be generated by taking advantage of the inherent low surface energy and swelling resistance of cured PFPE based materials. Without being bound to any one particular theory a key aspect of NoWIL is that both the elastomeric mold and the surface underneath the drop of monomer or resin are non wetting to this droplet. If the droplet wets this surface a thin scum layer will inevitably be present even if high pressures are exerted upon the mold. When both the elastomeric mold and the surface are non wetting i.e. a PFPE mold and fluorinated surface the liquid is confined only to the features of the mold and the scum layer is eliminated as a seal forms between the elastomeric mold and the surface under a slight pressure. Thus the presently disclosed subject matter provides for the first time a simple general soft lithographic method to produce nanoparticles of nearly any material size and shape that are limited only by the original master used to generate the mold.

Using NoWIL nanoparticles composed of 3 different polymers were generated from a variety of engineered silicon masters. Representative patterns include but are not limited to 3 m arrows see conical shapes that are 500 nm at the base and converge to 

Polyethylene glycol PEG is a material of interest for drug delivery applications because it is readily available non toxic and biocompatible. The use of PEG nanoparticles generated by inverse microemulsions to be used as gene delivery vectors has previously been reported. K. McAllister et al. 124 15198 15207 Dec. 25 2002 . In the presently disclosed subject matter NoWIL was performed using a commercially available PEG diacrylate and blending it with 1 wt of a photoinitiator 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone. PFPE molds were generated from a variety of patterned silicon substrates using a dimethacrylate functionalized PFPE oligomer PFPE DMA as described previously. See J. P. Rolland E. C. Hagberg G. M. Denison K. R. Carter J. M. DeSimone 43 5796 5799 2004 . In one embodiment flat uniform non wetting surfaces were generated by using a silicon wafer treated with a fluoroalkyl trichlorosilane or by casting a film of PFPE DMA on a flat surface and photocuring. A small drop of PEG diacrylate was then placed on the non wetting surface and the patterned PFPE mold placed on top of it. The substrate was then placed in a molding apparatus and a small pressure was applied to push out the excess PEG diacrylate. The entire apparatus was then subjected to UV light 365 nm for ten minutes while under a nitrogen purge. Particles were observed after separation of the PFPE mold and flat non wetting substrate using optical microscopy scanning electron microscopy SEM and atomic force microscopy AFM .

Poly lactic acid PLA and derivatives thereof such as poly lactide co glycolide PLGA have had a considerable impact on the drug delivery and medical device communities because it is biodegradable. See K. E. Uhrich S. M. Cannizzaro R. S. Langer K. M. Shakesheff 99 3181 3198 November 1999 A. C. Albertsson I. K. Varma 4 1466 1486 November December 2003 . As with PEG based systems progress has been made toward the fabrication of PLGA particles through various dispersion techniques that result in size distributions and are strictly limited to spherical shapes. See C. Cui S. P. Schwendeman 34 8426 2001 .

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates the use of NoWIL to generate discrete PLA particles with total control over shape and size distribution. For example in one embodiment one gram of 3S cis 3 6 dimethyl 1 4 dioxane 2 5 dione was heated above its melting temperature to 110 C. and 20 L of stannous octoate catalyst initiator was added to the liquid monomer. A drop of the PLA monomer solution was then placed into a preheated molding apparatus which contained a non wetting flat substrate and mold. A small pressure was applied as previously described to push out excess PLA monomer. The apparatus was allowed to heat at 110 C. for 15 h until the polymerization was complete. The PFPE DMA mold and the flat non wetting substrate were then separated to reveal the PLA particles.

To further demonstrate the versatility of NoWIL particles composed of a conducting polymer polypyrrole PPy were generated. PPy particles have been formed using dispersion methods see M. R. Simmons P. A. Chaloner S. P. Armes 11 4222 1995 as well as lost wax techniques see P. Jiang J. F. Bertone V. L. Colvin 291 453 2001 .

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates for the first time complete control over shape and size distribution of PPy particles. Pyrrole is known to polymerize instantaneously when in contact with oxidants such as perchloric acid. Dravid et al. has shown that this polymerization can be retarded by the addition of tetrahydrofuran THF to the pyrrole. See M. Su M. Aslam L. Fu N. Q. Wu V. P. Dravid 84 4200 4202 May 24 2004 .

The presently disclosed subject matter takes advantage of this property in the formation of PPy particles by NoWIL. For example 50 L of a 1 1 v v solution of THF pyrrole was added to 50 L of 70 perchloric acid. A drop of this clear brown solution prior to complete polymerization into the molding apparatus and applied pressure to remove excess solution. The apparatus was then placed into the vacuum oven overnight to remove the THF and water. PPy particles were fabricated with good fidelity using the same masters as previously described.

Importantly the materials properties and polymerization mechanisms of PLA PEG and PPy are completely different. For example while PLA is a high modulus semicrystalline polymer formed using a metal catalyzed ring opening polymerization at high temperature PEG is a malleable waxy solid that is photocured free radically and PPy is a conducting polymer polymerized using harsh oxidants. The fact that NoWIL can be used to fabricate particles from these diverse classes of polymeric materials that require very different reaction conditions underscores its generality and importance.

In addition to its ability to precisely control the size and shape of particles NoWIL offers tremendous opportunities for the facile encapsulation of agents into nanoparticles. As described in Example 3 14 NoWIL can be used to encapsulate a 24 mer DNA strand fluorescently tagged with CY 3 inside the previously described 200 nm trapezoidal PEG particles. This was accomplished by simply adding the DNA to the monomer water solution and molding them as described. We were able to confirm the encapsulation by observing the particles using confocal fluorescence microscopy see . The presently described approach offers a distinct advantage over other encapsulation methods in that no surfactants condensation agents and the like are required. Furthermore the fabrication of monodisperse 200 nm particles containing DNA represents a breakthrough step towards artificial viruses. Accordingly a host of biologically important agents such as gene fragments pharmaceuticals oligonucleotides and viruses can be encapsulated by this method.

The method also is amenable to non biologically oriented agents such as metal nanoparticles crystals or catalysts. Further the simplicity of this system allows for straightforward adjustment of particle properties such as crosslink density charge and composition by the addition of other comonomers and combinatorial generation of particle formulations that can be tailored for specific applications.

Accordingly NoWIL is a highly versatile method for the production of isolated discrete nanostructures of nearly any size and shape. The shapes presented herein were engineered non arbitrary shapes. NoWIL can easily be used to mold and replicate non engineered shapes found in nature such as viruses crystals proteins and the like. Furthermore the technique can generate particles from a wide variety of organic and inorganic materials containing nearly any cargo. The method is simplistically elegant in that it does not involve complex surfactants or reaction conditions to generate nanoparticles. Finally the process can be amplified to an industrial scale by using existing soft lithography roller technology see Y. N. Xia D. Qin G. M. Whitesides 8 1015 1017 December 1996 or silk screen printing methods.

The telechelic PFPE precursor was UV polymerized under a blanket of nitrogen into a cross linked rubber the mold . The mold was then peeled away from the master revealing 200 200 200 nm patterned cavities in the mold. 1 part trimethylolpropane triacrylate containing 10 DEAP triacrylate resin was then dissolved in 10 parts methanol and spray coated onto the patterned side of the mold until full coverage was achieved. A thin polyethylene sheet was placed over the patterned side of the mold and sealed to the mold by manually applying a small amount of pressure. The polyethylene sheet was then slowly peeled away from the mold 1 mm sec allowing capillary filling of the cavities in the mold. Excess triacrylate resin was gathered at the PFPE polyethylene interface and removed from the mold as the polyethylene sheet was peeled away. Once the polyethylene sheet was fully peeled away from the mold any residual macroscopic droplets of triacrylate resin were removed from the mold. The triacrylate resin filling the patterned cavities in the mold was then UV polymerized under a blanket of nitrogen for about 5 minutes. Collodion solution Fisher Scientific was then spin cast onto the patterned side of the mold to produce a robust nitrocellulose based film. This film was then peeled away from the mold to remove particles by adhesive transfer to the nitrocellulose film. The nitrocellulose film was then dissolved in acetone. The particles were purified from the dissolved nitrocellulose by a repetitive process of sedimenting the particles decanting nitrocellulose acetone solution and resuspension of the particles in clean acetone. This process was repeated until all the nitrocellulose was separated from the particles.
