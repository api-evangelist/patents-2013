title: Efficient SQL based multi-attribute clustering
abstract: Efficient SQL based multi-attribute clustering of data attributes may be used to identify the most relevant combination of data attributes to an outcome. A global outcome value may be calculated to represent an average of the outcome. A subset outcome value for each subset of data attributes of a plurality of attributes may be calculated to represent average of the outcome for the subset. For each subset of data attributes, a number of members associated with the subset may be compared to a threshold, and the subsets with less members than the threshold may be removed. The subset outcome value for each subset of data attributes may be compared to the global outcome value, and a report may be generated that identifies each subset for which the corresponding subset outcome value is greater than or less than the global outcome value.

Most corporations including health insurance corporations maintain a high volume of data. Such data may be analyzed and exploited for valuable information regarding business trends and other important statistics. Data mining is a common strategy for identifying and analyzing such data.

There are many forms of data mining. For example custom analytic operations may be developed to meet specific needs. Alternatively commercially available statistical analysis tools such as Statistical Analysis Software SAS may be used to identify statistical trends in data.

Health insurance companies may maintain databases of health insurance claim information demographic information and other data about health insurance plan members. Such information may provide valuable insights into disease causes progressions and potential cures. Unfortunately typical methods for analyzing such data are often cumbersome costly and require unworkably high processing times and resources.

For example conventional methods for identifying relationships between independent and dependent variables are limited to specific combinations of variables such as pairs or triples or higher order combinations of variables. That is a user must manually identify variables that are important and request a software package to calculate statistics for those combinations of variables. A user is unable to identify unknown statistically relevant combinations of variables in this manner.

Furthermore in conventional systems intervals with an abundance of useful data are masked by surrounding regions of intervals with little useful data. As a consequence the most relevant and useful data is not identified in conventional systems. Because the data and identified relationships are commonly used as inputs in predictive regressive models the predictions yielded by these conventional predictive models are sub optimal.

The referenced shortcomings are not intended to be exhaustive but rather are among many that tend to impair the effectiveness of previously known techniques of disease management however those mentioned here are sufficient to demonstrate that the methodologies appearing in the art have not been satisfactory and that a significant need exists for the techniques described and claimed in this disclosure.

This disclosure presents systems and methods for efficient multi attribute clustering which may be executed in a Structured Query Language SQL . For example a system and method is disclosed that using SQL technology may identify the most relevant and useful data attribute clusters that contribute to an outcome such as a health condition diagnosis or healthcare cost. Multi attribute clustering may allow better modeling and detection in disease scenarios where multiple attributes contribute to a disease. Multi attribute clustering may also allow the multi attribute clusters to be efficiently identified using parallel computing. With the most relevant and useful multi attribute clusters identified the present disclosure allows predictive models using the multi attribute clusters as inputs to yield optimal and previously unknown predictions and relationships.

For example three commonly prescribed drugs may include X Y and Z. Taken independently or in any paired combination the drugs may be safe. However in a cluster of patients taking all three drugs concurrently a rate of adverse events may be high. Multi attribute clustering allows identifying this combination of drugs with adverse effects without first requiring identification of the drugs in a possible hypothesis regarding the combination of drugs X Y and Z.

In one embodiment a method may include calculating a global outcome value wherein the global outcome value may represent an average of the outcome for a plurality of members. The method may also include calculating in parallel a subset outcome value for each subset of data attributes of a plurality of data attributes. Each subset of data attributes may include a unique combination of at least one data attribute of a plurality of data attributes and each of the plurality of data attributes may be associated with a plurality of members. The subset outcome value may also represent an average of the outcome for members that are associated with each data attribute of the subset of data attributes.

In certain embodiments the method may further include comparing for each subset of data attributes a number of members associated with the subset of data attributes with a threshold and removing each subset of data attributes for which the number of members associated with the subset is below the threshold. The method may also include comparing for each subset of data attributes the subset outcome value for the subset with the global outcome value and generating a report that identifies each subset of data attributes for which the corresponding subset outcome value is greater by a first threshold than or less by a second threshold than the global outcome value.

In another embodiment the method may be implemented using a database query language such as SQL the plurality of members may include at least one of a plurality of persons and a plurality of healthcare providers and each subset of data attributes identified in the generated report may be input into a regression model to create a predictive model the threshold may be user defined and or the threshold may be algorithmically defined and dynamically adjusted.

Systems for efficient multi attribute clustering are also disclosed. In one embodiment the system may include a data storage device configured to store a plurality of data records for a plurality of members wherein each data record includes a plurality of data attributes. The system may also include a processor in data communication with the data storage device that is configured to calculate a global outcome value wherein the global outcome value represents an average of the outcome for a plurality of members and to calculate in parallel a subset outcome value for each subset of data attributes of a plurality of data attributes.

According to one embodiment the processor may be further configured to compare for each subset of data attributes a number of members associated with the subset of data attributes with a threshold and to remove each subset of data attributes for which the number of members associated with the subset is below the threshold. The processor may also be configured to compare for each subset of data attributes the subset outcome value for the subset with the global outcome value and to generate a report that identifies each subset of data attributes for which the corresponding subset outcome value is greater than or less than the global outcome value. In one embodiment the processor is in data communication with the data storage device using a database query language such as SQL.

In another embodiment computer program products having a non transitory computer readable medium with computer executable instructions are presented. In one embodiment the computer executable instructions perform the operations of calculating a global outcome value wherein the global outcome value represents an average of the outcome for a plurality of members and calculating in parallel a subset outcome value for each subset of data attributes of a plurality of data attributes.

According to an embodiment the computer executable instructions may also perform the operations of comparing for each subset of data attributes a number of members associated with the subset of data attributes with a threshold and removing each subset of data attributes for which the number of members associated with the subset is below the threshold. The computer executable instructions may also perform the operations of comparing for each subset of data attributes the subset outcome value for the subset with the global outcome value and generating a report that identifies each subset of data attributes for which the corresponding subset outcome value is greater than or less than the global outcome value. In certain embodiments the computer executable instructions may be written in a database query language such as SQL.

Other features and associated advantages could become apparent with reference to the following detailed description of specific embodiments in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Various features and advantageous details are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known starting materials processing techniques components and equipment are omitted so as not to unnecessarily obscure the invention in detail. It should be understood however that the detailed description and the specific examples while indicating embodiments of the invention are given by way of illustration only and not by way of limitation. Various substitutions modifications additions and or rearrangements within the spirit and or scope of the underlying inventive concept could become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.

Certain units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. A module is a self contained hardware or software component that interacts with a larger system. Alan Freedman The Computer Glossary 268 8th ed. 1998 . A module comprises a component of a machine a machine or a plurality of machines that are suitably programmed to operate according to executable instructions. For example a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices a controller or the like.

Modules may also include software defined units or instructions that when executed by a processing machine or device retrieve and transform data stored on a data storage device from a first state to a second state. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical blocks of computer instructions which may be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and when executed by the processor achieve the stated data transformation.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices.

For example a web application for multi attribute clustering may access a first web service for calculating a global outcome value and a second web service for calculating in parallel a subset outcome value for each subset of data attributes. The web services may compare for each subset of data attributes a number of members associated with the subset of data attributes with a threshold and may remove each subset of data attributes for which the number of members associated with the subset of data attributes is below the threshold. The web services may also compare for each subset of data attributes the subset outcome value for the subset of data attributes with the global outcome value. In response the web service may return a report associated with the attributes or profile statistics graphs or the like.

In one embodiment these modules may include a calculate outcome value module a compare subset size module a remove subset module and a compare outcome value module .

In certain embodiments an outcome may include a diagnosis code associated with a condition a healthcare cost or the like. The condition may be a specific condition or a combination of multiple conditions. For example the condition may be a short term disability a long term disability a permanent disability a disease a co morbidity condition a health related condition a retirement or a combination thereof. Such a disease may include any disease known to persons of ordinary skill in the art such as a neoplasm.

Data attributes may in certain circumstances include a plurality of attributes.

In such an embodiment the attribute would include the disability condition and a related time frame such as a median life expectancy of the cancer. In such an example the group of records may include all large intestine cancer patients with information within the specified time frame of cancer onset or initial diagnosis which could be either an ICD9 code or a lab reading or both . In certain embodiments a timestamp may be used to identify data attribute patterns over time.

Although the various functions of the server and the CPU are described in the context of modules the methods processes and software described herein are not limited to a modular structure.

Alternatively the functions may be implemented in software coded in C C C php Java or the like. In still another embodiment the functions may be implemented in web based instructions including HTML XML etc.

Generally the interface module may receive inputs and display outputs such as reports graphs statistics or the like. For example the interface module may receive one or more attributes.

The interface module may further include I O ports pins pads wires buses and the like for facilitating communications between the processor and the various adapters and interface components . The interface module may also include software defined components for interfacing with other software modules on the CPU .

In a specific embodiment the CPU may load and execute computer software configured to generate retrieve send or otherwise operate SQL instructions. For example the calculate outcome value module may communicate an SQL query to the data storage device which is configured to calculate global outcome values. A global outcome value may be associated with a single data attribute or a plurality of data attributes and may represent the average of the outcome for a plurality of members. The outcome may be any result for which an analysis may be sought to identify data attributes that contribute to the result. For example in one embodiment the outcome may be the overall healthcare cost incurred by an individual and the global outcome value may be X where X is the average healthcare cost for all the members for which healthcare cost data is available.

The calculate outcome value module may also be configured to calculate a subset outcome value for each subset of data attributes of a plurality of data attributes. Each subset of data attributes may include a unique combination of at least one data attribute of a plurality of data attributes. Any combination of data attributes that is redundant and therefore not unique regardless of the order in which the data attributes are grouped in a subset of data attributes is removed from any further processing of the subsets. A subset of data attributes may include any number of data attributes. Therefore in one embodiment a subset of data attributes may include one data attribute while in another embodiment a subset of data attributes may include at least two data attributes.

The subset outcome value may be associated with a single data attribute or a plurality of data attributes and may represent the average of the outcome for members that are associated with each data attribute of the subset of data attributes. As an example the subset of data attributes may include a data attribute specifying individuals between the age of 19 and 24 a data attribute specifying individuals living in Rhode Island and a data attribute specifying individuals living in a multi family dwelling. Taken together this subset of attributes will be associated with all members who are between the age of 19 and 24 and who live in a multifamily dwelling in Rhode Island. Continuing with the previous example in which the outcome is the overall healthcare cost incurred by an individual the calculated subset outcome value for this subset of members may be Y. Therefore the average healthcare cost incurred by all members between the age of 19 and 24 and that live in a multi family dwelling in Rhode Island is for example Y.

In another embodiment the subset of data attributes may identify a group of members having records with data attributes that include a specified ICD 9 diagnosis code and a demographic feature corresponding to the member s profile. For example the subset of data attributes may specify individuals associated with a specific diagnosis and certain age ranges gender residence and or comorbidity.

The calculate outcome value module may be configured to calculate a subset outcome value for each subset in parallel. For example the calculate outcome value module may utilize a database query language such as a SQL to control the calculation of each subset of data attributes. SQL queries may cause the calculation of the subset outcome values to be performed in parallel.

In one embodiment the compare subset size module may be configured to compare for each subset of data attributes a number of members associated with the subset of data attributes with a threshold. The threshold may be user defined or may be calculated and defined based on an algorithm. According to one embodiment a threshold based on an algorithm may be dynamically adjusted. The threshold may specify the minimum number of members that may be associated with a subset of data attributes. If the number of members associated with the subset of data attributes is below the threshold the subset is removed from further processing of the subsets. For example in one embodiment the remove subset module may be configured to remove each subset of data attributes for which the number of members associated with the subset is below the threshold.

By setting a minimum number of members that must be associated with a subset of attributes and removing those subsets for which the number of associated members is below the threshold the possibility of having insignificant subsets of data attributes appear significant is reduced. For example even though a subset of data attributes for which three members are associated may yield a significantly high or low subset outcome value the subset is not as relevant to the outcome as a subset of data attributes that yields a smaller or higher subset outcome value but includes a larger number of members. Data processed by the compare subset size module and the remove subset module ensure that only the most relevant subsets of data attributes are considered and identified in the subsequent report.

The compare outcome value module may be configured to compare for each subset of data attributes the subset outcome value for the subset with the global outcome value and to generate a report that identifies each subset of data attributes for which the corresponding subset outcome value is greater than or less than the global outcome value. In certain embodiments statistical methods may also be used to identify the subsets of data attributes that have corresponding subset outcome values greater than or less than the global outcome value. Using the example previously discussed the compare outcome value module may compare Y to X. If Y is greater than X by a first threshold e.g. if the average healthcare cost incurred by all members between the age of 19 and 24 and that live in a multi family dwelling in Rhode Island is greater than the average healthcare cost for all the members for which healthcare cost data is available then the subset of data attributes for which the subset outcome value is Y may be a strong indicator of data attributes that increase the cost of healthcare. That is the multi attribute cluster that includes members between the age of 19 and 24 that live in Rhode Island and that live in a multifamily dwelling may be a multi attribute cluster that yields a strong indication of high healthcare costs. However if after Y is compared to X it is determined that Y is less than X by a second threshold then the subset of data attributes for which the subset outcome value is Y may be a strong indicator of data attributes that reduce the cost of healthcare. The first threshold and the second threshold may be adjusted by the user or adjusted dynamically to select particular subsets that are statistically meaningful. For example the first threshold and the second threshold may be set such that subsets that are one standard deviation from the global outcome value are selected. Multi attribute clusters identified as described above may be input to a predictive model to obtain predictions based on the data attributes such as healthcare expenditure.

The report generated by the compare outcome value module may identify each subset of data attributes for which the corresponding subset outcome value is greater than or less than the global outcome value. The report may be output in a variety of ways. For example the report may be output using the interface module as a list of all subsets greater than or less than the global outcome value. The report may be a graph or numerical statistic illustrating which multi attribute clusters e.g. the subsets of data attributes with an associated subset outcome value greater than or less than the global outcome value yield high or low subset outcome values. The report may illustrate the relationship of all the data attributes that contribute to a high number of subsets. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that numerous alternative outputs may be presented using the results of the compare outcome module without departing from the disclosure in spirit or scope. According to one embodiment each subset of data attributes identified in the generated report may be provided as input to a regression model to create an optimal predictive model.

In one embodiment the threshold may be user defined while in another embodiment the threshold may be algorithmically defined and dynamically adjusted. For example the threshold may be adjusted based on the number of members with each data attribute of the subset of data attributes. When only a few patients with the data attributes exist the threshold may be reduced because a smaller number of members matching the subset of data attributes is required for the result to be statistically significant. That is if ten members have data attribute A ten members have data attribute B and ten members have data attribute C then a threshold of five may be set. But if one hundred members have data attribute A one hundred members have data attribute B and one hundred members have data attribute C then a threshold of fifty may be set. In another embodiment the threshold may be set according to a statistical significance test.

According to an embodiment the method may compare for each subset of data attributes a subset outcome value for the subset with the global outcome value at block . The method may also at block include generating a report that identifies each subset of data attributes for which the corresponding subset outcome value is greater than or less than the global outcome value. Additional reports may include ranges and trends for treatment patterns and costs as well as statistics including averages probabilities and other computational products.

In another embodiment the method may be implemented using a database query language such as SQL. In certain embodiments of the disclosure the plurality of members may include at least one of a plurality of persons and a plurality of healthcare providers and each subset of data attributes identified in the generated report may be input into a regression model to create a predictive model.

The method may be repeated for different orders of comparisons. For example the method may be first performed for sets of two data attributes to generate interesting clusters of data attributes in which the cluster meets a threshold size. The method may then be repeated for sets of three data attributes to generate interesting clusters of data attributes in which the cluster meets a threshold size. The method may further be repeated for higher orders of data attributes. Clusters from each repetition of permutations may be stored and combined in a single report.

Parallelization of subset outcome values at block may improve performance of the method and improve the capability of finding subsets of data attributes that have meaningful outcomes. Conventionally comparison of a large number of subsets of data attributes is time consuming. For large sets of data attributes it may be difficult to identify relevant subsets of the data attributes. illustrates one embodiment of a method for parallel calculation of outcome values for subsets of data attributes. In one embodiment the parallelization is performed within a server.

The method begins at block with performing pairwise comparisons of subsets data attributes. To reduce a number of calculations performed at block redundant subsets of data attributes may be skipped. For example when a subset of data attributes includes A and B a future subset of data attributes including B and A may be skipped. At block comparisons resulting in an outcome value below are threshold are removed because the comparisons yielded uninteresting or statistically insignificant results. For example when the number of patients with a particular subset of data attributes is too small that subset of data attributes may be removed from further clustering calculations. At block the method re permutates pairwise combinations and returns to block to repeat the method . When coded in SQL the method may be executed using nested inline views that feed other views to simulate program flow with filters at appropriate stages.

By identifying subsets of data attributes with high outcome values data attributes of a patient that cluster prior to a disease s onset may be identified. The healthcare professionals responsible for that patient may be notified of the clustering of data attributes for the patient. The healthcare professionals may intervene to prevent progression of the disease or intervene while the disease is in early stages. Identified subsets of data attributes with high outcome values may also be useful in estimating the response for a patient to a particular treatment. The patient s healthcare professionals may be provided with information that the patient has a cluster of data attributes that suggest a particular result if a certain treatment is provided. Thus the healthcare professionals may be provided advance information based on the statistical methods described above which treatments may be beneficial and which treatments are likely to have adverse outcomes.
