A wide variety of media devices are available for users to consume an ever growing selection of content. These media devices may include televisions tablet computers personal computers electronic book eBook readers gaming consoles set top boxes media players in vehicle entertainment systems portable media players smartphones and so forth. The content presented by these media devices may include audio video eBooks games applications and so forth. The content may be downloaded or streamed from a content provider to the media device.

Users may access the content from the different media devices over time. Placing restrictions on access by particular users may be beneficial. For example parents may wish to limit how much time a child spends accessing content.

Certain implementations and embodiments will now be described more fully below with reference to the accompanying figures in which various aspects are shown. However various aspects may be implemented in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

A user may access content such as audio video electronic books eBooks games and so forth with one or more media devices. These media devices may include televisions tablet computers personal computers eBook readers gaming consoles set top boxes media players in vehicle entertainment systems portable media players smartphones and so forth. Access to the content may include receiving a stream of content retrieving previously stored data interaction with an external device such as a server and so forth.

The increasing availability and type of content combined with the increasingly common presence of media devices may result in situations where placing some limits on access to the content may be beneficial. For example a parent may wish to set time limits for a child which limit the time spent playing game applications time spent watching movies and so forth.

A system for providing content access control across multiple media devices is described. This system allows for the implementation of access controls associated with a specific user regardless of what media device the user accesses the content with. For example the parent of user Chris may have set content access limits which restrict access to content with a content category of entertainment to 45 minutes per day. Regardless of whether the user Chris accesses content from a smart phone tablet notebook computer or television the content access limit is enforced.

Content access data associated with the user is acquired. The content access data is information which describes content access by the user. The content access data may include data indicative of amount of time the content has been accessed cost associated with access of the content category type of the content and so forth. The content access data may be received from media devices content servers or other devices associated with providing or supporting access to the content.

The content access limits specify constraints to access associated with a particular user or group of users. These access limits may be based on one or more of time content category cost and so forth. Time limits may be based on time of day time used and so forth. These constraints when reached may result in access being disallowed degraded and so forth. Continuing the example the parent may have specified that user Chris is not allowed to access any content between 10 00 p.m. and 6 00 a.m. local time.

One or more of the content access limits may be modified by one or more conditions. These conditions may include a particular elapsed time period date or time access by the user to predetermined content presence of the user at a predetermined location and so forth. For example the limit on the content category entertainment may be increased by 10 minutes for every 30 minutes educational content is accessed.

By providing access limits which affect the user across different media devices limits may be implemented in a consistent and comprehensive fashion. The access limits may be configured using web interfaces application programming interfaces from other systems and so forth.

Several users . . . U are depicted with several media devices . . . D . The media devices are configured to present store manipulate or otherwise participate in the access of content . The media devices may include televisions tablet computers personal computers electronic book eBook readers gaming consoles set top boxes media players in vehicle entertainment systems portable media players smartphones and so forth.

The media devices may execute on or more modules. These modules may be configured to interact with the content by receiving and processing the content for presentation generating a stream of the content for presentation providing various functionality executing an application processing a script and so forth. The media devices are discussed below in more detail with regard to . The content may include audio video eBooks applications games and so forth.

The media device may also include a client control module . The client control module is configured to support the content access control and is described below in more detail. The client control module may be configured to request or receive data indicating that access to content is restricted. In some implementations the client control module may be configured to generate content access data . The content access data provides information indicative of access by the user to content with the media device . The content access data may also include data indicative of amount of time the content has been accessed cost associated with access of the content category type of the content and so forth. The content access data is discussed in more detail below with regard to .

The media device is configured to connect to one or more networks . The one or more networks may include one or more local area networks public networks such as the Internet private networks cellular data networks or a combination thereof. The network may in turn couple to one or more content servers . . . S . The content servers may exchange information with the one or more media devices . While the content servers are depicted as single servers in some implementations the content servers or the functions attributed to the content servers may be provided by a plurality of devices. For example the content server may be implemented as a virtualized server executing across a plurality of physical servers. Likewise other servers may be similarly configured.

The content server may include a content distribution module . The content distribution module is configured to provide content to the one or more media devices or other devices. The content distribution module may be configured to send content such as by streaming transfer content files and so forth. In some implementations the content distribution module may be configured to authorize authenticate validate or otherwise enable operation of the content . For example the content may include an executable application which requires confirmation of licensing with the content server prior to execution. The content distribution module may be configured to generate the content access data . The content access data may be generated from user requests for content to stream information about applications authorized information based on license key authentication and so forth.

An access control interface module is also depicted in the content server . The access control interface module is configured to couple to the content access control server . The content server is configured to request receive or request and receive information indicative of whether the user is allowed access to the content provided by the content server . The action of the access control interface module is discussed in more detail below with regard to .

Also coupled to the network is the content access control server . As described above the network enables the media device the content server the content access control server and other devices to exchange information with one another.

The content access control server is configured to acquire content access data and determine whether a particular user is permitted to access content . The content access control server may acquire the data using a data acquisition module . The data acquisition module may receive data sent from the media devices the content servers or other devices. For example the client control module may be configured to generate content access data for activities taking place on the media device such as the user playing a game application. In another example the content server may send content access data generated from transactions occurring on the content server .

An interface module in the content access control server is configured to provide one or more interfaces between the content access control server and other devices or services. The interface module may be configured to provide a user interface to the users through the media devices . The user interface may be used to configure limits. For example the user interface may comprise a web page.

Administration of limits associated with a user may be permitted from any of the media devices or may be restricted to a particular media device . For example a parent user may configure the content access control server to permit changes to limits when made from the particular media device but disregard change requests from other media devices such as and so forth. This feature may be used to provide additional security to the limits because the child users and so forth must have physical access to the media device to change their access limits.

The interface module may provide an application programming interface API . For example the content server may use the API of the interface module to provide content access data to the content server or the media device request information about a user and so forth.

A content access control module accepts as inputs at least a portion of the content access data and at least one or more content access limits . The content access limits comprise information which defines constraints on a particular user or group of users access to content . The content access limits are discussed in more detail below with regard to . The content access control module is configured to determine a content access status for the user .

The content access status provides information indicative of whether a particular user is permitted to access the content . The content access status may be specific to a particular piece of content a particular content category or other attributes associated with the content . For example the user may be permitted time limited access to content with the content category of entertainment while access to content in the educational content category is unlimited but restricted to times other than 10 00 p.m. to 6 00 a.m. The content access status is discussed in more detail below with regard to .

In some implementations the content access control module may be configured to modify one or more of the content access limits based at least in part on the content access data . For example the content access control server may be configured to incentivize consumption of educational content by increasing the time allocated for consumption of entertainment content when educational content is accessed. Continuing the example reading an educational eBook for 30 minutes may result in the user gaining 10 minutes of entertainment time which may be used to play a game application.

When the content access limits for a particular user are reached the access to the content may be prevented suspended or degraded. Prevention may be used when the user requests content but has previously reached one or more of the content access limits . For example the user may have no more time left for the content category of entertainment and so presentation of a cartoon may be denied. Suspension of access may occur while the content is currently being accessed but one or more of the content access limits for that user have been reached. For example playback of the cartoon is paused or stopped and the user cannot resume playback until the content access limits permit. Degradation of content may be used to discourage further access to content without abruptly stopping access. For example presentation of audio or video may be made at a lower resolution application execution may be slowed additional latencies may be introduced into interaction and so forth.

In these illustrations the content access control server is described as maintaining the content access data across the media devices . In other implementations the content access data for the user may be distributed across a plurality of devices. For example the content access data at the content access control server may include information on usage from the content servers and the media devices but may omit the content access data from the media device . In addition to or instead of the content access status the content access data or a summary or extract thereof maybe provided to the client control module executing on the media device . The client control module may then be configured to make the determination based on one or more of the locally stored content access data the content access data received from the content access control server the received content access status or other data.

The content access data may include a device identifier device ID . The device identifier provides information which is indicative of a particular device which is involved in the access of the content . For example the device identifier may include a serial number or media access control MAC address for the media device of the content server and so forth.

A user identifier user ID provides information indicative of a particular user . For example the user ID may be a login name serial number biometric identifier and so forth.

The content access data may include a content identifier . The content identifier provides information indicative of a particular piece of content . This may include a title serial number content server identification string access code hyperlink web address and so forth.

Time and cost data associated with access to the content may also be stored. In one implementation the time may include total time elapsed for access to the content . The cost provides information associated with the cost in terms of currency points and so forth which has been used to access the content . In some implementations the content access data may include content category information such as described below.

The content access data may provide a comprehensive set of information about the access to content . For example as illustrated here the media device was used by user to play the game Upset Cats for 33 minutes which cost 3.00.

In some implementations the content access data may be compiled from several different sources. For example the time and cost data may be acquired from the content server while the user ID may be retrieved from the media device .

As described above the content access limits comprise information which defines constraints on a particular user or group of users access to content . These constraints may be defined in terms of time cost location media device used to access proximity of other users and so forth.

The content access limits depicted here include the user ID . The user ID allows a particular constraint to be applied to a particular user . In some implementations the constraints may be applied to a group of users . In such implementations a group ID may be used instead of a user ID .

Information about a content category or other attribute may be stored. The content category data is used to provide finer grain control over the content . The content category may be manually or automatically designated. For example a human operator may specify during intake of content to the content server that the content is associated with one or more content categories . The content categories may include games eBooks video games entertainment educational and so forth. The content categories may also designate the type of content such as eBooks or video. The content categories may also designate what is in the content such as entertainment or educational. In some implementations additional attributes may be used to specify content access limits . For example videos or games may be limited based on ratings data provided by ratings organizations such as the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA or the Entertainment Software Rating Board ESRB .

Time limits or other time based constraints may be specified in the content access limits . For example as illustrated here the user is limited to 60 minutes per week of content which is in the content category of games . Other time based constraints may also be specified such as particular hours days of the week and so forth during which access to content is either permitted or disallowed.

Cost limits may also be specified. For example the user is limited to incurring a cost of 5 per week for accessing content which is in the games content category . As shown the content access limits may thus specify one or more of a maximum time limit a maximum cost limit content category and so forth.

Other limits may also be provided. For example physical geographic location limits may be used to further specify constraints. For example content with an MPAA rating of R may be disallowed while the media device is used by the user on school grounds.

The content access limits may also include blacklists or whitelists. The blacklists may specify content which is never permitted to be accessed by the user . In comparison the whitelists may specify content which is approved for access by the user . In some implementations the blacklists or whitelists may override the other constraints. For example even if the user has plenty of time available to play a game the blacklist may prevent any access to the game Upset Cats .

The constraints defined in the content access limits may be modified by one or more conditions. The conditions are configured to initiate modification of the content access limits based on an event or input. The modification may include adding or subtracting from the time limit cost limits and so forth. The conditions may include an elapsed time period particular date or time access by the user to predetermined content presence of the user at a predetermined physical location input from a third party such as academic test results from a school and so forth. For example the content access control server may receive data from a school and when the student user earns a grade above a threshold set by the parent user additional time may be added to the time limit for the content category of games for the student user . In another example for every 30 minutes of access by the student user of an eBook with the content category of educational the time limit for the content category of games may be increased by 10 minutes.

The conditions to modify the constraints may be configured to allow accrual of time cost or other parameters. For example the content access limits may be configured to allow the user to save or accumulate time limit for the content category of games allowing time which is unused to roll into a next time period such as the next week. These constraints may be capped at a maximum allowed time cost and so forth.

The content access status is configured to provide information indicative of whether a particular user is permitted to access the content . The content access status may be specific to a particular piece of content a particular content category particular type of content such as audio video eBook application or other attributes associated with the content . The content access status may be expressed as a single bit value such as yes or no for all access or as a more detailed expression indicating the content access status for a plurality of different content categories or other designations.

In one implementation illustrated here the content access status includes the user ID and a status . The status in this implementation is binary indicating whether access is allowed or disallowed. In this illustration status is provided for two content categories of educational and games . As shown here the user is allowed to access both educational and games the user is disallowed to access educational but allowed to access games and the user is disallowed to access both educational and games . The content access status may include information about how much time cost and so forth is available before access is denied. For example the status for the user shows that games are allowed but have 27 minutes remaining as of the time of the content access status before being disallowed.

The content access status may also include other data. In one implementation an expiration condition for which that content access status is deemed valid may be provided. The expiration condition may determine whether the content access status is deemed valid for use or invalid and an updated content access status is to be requested. The expiration condition may include specific date or time total of minutes of content accessed and so forth.

In some implementations the content access status is distinct from other access rights permissions credentials and so forth which may be associated with the content . Furthermore the content access status may operate independently of the content access limits . For example the user is unable to access content for which they lack the digital rights management credentials regardless of whether the content access limits allow presentation of that content .

The content access data the content access limits and the content access status are depicted as tables. However other data structures may be used. Furthermore the same table or data structure may be used to store the data described or the data may be distributed across different data structures in other configurations.

A header section of the user interface provides information such as the identity of the user currently logged into the user interface the identity of the media device used and so forth. For example the user named Ward Huxtable is currently logged in from the media device . As described above in some implementations administrative functions may be locked to a particular media device . This may provide an additional layer of security to avoid unwanted changes to the content access limits . For example the parent user may use this function to restrict administrative access to the particular media device such as user s personal smartphone.

A user detail section provides information about the content access limits . For example as shown here the content category time limit cost limit and so forth may be presented. Usage may also be presented such as time used amount paid and so forth. This information may be useful to the user to see current status such as whether they are close to approaching a limit or have already been locked out. In some implementations the content access status may also be presented. The usage data may be reset or updated to correspond to conditions associated with the content access limits . For example where the content access limits are for a set number of minutes each day the time used may be reset to zero at the start of a new day.

The user may use the user interface to add remove change or otherwise modify the content access limits . For example an edit control may be presented which when activated allows the user to change one or more of the content access limits or a portion thereof.

The I O interface s may couple to one or more I O devices . The I O devices may include input devices such as one or more of a camera keyboard a microphone fingerprint sensor a touch sensor a button radio frequency identification reader near field communication receiver security token reader and so forth. The I O devices may also include output devices such as one or more of a display audio speakers haptic output device projector and so forth. In some embodiments the I O devices may be physically incorporated with the media device or may be externally placed.

In another implementation the content access control server may push or send the content access status to the media devices without request.

The client control module may be configured to generate content access data . For example the client control module may be equipped to examine system logs or other usage data generated by the OS module or other modules to generate the content access data .

The client control module may also be configured to interface with the OS module to allow or disallow execution of content such as applications. For example upon receiving a command to execute a game application the OS module may request the current content access status from the client control module . The client control module may either retrieve locally stored or determined content access status or may request the content access status maintained by the content access control server .

In some implementations the client control module may be configured with an offline mode for use when the content access control server is unavailable. The offline mode may use a last known content access status . For example the last known content access status may indicate the user is permitted another 45 minutes of access to the content . After 45 minutes of use in the offline mode further access may be denied.

In offline mode the last known content access status may be used in conjunction with locally stored content access limits . For example the last known content access status may indicate that access is allowed but may or may not include data about how much access is permitted. The locally stored content access limits may indicate a time limit of 45 minutes. Where the amount of time used is not known the locally stored content access limits may be used to cap access on the particular offline media device to 45 minutes.

In another implementation the offline mode may provide limited access to the content or may degrade the access to the content . For example the client control module may be configured to instruct the OS module to lower a display frame rate of the application to one half normal operating value.

The client control module may also be configured to work in conjunction with a content presentation module to allow or deny access to the content . The content presentation module is configured to present the content to the user . For example the content presentation module may be configured to play an audio file video file or present still images which have been previously stored or which are streamed from another device such as the content server .

In one implementation the client control module may be configured to limit access to the content presentation module . For example when content access limits have been reached the client control module may prevent the content presentation module from executing.

In another implementation the client control module may be configured to work in conjunction with the content server to allow or deny access. For example the client control module may receive data indicative of a request from the content presentation module made to the content server for the presentation of content .

The interface module may be configured to provide a user interface such as that described in to the users through the media devices . The user interface may be used to configure the content access limits and the conditions associated with those limits. In one implementation the user interface may comprise a web page.

The interface module may be configured to provide an API. For example the content server may use the API of the interface module to receive the content access data respond to requests for content access status about the user and so forth.

The memory may also store the content access control module . As described above the content access control module is configured to accept as inputs at least a portion of the content access data and at least one or more content access limits . Based at least in part on these inputs the content access control module generates the content access status . The content access status may then be used by the media device the content server or other devices to allow or disallow access to the content .

The content access control module may be configured to use the content access data to enforce the constraints in the content access limits based on concurrent usage against real time or strict serial usage. For example the user may access two pieces of content simultaneously resulting in concurrent usage. Continuing the example an eBook may be open for reading for 15 minutes while a video is playing for the same 15 minutes. The content access control module may be configured to count this as either concurrent usage such that total consumption is 15 minutes or as strict serial usage of 30 minutes. In other implementations other distribution of timing for concurrent consumption may be used.

In another implementation the content server which is providing content to the media device may have sent the content access data .

At the user is identified at a second media device . For example the user may be using the media devices and concurrently or may have switched from one media devie to another.

At the content access control server receives second content access data associated with the second media device . As described above this information may be provided by several implementations.

At the content access control server determines a total content access time cost or other metric associated with the user based at least in part on the first content access data and the second content access data . For example the content access control server may determine the time used for the user as 45 minutes. In another example the content access control server may determine the cost is 3.50.

At based on reaching or exceeding one or more of the content access limits associated with the user the content access control server sets the content access status associated with the user to disallowed. Once disallowed access to the content may be disallowed discontinued degraded and so forth as described above.

At the content access control server receives the content access data associated with the user . The content access data may be associated with the user and a plurality of the media devices . For example as shown here the content access data indicates usage in minutes for the user on the media devices . The sources for the content access data may include one or more of the media devices the content servers network devices caching servers content delivery network servers manual input and so forth.

At one or more content access limits associated with the user are retrieved. For example as shown here the user has a time limit of 45 minutes and the time used is 45 minutes. As discussed above the content access limits may be defined in terms of time cost or other metrics associated with user .

At the content access control server generates based at least in part on the content access data the content access status which specifies whether the one or more content access limits associated with the user have been met or exceeded. Continuing the example the user has a content access status which disallows access to content . As described above the content access status may be specific to content category or other attributes. In some implementations the content access status may indicate a range of time for which that content access status is deemed valid an expiration or a reset date and so forth.

At the content access control server receives a request from the content server for content access status of the user . In one implementation this request may be made as a hypertext transport protocol HTTP GET request.

At the content access control server retrieves the content access status and sends data indicative of the content access status to another device such as the requesting device. In some implementations the requesting device and the receiving device may be different. For example the media device may request the content access status but that information may be provided directly to the content server . As also described above in another implementation the content access status may be pushed or sent to other devices such as the content servers .

The disallowed content access status is configured to discontinue or prevent access to content by the user . For example the client control module may be configured to close executing application content upon receiving the content access status of disallowed . In comparison data indicative of the allowed content access status permits the content to be accessed.

At based on the content access status access to the content is allowed or disallowed. For example the content server may prevent or discontinue streaming of video content or the client control module may prevent the application content from executing.

Block determines an identity of the user . The media device may determine the identity of the user by acquiring one or more of a password image sound or biometric data associated with the user and comparing that acquired data with previously stored data to find a match or correspondence. In one implementation the media device may use facial recognition to determine the identity of the user .

Block receives a command to provide the user with access to the content . For example the user may have selected application content to execute on the media device using the user interface provided by the user interface module .

Block sends a request for content access status data associated with the user . For example the client control module may send an HTTP GET request to the interface module of the content access control server . The request may comprise data indicative of the content such as one or more of a content identifier a content title content category uniform resource identifier URI a uniform resource locator URL and so forth.

As described above the content access status may be based on the content access data . The content access data provides information about previous access by the user to one or more pieces of content across a plurality of media devices .

As also described above the content access status is determined based at least in part on one or more content access limits configured to specify for the user one or more restrictions on access to content . These restrictions may be based on one or more of a maximum time a maximum cost content category and so forth. As also described above the one or more content access limits may be based at least in part on the data indicative of the content . For example the content identifier content category and so forth.

Block receives the content access status data associated with the user . For example the client control module may receive an HTTP response containing the content access status .

Block processes the content access status data which was received to determine the content access status . When the content access status is determined to indicate that content access status is allowed the process proceeds to block . Block based at least in part on the allowed content access status provides the user with access to the content .

Returning to block when the content access status is determined to indicate the content access status is disallowed the process proceeds to block . Block based at least in part on the disallowed content access status denies the user access to the content . This denial may include terminating access preventing access degrading access and so forth.

Those having ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that certain steps or operations illustrated in the figures above can be eliminated or taken in an alternate order. Moreover the methods described above may be implemented as one or more software programs for a computer system and are encoded in a computer readable storage medium as instructions executable on one or more processors.

The computer readable storage medium can be any one of an electronic storage medium a magnetic storage medium an optical storage medium a quantum storage medium and so forth. Separate instances of these programs can be executed on or distributed across separate computer systems. Thus although certain steps have been described as being performed by certain devices software programs processes or entities this need not be the case and a variety of alternative implementations will be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art.

Additionally those having ordinary skill in the art readily recognize that the techniques described above can be utilized in a variety of devices environments and situations.

Although the present disclosure is written with respect to specific embodiments and implementations various changes and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art and it is intended that the present disclosure encompass such changes and modifications that fall within the scope of the appended claims.
