Officers at secure facilities face many challenges in monitoring the whereabouts of inmates. Such monitoring can include visual inspection and verification on a strict schedule. Such monitoring can also require the Officers to have a detailed knowledge of which inmates can associate with each other and which areas of a premises the individual inmates are permitted to occupy.

Various embodiments illustrated and described herein provide solutions to efficiently and accurately document information about offenders e.g. inmates . These and other embodiments are described with reference to the figures herein.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the inventive subject matter may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice them and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the inventive subject matter.

Such embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be referred to individually and or collectively herein by the term invention merely for convenience and without intending to limit the scope of this application to any single invention or inventive concept if more than one is in fact disclosed. The following description is therefore not to be taken in a limited sense and the scope of the inventive subject matter is defined by the appended claims.

The disclosure presents methods and apparatuses for automating offender documentation using one or more Radio Frequency Identification RFID readers. The RFID reader can scan for a transponder associated either directly or indirectly with an offender. The scanning can cause information associated with the item associated with the transponder to appear on a display coupled to the RFID reader. The user scanning the transponder can view add or alter the information that is displayed when the transponder is scanned. The RFID reader can send the data collected from the scan to a web service or middleware for analysis. Alternatively the RFID reader can do at least a portion of the analysis itself. The information that is entered can be saved to remote or local databases. In this way managing information about an offender or an item associated with the offender can be automatically maintained and updated. Such a system can be advantageous when implemented in a detention center incarceration facility mental health facility or any other place where information about people can be automatically tracked and managed.

Secure facility agencies face logistical communication and records management challenges when managing offenders e.g. incarcerated persons . This includes processing providing care and collecting a wide range of information about each of the offenders. Various embodiments illustrated and described herein include systems methods and software to assist in such situations. For example typical embodiments assist in rapid recording and monitoring a wide range of data about offenders including position of the offender at a given scan time and direction the offender was traveling at a given scan time. One or more embodiments may do so in a user friendly and efficient manner via a networked computing environment.

Custodians of persons in a facility manage many responsibilities including a significant amount of documentation in order to capture data pertinent to each person they are responsible for. Custodians e.g. secure facility officers may face challenges in managing persons in their facilities such as tracking their location or threats of litigation over certain neglectful conduct. To help mitigate such risks some embodiments herein include systems methods and software that provide automated data documentation or organization.

These and other advantages can be realized using one or more embodiments disclosed herein. The systems methods and software are now described in more detail with reference to the drawings.

The RFID readers A F can be mobile e.g. handheld or fixed in the area in which they are deployed. An example of a fixed RFID reader includes a portal based RFID reader that forces an offender to walk through a portal within range of the RFID reader . In the example shown in RFID readers A D and F are fixed while RFID reader E is mobile. The RFID readers A F can be assigned a name e.g. a collection of characters letters numbers or other symbols to uniquely identify the RFID reader . The RFID readers A F can each be assigned to a specific location. The RFID reader s location can be configured such that the RFID readers A F in aggregate can monitor a substantial portion of the area in which they are deployed for the presence of a transponder A D. In one or more embodiments the RFID readers A F can be configured to detect a transponder located within a specific range of the RFID reader A F. In such embodiments the RFID reader can send an interrogating signal to a transponder and receive an identifying signal in response to the transponder receiving the interrogating signal. The identifying signal can include a unique identifier corresponding to that transponder . The RFID reader can be internal or external to a building on the premises in which the system is deployed. For example RFID readers A D can be internal to a detention center building RFID reader E can be either internal or external to the detention center building and RFID reader F can be external to the detention center building such as in a courtyard or a recreation area.

The RFID readers A F can each be assigned to a specific customer e.g. an entity interested in using an automated offender documentation system . Such an assignment can help a data center manage information received from the RFID reader . The RFID readers A F can be connected to a server or a network see through a wired or wireless connection indicated by a lightning bolt in . A wired connection can include an Ethernet connection or other protocol operable to connect the RFID readers A F to the server or network. A wireless connection can include Wi Fi Bluetooth Zigbee or other protocol operable to wirelessly connect the RFID readers A F to the server or network .

An RFID reader A F can be associated with one or more programmable events . A programmable event can include an offender head count location verification or other event. For example the RFID readers A F can be programmed to perform a scan at a particular time. The results of the scan can be sent to the server . The results retrieved can be compared to a list of expected results. If the comparison shows an irregularity or a deviation from what is expected a warning or alert can be sent to the proper personnel e.g. one or more custodians responsible for managing the person associated with deviation . The proper personnel can then respond to the situation. In the case of a detention center a warning can be sent to a detention facility officer in charge of the offender corresponding to the deviation. The system can enable one or more RFID readers to perform one or more pre programmed programmable events such as simultaneously or on a scheduled or non scheduled basis. The programmable events can enable the RFID readers and the system to be flexible in implementing or at least partially automating a wide range of offender documentation services. The programmable events can allow an RFID reader to help perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

One or more user defined monitoring rules can be assigned to a programmable event . User defined monitoring rules can include offender movement restrictions e.g. offender A is not to be outside his cell at a certain time or offender relation restrictions e.g. offenders A and B are not to be within a certain distance of each other . The monitoring rules can include an offender s housing assignment or times that an offender is to be in there cell. Other user defined monitoring rules can include ensuring one or more inmates arrive to a pre defined destination within a predefined amount of time validating that inmates assigned to a housing unit are present e.g. conducting a head count or notifying system users that an RFID reader detected a transponder when no transponder detection was expected or allowed.

User defined processes can be assigned to a programmable event . User defined processes can include for example that a web service can search for predefined restrictions that might preclude an inmate from being able to enter a certain room or area or that two or more inmates are not allowed to associate with each other e.g. be within the same room or area of the facility . The user defined processes can validate that a direction an inmate was detected walking is acceptable. This can be accomplished using radar. The user defined processes can include a user causing an RFID reader to scan for a transponder in a specific location e.g. a multi purpose room such as a rec room .

A programmable event can be associated with more than one RFID reader . For example in the example of doing a head count in a secure facility a programmable event can trigger RFID readers A D to determine the number of offenders in their cell housing unit or some other location such as an infirmary or recreation yard. Associating a programmable event with an RFID reader can be done automatically such as by a computer processor or can be done manually by a user through an application configured to manage the configuration and implementation of an offender documentation system. The server A or B can instruct or poll the RFID readers A F for collected data or the RFID readers A F can be programmed to send the collected data to the server A B or the service . The data can be sent as soon as the data is collected on a pre determined schedule or a combination thereof.

One or more of the RFID readers A F can be configured to constantly or intermittently monitor for a nearby transponder e.g. a passing transponder or a transponder that has moved within range of the RFID reader . Such RFID readers can be helpful in monitoring areas where transponders are not expected to be or in monitoring transit points to monitor the progress of offenders in transit. When one of these RFID readers detects the presence of a transponder an alarm or message can be sent to the proper personnel such as through the server or the network . The message or alert can be a text message or other content message to a mobile device an email e.g. including an attachment or other notification.

The data sent from the RFID readers A F to the server can be encrypted. The data from the RFID reader can be sent to a server that is running middleware e.g. software that provides services to a software application beyond those available from an operating system or an application that logically and physically runs between a sender and a receiver .

In one or more embodiments rather than using middleware or calling one or more services e.g. services provided over the internet or through the network with or without the internet the RFID reader can include one or more services which may be in the form of an application programming interface API database connectivity client or other logical element to perform the functions of the middleware or the service . An example of an RFID reader that can be used to perform the functions of the middleware or the service is the FX7400 RFID reader from Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg Ill.

The RFID reader E can include a screen configured to display information related to scanning a transponder . The RFID reader E can be configured to display such as on display a schedule to a user indicating when or where RFID reader E scans are to occur.

The radar module can be situated near an RFID reader F to detect a number of offenders passing thereby or to detect a direction an offender is travelling. The radar module can be incorporated into an RFID reader . Including the radar module in the system can help a system determine the number of offenders the direction each offender is travelling or the like of a transponder within range of the radar module . Such information can be relayed to the server . The information sent to the server can be accompanied by an identification of the transponder and a nearby RFID reader .

The RFID reader can include one or more radar modules electrically or mechanically coupled thereto. An example of such a radar module or people counter is the OBID i Scan from Feig Electronic of Germany. Such radar modules are operable to detect persons moving towards and going away from the radar module or the associated RFID reader . The direction can be determined by transmitting a signal monitoring for signal reflections and detecting how much time it takes for the reflection to be detected by the radar module .

The transponder can transmit a unique identifying signal that is recognizable by an RFID reader . In one or more embodiments the transponder can emit the identifying signal in response to a signal sent from the RFID reader . The transponder can be incorporated into a bracelet a chip configured to be embedded in clothing an implantable device an identification card or may take some other form that allows the transponder to travel with an offender e.g. inmate or an item of interest. The transponder can be assigned to an individual offender or an entity at the secure facility other than an offender such as a detention center officer . In a system that includes a transponder associated with an entity at the secure facility the system can detect when the entity e.g. detention center officer is near an offender .

The server can be configured to run a web application or middleware configured to implement or manage automatic offender documentation. The server can receive data from the RFID readers A F. The data received can include a unique identification ID key that identifies the RFID reader A F that sent the data. The server can look up the RFID reader ID and correlate a specific time or location with the RFID reader A F. The server can send the time location and RFID ID data to another server B such as at a data center .

The server can be part of a Local Area Network LAN or it can be hosted remotely. The middleware that can be accessible through the server can either be hosted locally e.g. through a LAN or remotely. The middleware can send data received or modified by the server or middleware to a service .

While the server B service and the database are depicted as individual units they may be implemented on one or more servers. For example the server B service and database may all be implemented on the same server or each may be implemented on its own server.

The web application can render web pages that can provide the functionality of the service to a user. The web application can be hosted locally such as on server A or remotely such as on server B.

The networked system can include the system coupled to the data center such as through a network e.g. the internet . Such a configuration can allow the data storage for and analysis of monitoring RFID reader and transponder interactions to be off site. The data center can include a firewall B coupled to a server B and a service such that the firewall B can help to ensure that the data sent to the server B and the service will not harm the server B or service . The server B can be coupled to a database such that the database can provide data to the server and receive data from the server B. The server B can be coupled to the service such that the service can provide functionality related to automated offender documentation to the server B. The data received at the server B can be used in rendering web pages to users. The database can be coupled to the service to provide data to the service and to receive and store the results of operations performed by the service .

The firewalls A B can scan incoming and outgoing data for malware to help reduce the chances of a malicious attack on the system . The firewall A can encrypt data that is outgoing or decrypt data that is incoming. The encryption or decryption can be accomplished using a separate encryption or decryption module and can be incorporated at different places in the system such as on an RFID reader so as to allow encrypted data sent to be sent to the server B.

The service can be deployed locally on the server B or hosted remotely. The service can retrieve programmable events currently assigned to an RFID reader . The programmable events can be stored in the database on the server A B or on the service . The service can run processes associated with a programmable event . For example the service can analyze organize or format collected data. The analyzed organized or collected data can be sent to the database for retention. The analysis can include comparing the data to monitoring rules associated with a programmable event . Such comparisons can monitor compliance and detect violations of the monitoring rules and an alarm alert or message can be sent to the proper personnel when a monitoring rule has been violated.

The service can correlate collected data. A correlation of data can help the service detect a violation of a monitoring rule . A correlation can be performed at an individual offender level a block level an entire building e.g. secure facility such as a detention center mental health facility or the like level or other level. For example the service can correlate all data associated with the same offender or a cellblock and compare that data to the monitoring rules relating to the offender or the cellblock to determine if the offenders comply with the monitoring rule or a violation has occurred. The service can compare one offender s data to another offender s data to determine if a monitoring rule violation has occurred. Such comparisons can be useful when a monitoring rule states that two or more offenders are to be kept separately not contact each other or otherwise not associate with each other. The service can be hosted locally as shown or can be hosted on the network e.g. cloud .

The service can receive and process data from the middleware . The processing can include authenticating a customer name. Authenticating a customer name can be done by verifying a customer s port number in examples where a customer has been assigned a unique port number. Authenticating can also include verifying RFID reader A F ID information and transponder A D ID information received is consistent and assigned to that customer. A user e.g. an end user can automate the running of programmable events through scheduling them through the service . A user can manually trigger a programmable event to for the service to execute. The user can customize the operations performed by the service in running a programmable event such as through the server A B or web application. The service can compare data received to monitoring rules and determine if a monitoring has been violated. The service can initiate an alert process in response to determining that a rule has been violated.

The database can store monitoring rules therein. The monitoring rules can define the relationship between or validate the performance expectations between a programmable event and a transponder . This can include cross referencing other monitoring rules e.g. restrictions or requirements associated with a given transponder . For example an offender could be restricted from moving or from entering a specific room or area of a building. The rule or restriction could be for punitive reasons health concerns safety concerns or the like. For example a monitoring rule can indicate that one or more inmates are to be kept separate at all times. The monitoring rule can have an associated duration in which the monitoring is valid and is to be referenced by the service . One or more monitoring rules can be associated with a specific offender such that when the offender is no longer in the building the monitoring rule is no longer referenced by the service .

The service can analyze the data received from the RFID readers A F and compare the received data to relevant monitoring rules to determine if an alert or message should be sent to the relevant personnel. If no violation is detected the service can initiate a sequence of operations e.g. a pre programmed sequence of operations processes or events to complete. For example the service can look for a violation of a user defined process rule e.g. an inmate is travelling the wrong direction or there are too many inmates in a specific area . The service can then search for violations of monitoring rules e.g. a first inmate cannot be in a specific area because a second inmate is already present in the area an inmate is not allowed to be in the rec area or other monitoring rule violation . The service can then continue to perform another process e.g. a user defined process such as documenting the locations of inmates that are within the range of an RFID reader . Future data received can be analyzed e.g. compared to monitoring rules in real time to determine if an alert or message is to be sent. When the analysis is complete the service can record that the analysis was completed in the database .

In the case of an Internet failure e.g. the Internet is temporarily unavailable the middleware can be configured to store received data in a local memory. When Internet connectivity is restored the received data can be sent to the service . Such a configuration can be helpful in embodiments that include Software as a Service SaaS or a remotely hosted server. The middleware can be configured to determine if a monitoring rule has been violated such as when the Internet connection to the service has failed. In one or more embodiments the middleware includes a subset of all the monitoring rules for a specific system. These monitoring rules can be the most important rules e.g. the rules that the user does not want violated . In one or more embodiments the service can determine if a monitoring rule has been violated after it has received the relevant data.

The middleware can reside on the server A or B locally or remotely respectively. In one or more embodiments the middleware can be hosted in a network e.g. cloud server. Such an implementation can provide automated offender documentation to a user through a Software as a Service SaaS configuration. The middleware can provide communication between the RFID readers A F and the data center . The middleware can be configured to encrypt data it receives from the RFID readers A F and send the encrypted data to the service server B or the database .

The database can store data from the RFID readers A B the service the web application or the server A B.
