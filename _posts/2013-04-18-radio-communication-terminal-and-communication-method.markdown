The present invention relates to a radio communication terminal having a communication application installed therein and being capable of executing direct communication with another radio communication terminal without involving a radio access network and also to a communication method.

Conventionally Bluetooth registered trademark and ad hoc mode of a wireless LAN are known as so called Device to Device D2D communication that is a radio communication method in which multiple radio communication terminals sometimes referred to simply as terminals hereinbelow perform radio communication with each other directly without involving a radio base station or an access point. Such a radio method achieves short range radio communication by using relatively low radio transmission power. For this reason it is difficult to use this radio communication method when the inter terminal distance is long. In addition in such a radio communication method the radio transmission capacity is limited compared to a radio access network e.g. UTRA 3G E UTRA LTE or GERAN 2G managed by a telecommunications carrier.

Against this background it is being discussed to achieve the D2D communication by using a radio access network provided by a telecommunications carrier e.g. Non patent document 1 .

In the case of using a radio access technology employed in such a radio access network the terminals uses a frequency band which the telecommunications carrier is licensed to use by supervisory authorities and therefore are enabled to output higher radio transmission power and achieve long distance large capacity D2D communication without using resources on the network side such as a radio base station. Such a characteristic is considered particularly effective when the network side such as the radio base station is devastated by an earthquake or the like. In addition when the D2D communication is achieved using the frequency band used in a radio access network managed by a telecommunications carrier the terminals can perform the D2D communication without being equipped with a module for another type of radio communication e.g. Bluetooth registered trademark which offers advantages such as cost and size reductions for the terminals.

However performing D2D communication by using the radio access network described above has the following problem. Specifically when a communication application installed in the terminal wants to execute D2D communication the communication application cannot find out if D2D communication can be executed with a communication counterpart terminal or not. For this reason the terminal cannot effectively initiate D2D communication.

Thus the present invention has been made in view of such circumstances and has an objective of providing a radio communication terminal and a communication method capable of causing a communication application to speedily find out whether device to device direct communication D2D communication is possible or not in a case where the D2D communication is to be performed by using a radio access network such as LTE.

A first feature of the present invention is summarized as a billing system including a radio communication terminal having a communication application installed therein and being capable of executing direct communication with another radio communication terminal without involving a radio access network the radio communication terminal including a terminal finding unit configured to find a candidate terminal capable of executing direct communication with the radio communication terminal a phonebook processing unit configured to obtain second phonebook data containing an identifier of the candidate terminal found by the terminal finding unit based on first phonebook data containing an identifier of the other radio communication terminal and being associated with the radio communication terminal and a direct communication execution unit configured to execute direct communication with a counterpart terminal indicated in a communication request from the communication application when the counterpart terminal is contained in the second phonebook data as the candidate terminal.

A second feature of the present invention is summarized as a billing system including a communication method performed by a radio communication terminal having a communication application installed therein and being capable of executing direct communication with another radio communication terminal without involving a radio access network the method including the steps of finding a candidate terminal capable of executing direct communication with the radio communication terminal obtaining second phonebook data containing an identifier of the candidate terminal found by the finding step based on first phonebook data containing an identifier of the other radio communication terminal and being associated with the radio communication terminal and executing direct communication with a counterpart terminal indicated in a communication request from the communication application when the counterpart terminal is contained in the second phonebook data as the candidate terminal.

Next an embodiment of the present invention will be described. Note that in the following description of the drawings same or similar reference signs denote same or similar elements and portions. In addition it should be noted that the drawings are schematic and ratios of dimensions and the like are different from actual ones.

Therefore specific dimensions and the like should be determined in consideration of the following description. Moreover the drawings also include portions having different dimensional relationships and ratios from each other.

The radio base station performs operation conforming to a radio access technology RAT standardized by 3GPP e.g. Long Term Evolution LTE . In this embodiment the radio base station controls direct communication among the terminals A to D. More specifically the radio base station controls the direct communication by causing the radio base station to transmit broadcast information indicating whether or not to permit communication among the terminals A to D without involving the radio base station i.e. without involving a radio access network. Note that the broadcast information for controlling direct communication among the terminals A to D may be broadcasted separately from multiple radio base stations e.g. the radio base station and another radio base station not shown .

In this way in the radio communication system direct communication among the terminals A to D is permitted based on the broadcast information from the radio access network side. In addition when it is based on broadcast information from another radio base station not shown for example direct communication may be permitted based on the broadcast information from the other radio base station even in an area not covered by the radio base station .

The phonebook server manages phonebook data associated with the terminal A to D the same applies below . Specifically the phonebook server acquires phonebook data from the terminal A and then performs tasks such as retaining and updating the phonebook data and responding to a telephone number inquiry.

The terminals A to D are each a User Equipment UE having a communication application installed therein and being configured to execute radio communication conforming to a radio access technology such as LTE. The terminal A to D can perform communication with another terminal via the radio base station and can perform direct communication with another terminal without involving the radio base station .

Specifically the terminal A to D determines whether direct communication is executable or not based on the broadcast information broadcasted from the radio base station and executes direct communication at a predetermined timing or any timing. Note that for this determination information notified of by a communication control apparatus not shown which controls the radio base station and terminals A to D e.g. a direct communication permission notification may be added as an element of determination.

Next a functional block configuration of the radio communication system is described. Specifically a functional block configuration of the terminal A to D is described. is a functional block configuration diagram of the terminal A.

As shown in the terminal A includes a terminal finding unit communication applications A to C a phonebook processing unit and a direct communication execution unit . Note that the terminals B to D have similar functional block configurations to that of the terminal A.

The terminal finding unit finds a candidate terminal e.g. the terminal B capable of executing direct communication with the terminal A. Specifically the terminal finding unit finds a terminal capable of executing direct communication with the terminal A based on the radio field intensities of radio signals sent from the terminals B to D or on a reachable range of radio signals sent by the terminal A. The terminal finding unit uniquely identifies the terminals B to D based on their identifiers such as telephone numbers or URIs such as email addresses or SIP URIs and extracts a terminal capable of executing direct communication with the terminal A.

The communication applications A to C are each a communication application installed in the terminal A. Specifically the communication application A is an application operated only through direct communication and is for example an application for delivering advertisement through direct communication.

The communication application B is a communication application provided via the radio access network and is for example an application for web browsing or video playback.

The communication application C is an application which can be provided either through direct communication or via the radio access network and includes an application for for example making voice calls sending instant messages IM or the like. The communication application C therefore supports both direct communication and regular communication performed via the radio access network.

The phonebook processing unit executes processing regarding phonebook data associated with the terminal A. Specifically the phonebook processing unit has a regular phonebook retention unit and a direct communication phonebook retention unit . The regular phonebook retention unit retains regular phonebook data and the direct communication phonebook retention unit retains direct communication phonebook data. In this embodiment the regular phonebook data contains identifiers of other terminals or specifically the terminals B to D and configures first phonebook data associated with the terminal A. The first phonebook data associated with the terminal A is phonebook data which can be used as phonebook data for the terminal A and may be generated inside or outside of the terminal A. The direct communication phonebook data configures second phonebook data containing an identifier of a candidate terminal e.g. the terminal B found by the terminal finding unit .

Based on the regular phonebook data the phonebook processing unit obtains the direct communication phonebook data containing the identifier of the candidate terminal. Specifically when the regular phonebook data contains the identifier of the candidate terminal the phonebook processing unit adds this identifier of the candidate terminal to the direct communication phonebook data. Such processing by the phonebook processing unit generates the direct communication phonebook data constituted by the identifiers of candidate terminals capable of direct communication. In other words the phonebook processing unit generates the direct communication phonebook data by acquiring a candidate terminal found by the terminal finding unit and using the identifier of the candidate terminal contained in the regular phonebook data. Note that the phonebook processing unit may instead of storing the direct communication phonebook data described above as a database temporarily load phonebook data into memory and select the identifier of the candidate terminal from the loaded data.

Moreover in response to a communication request from the communication application C which can be provided either through direct communication or via the radio access network the phonebook processing unit can provide the regular phonebook data and the direct communication phonebook data to the communication application C.

The direct communication execution unit executes direct communication with another terminal e.g. the terminal B which is located within a predetermined distance from the terminal A and is therefore capable of executing direct communication with the terminal A. Specifically the direct communication execution unit executes the direct communication with the counterpart terminal when the counterpart terminal the terminal B indicated in the communication request from the communication application A or the communication application C is contained in the direct communication phonebook data as a candidate terminal.

The direct communication execution unit can receive permission information on direct communication via the radio access network. Upon receipt of the permission information the direct communication execution unit executes direct communication with a candidate terminal indicated in the communication request from the communication application A or the communication application C.

Next operation of the above described radio communication system is described. Specifically a description is given of operation of the terminal A generating direct communication phonebook data second phonebook data and executing direct communication by using the direct communication phonebook data.

The terminal A finds a terminal capable of direct communication S . Specifically the terminal A sends radio signals to other terminals located around the terminal A and detects whether they respond to the radio signals or not. The terminal A detects the response and thereby extracts a terminal capable of direct communication.

The terminal A acquires the identifier of a terminal the response from which was detected a candidate terminal and generates direct communication phonebook data by using regular phonebook data which the terminal A retains S . Specifically as described earlier when the regular phonebook data contains the identifier of the candidate terminal the terminal A adds the identifier of the candidate terminal to the direct communication phonebook data.

Further a phonebook like the one in or may display a communication application such as one for making voice calls or sending IMs which can be provided through direct communication so that when a user commands activation of the application direct communication with a counterpart terminal is executed.

The communication application activated in the terminal A refers to the direct communication phonebook data S .

This communication application can access the direct communication phonebook data via an application programming interface API for the phonebook. In order for the communication application which uses direct communication to use the API the communication application notifies that the communication application uses direct communication when using the API. Upon receipt of this notification the phonebook processing unit provides the direct communication phonebook data to the communication application. Thereby the communication application determines whether direct communication with a counterpart terminal is possible or not.

In response to a request from the communication application the terminal A executes direct communication with the counterpart terminal S .

The terminal A to D the same applies below obtains based on regular phonebook data direct communication phonebook data containing an identifier of a candidate terminal capable of direct communication. Specifically the terminal A acquires a candidate terminal found by the terminal finding unit and generates direct communication phonebook data by using regular phonebook data. Thus the communication application A and the communication application C can find out speedily whether device to device direct communication D2D communication is possible or not in a case where the D2D communication is to be executed by using a radio access network such as LTE.

In other words the user of the terminal A can find a radio communication terminal capable of D2D communication speedily and easily.

The phonebook processing unit includes a regular phonebook retention unit and a direct communication phonebook retention unit . The regular phonebook retention unit and the direct communication phonebook retention unit have similar functions to those of the regular phonebook retention unit and the direct communication phonebook retention unit of the terminal A respectively.

The communication request processing unit processes a communication request sent from the terminal A to D . Notified of the communication request by the communication request processing unit the phonebook processing unit refers to the regular phonebook retention unit or the direct communication phonebook retention unit and responds to the communication request processing unit with the identifier such as a telephone number of a counterpart terminal contained in the communication request and a result indicating whether direct communication is possible or not. The communication request processing unit then notifies the terminal A to D of the identifier of the counterpart terminal and the result of whether direct communication is possible or not which are contained in the response from the phonebook processing unit .
