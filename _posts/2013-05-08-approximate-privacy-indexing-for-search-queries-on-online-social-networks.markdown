title: Approximate privacy indexing for search queries on online social networks
abstract: In one embodiment, a method includes receiving from a first user of an online social network a search query, searching data stores to identify objects that match the search query, where identifying the objects is also based in part on the privacy setting for each object, determining for each identified object a visibility of the object with respect to the first user, and generating one or more search results corresponding to the search query.

This disclosure generally relates to social graphs and performing searches for objects within a social networking environment.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Social graph analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual actors within the networks and edges represent the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph based structures are often very complex. There can be many types of nodes and many types of edges for connecting nodes. In its simplest form a social graph is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.

There may be information associated with particular users stored with the system e.g. in connection with the corresponding user accounts . Each user may upload and submit information to the system. The system may store each user s information on behalf of that user and in association with that user. The user may access his information stored with the system. In addition the user may choose to grant other users access to his information stored with the system.

In particular embodiments a user of a social networking system may search for objects associated with the system using search queries.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may improve the indexing process by searching data stores for matching objects that have a privacy setting that is likely to allow the objects to be accessed by a querying user. In response to a search query received from a first user i.e. the querying user the social networking system may access one or more data stores to search for matching objects. Typically the social networking system may perform privacy checks using a frontend process that filters out search results just before results are sent to the user. For example access control using privacy settings may be performed by a frontend PHP process hosed by the social networking system. After a data store has been searched to identify objects matching the search query the privacy settings for each identified object may be used to filter out results that are not visible to the user such that only objects that are visible to the user are sent to the user as search results. However performing privacy checks at this step may result in a large number of objects that are identified when searching a data store to be filtered out such that additional indexing must be performed in order to generate an adequate number of search results. The efficiency of the indexing process may be improved by applying privacy filters when querying data stores. In particular embodiments the privacy check process may be approximated during indexing by searching for objects that both match the search query and also have a privacy setting that would allow the querying user to access the object. In this way objects that are identified during indexing may effectively be pre filtered based on privacy settings such that the identified object are more likely to make it through the frontend privacy checks and be generated as search results. This may allow the social networking system to reduce the amount of data over fetching needed to generate search result.

In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to a user of social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments when a user registers for an account with social networking system social networking system may create a user node corresponding to the user and store the user node in one or more data stores. Users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to registered users and user nodes associated with registered users. In addition or as an alternative users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to users that have not registered with social networking system . In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may provide his or her name profile picture contact information birth date sex marital status family status employment education background preferences interests or other demographic information. In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social network system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments each object may correspond to a particular node of a social graph . An edge connecting the particular node and another node may indicate a relationship between objects corresponding to these nodes. In addition to storing objects a particular data store may also store social graph information relating to the object. Alternatively social graph information about particular objects may be stored in a different data store from the objects. Social networking system may update the search index of the data store based on newly received objects and relationships associated with the received objects.

In particular embodiments each data store may be configured to store objects of a particular one of a plurality of object types in respective data storage devices . An object type may be for example a user a photo a post a comment a message an event listing a webpage an application a location a user profile page a concept profile page a user group an audio file a video an offer coupon or another suitable type of object. Although this disclosure describes particular types of objects this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of objects. As an example and not by way of limitation a user vertical P1 illustrated in may store user objects. Each user object stored in the user vertical P1 may comprise an identifier e.g. a character string a user name and a profile picture for a user of the online social network. Social networking system may also store in the user vertical P1 information associated with a user object such as language location education contact information interests relationship status a list of friends contacts a list of family members privacy settings and so on. As an example and not by way of limitation a post vertical P2 illustrated in may store post objects. Each post object stored in the post vertical P2 may comprise an identifier a text string for a post posted to social networking system . Social networking system may also store in the post vertical P2 information associated with a post object such as a time stamp an author privacy settings users who like the post a count of likes comments a count of comments location and so on. As an example and not by way of limitation a photo vertical P3 may store photo objects or objects of other media types such as video or audio . Each photo object stored in the photo vertical P3 may comprise an identifier and a photo. Social networking system may also store in the photo vertical P3 information associated with a photo object such as a time stamp an author privacy settings users who are tagged in the photo users who like the photo comments and so on. In particular embodiments each data store may also be configured to store information associated with each stored object in data storage devices .

In particular embodiments objects stored in each vertical may be indexed by one or more search indices. The search indices may be hosted by respective index server comprising one or more computing devices e.g. servers . The index server may update the search indices based on data e.g. a photo and information associated with a photo submitted to social networking system by users or other processes of social networking system or a third party system . The index server may also update the search indices periodically e.g. every 24 hours . The index server may receive a query comprising a search term and access and retrieve search results from one or more search indices corresponding to the search term. In some embodiments a vertical corresponding to a particular object type may comprise a plurality of physical or logical partitions each comprising respective search indices.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive a search query from a PHP Hypertext Preprocessor process . The PHP process may comprise one or more computing processes hosted by one or more servers of social networking system . The search query may be a text string or a search query submitted to the PHP process by a user or another process of social networking system or third party system .

More information on indexes and search queries may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 560 212 filed 27 Jul. 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 560 901 filed 27 Jul. 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 723 861 filed 21 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments one or more of the objects stored in a data store may be associated with a privacy setting. The privacy settings or access settings for an object may be stored in any suitable manner such as for example in association with the object in an index on the authorization server in another suitable manner or any combination thereof. Privacy settings may be managed or enforces via one or more authorization privacy servers of social networking system . A privacy setting of an object may specify how the object or particular information associated with an object can be accessed viewed or shared using the online social network. Where the privacy settings for an object allow a particular user to access view or share that object the object may be described as being visible with respect to that user. As an example and not by way of limitation a user of the online social network may set privacy settings for a user profile page specifying a set of users that may access the work experience information on the user profile page thus excluding other users from accessing the information. In other words the user profile page may be not visible to the excluded users. In particular embodiments the privacy settings may specify a blocked list of users that should not be allowed to access view or share certain information associated with the object. In other words the blocked list may specify one or more users or entities for which an object is not visible. As an example and not by way of limitation a user may specify a set of users that may not access photos albums associated with the user thus excluding those users from accessing the photo albums while also possibly allowing certain users not within the set of users to access the photo albums . In particular embodiments privacy settings may be associated with particular social graph elements. Privacy settings of a social graph element such as a node or an edge may specify how the social graph element or connections between elements information associated with the social graph element or content objects associated with the social graph element can be accessed or shared using the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation a particular concept node corresponding to a particular photo may have a privacy setting specifying that the photo may only be viewed by users tagged in the photo and their friends. In particular embodiments an authorization server may allow users to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social networking system or shared with other systems e.g. third party system such as for example by specifying appropriate privacy settings. In particular embodiments the privacy settings associated with an object may specify any suitable granularity of permitted access or denial of access. As an example and not by way of limitation access or denial of access may be specified for particular users e.g. only me my roommates and my boss users within a particular degrees of separation e.g. friends or friends of friends user groups e.g. the gaming club my family user networks e.g. employees of particular employers students or alumni of particular university all users public no users private users of third party systems particular applications e.g. third party applications external websites other suitable users or entities or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments privacy access settings may place additional restrictions on accessing an object or information associated with the objects. Additional restrictions may include for example granting access to only users legally allowed to drink alcohol granting access to only those with shared experiences or shared interests restricting access to minors restriction access to content owned by minors children or deceased persons or any combination thereof. Although this disclosure describes using particular privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates using any suitable privacy settings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more authorization privacy servers may be used to enforce one or more privacy settings for objects associated with the online social network. The authorization servers may be one or more servers of social networking system . In response to a request from a user or other entity for a particular object stored in a data store social networking system may send a request to the data store for the object. The request may identify the user associated with the request and may only be sent to the user or a client system of the user if the authorization server determines that the user is authorized to access the object based on the privacy settings associated with the object. If the requesting user is not authorized to access the object the authorization server may prevent the requested object from being retrieved from the data store or may prevent the requested object from be sent to the user. In the search query context an object may only be generated as a search result if the querying user is authorized to view or access the object. In other words the object must have a visibility that is visible to the querying user. If the object has a visibility that is not visible to the user the object may be excluded from the search results. In particular embodiments the privacy settings for social graph elements may be storied a data structure that may be represented as a privacy graph having a number of nodes and edges. The privacy graph may represent the visibility of particular social graph elements with respect to each other based on their connections to each other. When a user requests a specific piece of information stored in data store the access control of the social graph element may be verified and validated with respect to the requesting user or entity by dynamically e.g. in real time filtering with respect to the privacy graph. Although this disclosure describes enforcing privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates enforcing privacy settings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may improve the indexing process by searching data stores for matching objects that have a privacy setting that is likely to allow the objects to be accessed by a querying user. In response to a search query received from a first user i.e. the querying user social networking system may access one or more data stores to search for matching objects. In particular embodiments social networking system may perform privacy checks using a frontend process that filters out search results just before results are sent to the user. As an example and not by way of limitation access control using privacy settings may be performed by a PHP process hosed by one or more servers of social networking system . After a data store has been searched to identify objects matching the search query the privacy settings for each identified object may be used to filter out results that are not visible to the user such that only objects that are visible to the user are sent to the user as search results. However performing privacy checks at this step may result in a large number of objects that are identified when indexing a data store to be filtered out such that additional indexing must be performed in order to generate an adequate number of search results. The efficiency of the indexing process may be improved by applying privacy filters when querying data stores . In particular embodiments the privacy check process may be approximated during indexing by searching for objects that both match the search query and also have a privacy setting that would allow the querying user to access the object. In this way objects that are identified during indexing may effectively be pre filtered based on privacy settings such that the identified object are more likely to make it through the frontend privacy checks and be generated as search results. This may allow social networking system to reduce the amount of data over fetching needed to generate search result. Although this disclosure describes searching an online social network using approximate privacy indexing in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates searching an online social network using approximate privacy indexing in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node a search query. The search query may be a text query and may comprise one or more character strings which may include one or more n grams . In general a user may input any character string comprising one or more characters into query field to search for objects on social networking system that substantially matches the character string. The search query may also be a structured query comprising references to particular nodes or edges from social graph . The structured queries may be based on the natural language strings generated by one or more grammars as described previously. As an example and not by way of limitation the search query Friends of Stephanie may be a structured query where Friends and Stephanie in the search query are references corresponding to particular social graph elements. The reference to Stephanie would correspond to a particular user node where social networking system has parsed the n gram my girlfriend to correspond with a user node for the user Stephanie while the reference to Friends would correspond to friend type edges connecting that user node to other user nodes i.e. edges connecting to Stephanie s first degree friends . The search query may be received in any suitable manner such as for example by having the user input the search query into a query field on a webpage of the online social network. Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner. More information on search queries may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 060 filed 23 Jul. 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 732 175 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may parse the search query received from the first user i.e. the querying user to identify one or more n grams. In general an n gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items may be characters phonemes syllables letters words base pairs prefixes or other identifiable items from the sequence of text or speech. The n gram may comprise one or more characters of text letters numbers punctuation etc. entered by the querying user. An n gram of size one can be referred to as a unigram of size two can be referred to as a bigram or digram of size three can be referred to as a trigram and so on. Each n gram may include one or more parts from the search query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a character string e.g. one or more characters of text entered by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may parse the search query all about recipes to identify the following n grams all about recipes all about about recipes all about recipes. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a contiguous sequence of n items from the search query. Although this disclosure describes parsing particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates parsing any suitable queries in any suitable manner. In connection with element detection and parsing search queries particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 732 101 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate a query command based on a search query received from a querying user. The query command may then be used in a search against objects in one or more data stores of the social networking system . In particular embodiments the query command may be provided for a search using search indices for one or more data stores of social networking system . The query command may comprise one or more query constraints. Each query constraint may be identified by social networking system based on a parsing of the search query. Each query constraint may be a request for a particular object type. In particular embodiments the query command may comprise query constraints in symbolic expression or s expression. Social networking system may parse the search query Photos I like to a query command photos liked by . The query command photos liked by denotes a query for photos liked by a user i.e. which corresponding to the querying user with a single result type of photo. The query constraint may include for example social graph constraints e.g. requests for particular nodes or nodes types or requests for nodes connected to particular edges or edge types object constraints e.g. request for particular objects or object types location constraints e.g. requests for objects or social graph entities associates with particular geographic locations other suitable constraints or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments the parsing of the search query may be based on the grammar used to generate the search query. In other words the generated query command and its query constraints may correspond to a particular grammar or a sub tree from a grammar forest . In particular embodiments a query command may comprise prefix and an object. The object may correspond to a particular node in the social graph while the prefix may correspond to a particular edge or edge type indicating a particular type of relationship connecting to the particular node in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation the query command pages liked by comprises a prefix pages liked by and an object . In particular embodiments social networking system may execute a query command by traversing the social graph from the particular node along the particular connecting edges or edge types to nodes corresponding to objects specified by query command in order to identify one or more search results. As an example and not by way of limitation the query command pages liked by may be executed by social networking system by traversing the social graph from a user node corresponding to along like type edges to concept nodes corresponding to pages liked by . Although this disclosure describes generating particular query commands in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable query commands in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may access one or more data stores in response to a search query received from a user. Each data store may store one or more objects associated with the online social network. In particular embodiments social networking system may search each accessed data store to identify one or more objects associated with the data store that substantially match the search query. Social networking system may identify matching objects in any suitable manner such as for example by using one or more string matching algorithms to match the character string with a string of characters associated with each of one or more of the objects. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to a search query Friends of Mark named Kaiser social networking system may access one or more users data stores and search the accessed data stores to identify objects e.g. user profile pages stored in those data stores that match the query. Social networking system may search each accessed data store using the following query command 

In particular embodiments when identifying objects that match a search query social networking system may identify the objects based in part on a privacy setting associated with the object. Certain objects are unlikely to be visible to the querying user because of the privacy settings associated with the object. As an example and not by way of limitation an object having privacy settings specifying the object can be accessed by for example only me or friends only may be likely to not be visible to a querying user doing a global search for particular types of object. Similarly objects having privacy settings specifying for example public or friends of friends may be likely to be visible to the querying user. In order to reduce the number of identified objects that need to be sent to the frontend e.g. PHP process to generate a sufficient number of search results for the querying user a coarse privacy index can be used when indexing data stores to reduce the number of invisible results that are sent to the frontend which may eventually filter them out . In particular embodiments in response to a query command requesting objects matching a search query data store may access a coarse privacy index listing the privacy settings for each object stored in the data store . This coarse privacy index can then be used to pre filter results that should be invisible to the querying user e.g. filter out all objects with an only me privacy setting . Thus when searching a data store for objects matching a search query social networking system may use the coarse privacy index to determine whether the privacy setting of an object is likely to make the object visible to the querying user. Social networking system may then preferentially identify objects having a privacy setting more likely to be visible to the querying user and not identify or be less likely to identify objects having a privacy setting less likely to be visible to the querying user. In particular embodiments identifying objects based in part on a privacy setting associated with the object may comprise determining whether the privacy setting of an object matches a privacy setting specified in the query command. The query command may be generated such that at least one of the query constraints of the query command request objects having particular privacy settings. In this way then the query command is executed during the indexing process the request for objects matching the search query may also specify that the identify object must also match particular privacy settings. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior example in response to a search query Friends of Mark named Kaiser social networking system may search each accessed data store based in part on privacy settings using the following query command 

In particular embodiments when identifying objects based in part on the privacy settings for the object social networking system may identify a particular number of objects having privacy settings likely to make the object visible to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation the query command used to search a data store may use a weak AND WAND or strong OR SOR operator to specify a particular number or percentage of object that should be identified as having a particular privacy setting. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior example in response to a search query Friends of Mark named Kaiser social networking system may search each accessed data store based in part on privacy settings using the following query command 

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the identified objects. The objects may be scored based on one or more factors such as for example social graph information social graph affinity search history privacy settings other suitable factors or any combination thereof. Objects may also be scored based on advertising sponsorship. In particular embodiments social networking system may score the objects based on a privacy setting associated with the object. Objects having privacy settings that make the object more likely to be visible to the querying user may be scored better than objects having privacy settings that make them less likely to be visible to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation an object having a privacy setting of public may be scored better than an object having a privacy setting of friends of friends . Similarly an object having a privacy setting of friends only may be scored better than an object having a privacy setting of only me . In particular embodiments social networking system may score the objects based on a social graph affinity associated with the querying user or the user node of the querying user . Social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. Although this disclosure describes scoring objects in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates scoring objects in any suitable manner. Furthermore in connection with social graph affinity and affinity coefficients particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 869 field 1 Oct. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments when searching data stores to identify matching objects social networking system may only identify and score up to a threshold number of matching nodes in a particular data store . This threshold number of matching objects may then be scored and ranked by the social networking system . The threshold number may be chosen to enhance search quality or to optimize the processing of search results. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may only identify the top N matching objects i.e. the number to score in a users data store in response to a query command requesting users. The top N objects may be determined by a static ranking e.g. ranking based on the current social graph affinity of the user with respect to the querying user of the objects in a search index corresponding to the users data store . In particular embodiments the top N identified object may be re ranked based on the search query itself. As an example and not by way of limitation if the number to score is 500 the top 500 objects may be identified. These 500 objects may then be ranked based on one or more factors e.g. match to the search query or other query constraints social graph affinity search history etc. and the top M results may then be sent to the frontend to be checked for privacy control before being generated as search results. In particular embodiments the top results after one or more rounds of rankings may be sent to an aggregator for a final round of ranking where identified objects may be reordered redundant results may be dropped or any other type of results processing may occur before presentation to the querying user. Although this disclosure describes identifying particular numbers of objects this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable numbers of objects. Furthermore although this disclosure describes ranking objects in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates ranking objects in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments when generating search results in response to a structured search query the social networking system may filter the search results based on privacy settings associated with particular objects. After a search query is indexed by social networking system e.g. by an index server and objects satisfying the search query have been identified social networking system may then perform privacy checks on each identified object which may also be referred to as a target object . In particular embodiments social networking system may determine for each identified object a visibility of the object with respect to the querying user. Each target object and more specifically the target nodes corresponding to the target object may be associated with privacy settings that specify which other users of the online social network may view or access the content object. As an example and not by way of limitation particular object corresponding to particular social graph elements may not be visible to the querying user and thus indexed results including such an object should not be sent to the user as a search result. Consequently particular target objects may not be displayed in the search results because of the privacy settings associated with that content. illustrates an example social graph . The social graph illustrated in may be referenced in some of the examples below to illustrate how privacy settings are used to filter search results. Although this disclosure describes filtering search results based on privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates filtering search results based on privacy settings in any suitable manner. More information on privacy settings and filtering search results may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 017 filed 23 Jul. 2012 which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may access the privacy settings associated with each target object or its corresponding node . The privacy settings for each object may define the visibility of the object the visibility of the node corresponding to the object or the visibility of edges connecting to that node to users of the social networking system . In this way the ability of users of the online social network or even users outside the network may be restricted by limiting their ability to view or access profile pages or other related content objects associated with particular nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user s privacy settings specify that his profile page can only be viewed or accessed by friends of friends i.e. second degree friends thereby preventing users who are three or more degrees of separation from the first user from viewing or accessing the first user s profile page. As another example and not by way of limitation referencing the privacy settings for user 9 may specify that his educational information is not visible to other users and therefore the attended edge connecting the user node for user 9 to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford may not be visible to other users. Thus the privacy settings for user 9 would prevent references to his user node or corresponding user profile page from appearing in search results for users that attended Stanford. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates accessing any suitable privacy settings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may whether an object has a visibility that is visible to the querying user. After indexing a data store in response to a search query from a querying user as described previously social networking system may have identified one or more object matching the search query. The identified objects may also have privacy settings that make the object likely to be visible to the querying user. Social networking system may then enforce the privacy settings for each identified object by determining whether the privacy settings for a particular object allow it to be accessed by the particular querying user. If the object has a visibility that is visible to the querying user then social networking system may select the object to be included in the generated search result. However if the object has a visibility that is not visible to the querying user the social networking system may exclude the object from the generated search results. In particular embodiments social networking system may select object corresponding to nodes that are connected to the user node of the querying user in the social graph by a series of nodes and edges that have a visibility that is visible to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing the structured query Friends of User 5 may identify the target nodes for user 4 and user 7. Assuming the querying user can view the node for user 5 then the privacy settings of users 4 5 and 7 may be accessed to determine whether the edges connecting these users are visible. For example either users 4 or 5 may have privacy settings that make it so the friend edge connecting them is not visible to particular other users if this edge is visible to the querying user then the generated search results could include a reference to user 4. Similarly either users 5 or 7 may have privacy settings that make it so the friend edge connecting them is not visible thus if this edge is visible to the querying user then the generated search results could include a reference to user 7. In particular embodiments the user node for the querying user does not necessarily need to be connected by a visible path to the node corresponding to the identified object however there should be at least a path between a node that is visible to the querying user a source node and the node. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior example the querying user does not necessarily need to be connected in a path to either user 4 or user 7 so long as the querying user can view a source node which may be user 5 in this case and so long as the querying user can view the path between user 5 and the nodes corresponding to users 4 and 7 then the nodes corresponding to these users may appear in the search results. The querying user may be able to view the source node for example because that node is publicly accessible or within a threshold degree of separation of the querying user. Although this disclosure describes enforcing privacy setting in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates enforcing privacy setting in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments in response to a search query received from a querying user social networking system may generate one or more search results where the search results correspond to the search query. Each search result may correspond to a node of the social graph . Social networking system may identify objects e.g. users photos profile pages or content of profile pages etc. that satisfy or otherwise match the search query. A search result corresponding to each identified object may then be generated. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the search query Photos of Matt and Stephanie social networking system may identify a photo where the user s Matt and Stephanie are both tagged in the photo. A search result corresponding to this photo may then be generated and sent to the user. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more search result corresponding to objects having a visibility that is visible to the querying user. As discussed above objects identified during indexing may be filtered based on the privacy settings of the objects. Each search result may correspond to one of the selected objects having a visibility that is visible to the querying user. Similarly privacy filtering may be used to exclude objects from the search results that have a visibility that is not visible to the querying user. Although this disclosure describes generating search results in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating search results in any suitable manner. More information on generating search results may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 939 filed 31 Dec. 2012 which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may send one or more search results to the querying user. The search results may be sent to the user for example in the form of a list of links on the search results webpage each link being associated with a different webpage that contains some of the identified resources or content. In particular embodiments each link in the search results may be in the form of a Uniform Resource Locator URL that specifies where the corresponding webpage is located and the mechanism for retrieving it. Social networking system may then send the search results webpage to the web browser on the user s client system . The user may then click on the URL links or otherwise select the content from the search results webpage to access the content from social networking system or from an external system such as for example third party system as appropriate. In particular embodiments each search result may include link to a profile page and a description or summary of the profile page or the node corresponding to that page . The search results may be presented and sent to the querying user as a search results page. When generating the search results social networking system may generate one or more snippets for each search result where the snippets are contextual information about the target of the search result i.e. contextual information about the social graph entity profile page or other content corresponding to the particular search result . In particular embodiments social networking system may only send search results having a score rank over a particular threshold score rank. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may only send the top ten results back to the querying user in response to a particular search query. Although this disclosure describes sending particular search results in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates sending any suitable search results in any suitable manner.
