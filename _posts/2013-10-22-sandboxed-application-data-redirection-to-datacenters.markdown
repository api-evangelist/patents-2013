title: Sandboxed application data redirection to datacenters
abstract: Technologies are generally described to redirect data from application sandboxes to datacenters. In some examples, an application operating in an application sandbox may exchange data with an application data store, such as a file or a directory, also located in the sandbox. The data store may then exchange data with a datacenter at a particular geographic locale over a network connection established by a sandbox data servicer module. The network connection may be periodically updated to connect the data store with different datacenters at different geographic locales based on geographic information associated with the application, a device on which the application executes, the datacenters, and/or the exchanged data.

This Application is the National Stage filing under 35 US.C. 371 of PCT Application Ser. No. PCT US13 66242 filed on Oct. 22 2013. The PCT application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Unless otherwise indicated herein the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

The placement and management of geospatial data or data associated with specific geographic locations has come into focus as use of mobile devices and cloud services become more widespread. Geospatial data may be available from numerous sources in many diverse and heterogeneous formats and structures and may be compiled using various geospatial data collection techniques. As such it may be desirable to assure that the various sources of potential geospatial data such as user applications interact with the geographically appropriate datacenters.

Geospatial data processing and management although fairly complicated may be reasonably implemented by large companies with their commensurate resources. However user application developers are becoming smaller as application development becomes easier and simpler. Such smaller developers may lack the resources larger companies do and may find it difficult to take advantage of geospatial data processing.

The present disclosure generally describes techniques to redirect data from application sandboxes to datacenters.

According to some examples methods are provided to redirect data from an application sandbox to datacenters. An example method may include executing an application in an application sandbox at a first device and establishing a network connection between a sandboxed data store in the application sandbox and a first datacenter at a first geographic location. The method may further include exchanging a first data between the application and the sandboxed data store and exchanging the first data between the sandboxed data store and the first datacenter via the network connection.

According to other examples devices are provided to redirect data from an application sandbox to datacenters. An example device may include a memory a sandboxing module configured to provide an application sandbox and a sandboxed data store in the memory and a processing module. The processing module may be configured to execute an application in the application sandbox and establish a network connection between the sandboxed data store and a first datacenter at a first geographic location. The processing module may be further configured to exchange a first data between the application and the sandboxed data store and exchange the first data between the sandboxed data store and the first datacenter via the network connection.

According to further examples methods are provided for geo spatial load balancing and data management across datacenters. An example method may include receiving application information associated with an application being executed in a device sandbox determining based on the application information and geospatial information associated with multiple datacenters a destination datacenter selected from the multiple datacenters and updating the application based on the destination datacenter.

According to yet further examples a geo manager module is provided to redirect data from application sandboxes to datacenters. The geo manager module may include a memory configured to store geospatial information associated with multiple datacenters and a processing module. The processing module may be configured to receive application information associated with an application being executed in a device sandbox determine based on the application information and the geospatial information a destination datacenter selected from the multiple datacenters and provide an update for the application based on the destination datacenter.

The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects embodiments and features described above further aspects embodiments and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof. In the drawings similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description drawings and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. The aspects of the present disclosure as generally described herein and illustrated in the Figures can be arranged substituted combined separated and designed in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.

This disclosure is generally drawn inter alia to methods apparatus systems devices and or computer program products related to redirection of data from application sandboxes to datacenters.

Briefly stated technologies are generally described to redirect data from application sandboxes to datacenters. In some examples an application operating in an application sandbox may exchange data with an application data store such as a file or a directory also located in the sandbox. The data store may then exchange data with a datacenter at a particular geographic locale over a network connection established by a sandbox data servicer module. The network connection may be periodically updated to connect the data store with different datacenters at different geographic locales based on geographic information associated with the application a device on which the application executes the datacenters and or the exchanged data.

A datacenter as used herein refers to an entity that hosts services and applications for customers through one or more physical server installations and one or more virtual machines executed in those server installations. Customers of the datacenter also referred to as tenants may be organizations that provide access to their services for multiple users.

As shown in a diagram a physical datacenter may include one or more physical servers and each of which may be configured to provide one or more virtual machines . For example the physical servers and may be configured to provide four virtual machines and two virtual machines respectively. In some embodiments one or more virtual machines may be combined into one or more virtual datacenters. For example the four virtual machines provided by the server may be combined into a virtual datacenter . The virtual machines and or the virtual datacenter may be configured to provide cloud related data computing services such as various applications data storage data processing or comparable ones to a group of customers such as individual users or enterprise customers via a cloud .

As described above many application developers may lack the resources to take advantage of geospatial data processing. To address this issue entities that have the resources to perform geospatial data processing such as the large companies mentioned above may provide geospatial data interfaces configured to couple to individual applications. Sandboxed data files or directories associated with individual applications may then serve as data pipes for transferring data between the individual applications and various datacenters through these geospatial data interfaces. As a result application developers who wish to build applications that take advantage of geospatial data processing may not need to deal with the complexities involved in geospatial data management. Instead application developers may rely on the expertise of larger geospatial data service providers. Moreover since sandboxing can be implemented at the operating system level instead of the application level any given application may be provided with geospatial data processing capability simply by executing the application on a device with an operating system that supports sandboxing. Even older or legacy software applications not originally designed for network based interactions may be provided with geospatial data processing simply by executing them on a platform that provides sandboxing.

According to a diagram a computing device such as a desktop or mobile computer a tablet computer a smartphone or any other suitable computing device may execute a number of different applications. In some embodiments the computing device may execute an individual application in an application sandbox. As used herein an application sandbox may refer to a set of controls that determines what a particular application can do in a system and may be implemented at the operating system level or the application level. For example the operating system of the computing device may implement an application sandbox to limit an application s access to files preferences network resources and or hardware at the computing device . In the diagram the computing device may execute a first application in a first application sandbox a second application in a second application sandbox and a third application in a third application sandbox . Each of the application sandboxes and may include the associated application as well as any files or memory locations that the associated application can access. For example the first application sandbox may include a first application directory that contains the first application as well as a documents directory a library directory and a temporary directory . In other examples some or all of these elements may be kept separate for example the operating system may keep executable application outside sandbox to prevent the application changing its executable code.

In some embodiments application sandboxing may allow each application on a computing device to see the same file structure but actually have each application interact with different sandboxed versions of the various directories or data files. For example both the first application in the first application sandbox and the second application in the second application sandbox may have access to a documents directory. However the first application may write to and read from its own version of the documents directory the documents directory and the second application may access its own different version of the documents directory located in the second application sandbox . The different versions of the directories may in fact be virtual data stores in system memory or storage managed by the operating system of the computing device . As a result any given sandboxed application may only modify data and settings within its own sandbox and may not modify data and settings belonging to other applications on the computing device .

As shown in a diagram the computing device may execute the first application in the first application sandbox . During execution the first application may have read write access to one or more sandbox directories or data files . For example the directories files may include the documents directory the library directory the temporary directory and or any other suitable directories or files. Since the directories files are sandbox directories files the device may treat the directories files as virtual data stores and may isolate data written to the directories files by the first application from other directories or files at the device .

As mentioned above sandboxed directories or data files associated with a sandboxed application may serve as data pipes coupling the sandboxed application to various datacenters for geospatial data processing and management. In some embodiments a geo manager module may provide geospatial data management for the device . The geo manager module may manage multiple datacenters such as a first datacenter a second datacenter and or a third datacenter each located in a different geographic locale. In some embodiments the geo manager module may be located or implemented at one of the datacenters or at an entirely separate location. As part of the geospatial data management process the geo manager module may determine a suitable destination datacenter for geospatial data from the device or the first application based on one or more parameters. For example the geo manager module may select one of the datacenters or as a destination datacenter for the device or the first application based on the geographic location of the device the first application and or the datacenters or . In some embodiments the geo manager module may select the destination datacenter based on a type or contents of the geospatial data to be transferred.

To establish the actual connection between the destination datacenter and the device and or first application the geo manager module may communicate with a sandbox data servicer being executed at the device . For example the geo manager module may provide information about the destination datacenter to the sandbox data servicer . The destination datacenter information may be provided in the form of an application programming interface API message a JavaScript Object Notation JSON object an Extensible Markup Language XML object and or any other suitable message or object. The sandbox data servicer may then establish network connections for data exchange between the sandbox directories files and the datacenters and . For example the sandbox data servicer may be configured to establish connections between the directories files and one or more of the datacenters and via a network represented by the cloud . Subsequently all or some data written to the sandbox directories files by the first application may be transferred via the established network connections to the appropriate destination datacenter where geospatial data processing and management may occur. Data may also be written to the sandbox directories files by the destination datacenter via the network connections for the first application to read. This may allow application developers to take advantage of geospatial data processing and management provided by other entities merely by implementing or using application sandboxes. In some embodiments the data transferred over the network connections in either or both directions may be encrypted or otherwise secured to provide additional security.

As described above the sandbox data servicer may establish a network connection between a destination datacenter and the sandbox directories files associated with one application on the device and different applications may be connected to different datacenters. In some embodiments sandbox directories files associated with multiple applications may be connected to the same destination datacenter. In other embodiments one sandbox directory file associated with an application may be connected to one destination datacenter while another sandbox directory file associated with the same application may be connected to another destination datacenter. Some sandboxed directories files may not be connected to any datacenters and may remain isolated. For example the sandboxed directories files associated with a particular application executing on the device may not be connected to any datacenters. In some embodiments some sandboxed directories files associated with an application may be connected to datacenters and other sandboxed directories files associated with the same application may be isolated from all datacenters.

In some embodiments a geo manager module operating in conjunction with the sandbox data servicer may periodically update the network connections between the sandboxed directories files and the various datacenters. The network connections may be updated if one or more parameters associated with the device the applications executing on the device the data being exchanged over the network connection the cloud and or the datacenters and change. For example network connections may be updated when the device moves to a different geographic location when the device begins or halts execution of one or more applications when the type format or content of data being exchanged changes and or when datacenters come online or go offline. The geo manager module may update the network connections by providing updated destination datacenter information to the sandbox data servicer in the form of an API message a JSON XML object or in any other suitable format. Subsequently the sandbox data servicer may update network connections from the sandboxed directories files to reflect the updated destination datacenter information. For example in response to receiving updated destination datacenter information indicating the second datacenter as the new destination the sandbox data servicer may change a network connection ending at the first datacenter to end at the second datacenter .

In some embodiments ongoing communication between the sandboxed directories files and the original destination datacenter may be maintained during a switch to the updated destination datacenter. For example the sandboxed directories files may initially communicate with the first datacenter in a first session. As the network connection is updated to end at the second datacenter instead of the first datacenter the sandbox data servicer may maintain the same first session such that the datacenter switch is transparent to the sandboxed directories files . In some embodiments the geo manager module may assist in maintaining the first session by sending keys or session information when providing network connection updates.

The process may begin at an operation TRANSFER SANDBOX DATA TO FROM SELECTED DATACENTER where a sandbox data servicer module e.g. the sandbox data servicer may transfer data between a sandboxed data store e.g. the sandboxed directories files and a selected destination datacenter. At a next operation NEW CONNECTION UPDATE a sandbox data servicer module e.g. the sandbox data servicer may determine whether a new connection update has been received. For example the sandbox data servicer module may receive new connection updates from a geo manager module e.g. the geo manager module based on parameter changes associated with the application device and or datacenters. In response to determining that no new connection updates have been received the sandbox data servicer module may return to the operation and continue transferring data between the sandboxed data store and the selected destination datacenter.

On the other hand in response to determining that a new connection update has been received at a next operation RECEIVE NEW CONNECTION INFORMATION the sandbox data servicer module may receive the new connection information for example in the form of an API message a JSON XML object or any other suitable message or object. At a next operation SET UP NEW NETWORK CONNECTION the sandbox data servicer module may set up the new network connection based on the received new connection information. For example the sandbox data servicer module may update a network connection to end at a new destination datacenter. Subsequently the sandbox data servicer module may return to the operation and continue transferring data between the sandboxed data store and the newly updated destination datacenter.

The process may begin at an operation DECIDE WHICH DATACENTER APPLICATION DATA TO BE SENT TO where a geo manager module e.g. the geo manager may decide which datacenter data from a particular application associated with a particular user should be sent to. The geo manager module may perform the decision based on one or more parameters associated with the application the user the data and or the datacenters such as geographic location data type format content time network traffic datacenter status and or any other suitable parameters. Subsequently at an operation UPDATE SANDBOX DATA SERVICE CONNECTION the geo manager module may update the sandbox data service connection. For example the geo manager module may provide a network connection update with new destination datacenter information to a sandbox data servicer module e.g. the sandbox data servicer at the device executing the application.

At a next operation DONE WITH USER the geo manager module may determine whether the user has any other applications to update. In response to determining that the user has at least one other application to update at an operation NEXT APPLICATION the geo manager module may switch to the next un updated application then again iterate through the operations . In response to determining that the user does not have any other application to update at an operation DONE WITH ALL USERS the geo manager module may determine if any other users have applications to update. In response to determining that there is at least one other user with applications to update at an operation NEXT USER the geo manager may switch to the next user with un updated applications then again iterate through the operations . On the other hand in response to determining that no other users have applications to update at an operation GEO MANAGEMENT STATE CHANGED the geo manager module may determine if geo management state has been changed. For example geo management state may change in response to users leaving or joining new applications starting users moving running applications stopping network load balancing changes geospatial data processing changes or any other change in the geo manager module operating environment. In response to determining that geo management state has changed the geo manager module may again iterate through the operations . On the other hand in response to determining that geo management state has not changed the geo manager module may again check if geo management state has changed at a later time.

However those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein in whole or in part may be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits as one or more computer programs executing on one or more computers e.g. as one or more programs executing on one or more computer systems as one or more programs executing on one or more processors e.g. as one or more programs executing on one or more microprocessors as firmware or as virtually any combination thereof and that designing the circuitry and or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure.

The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure in addition to those enumerated herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

In addition those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include but are not limited to the following a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk a hard disk drive a Compact Disc CD a Digital Versatile Disk DVD a digital tape a computer memory a solid state drive etc. and a transmission type medium such as a digital and or an analog communication medium e.g. a fiber optic cable a waveguide a wired communications link a wireless communication link etc. .

Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and or processes in the fashion set forth herein and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and or processes into data processing systems. That is at least a portion of the devices and or processes described herein may be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a data processing system may include one or more of a system unit housing a video display device a memory such as volatile and non volatile memory processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors computational entities such as operating systems drivers graphical user interfaces and applications programs one or more interaction devices such as a touch pad or screen and or control systems including feedback loops and control motors e.g. feedback for sensing position and or velocity of gantry systems control motors to move and or adjust components and or quantities .

A data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components such as those found in data computing communication and or network computing communication systems. The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within or connected with different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary and that in fact many other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively associated such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality may be seen as associated with each other such that the desired functionality is achieved irrespective of architectures or intermediate components. Likewise any two components on associated may also be viewed as being operably connected or operably coupled to each other to achieve the desired functionality and any two components capable of being so associated may also be viewed as being operably couplable to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically connectable and or physically interacting components and or wirelessly interactable and or wirelessly interacting components and or logically interacting and or logically interactable components.

With respect to the use of substantially any plural and or singular terms herein those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and or application. The various singular plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.

It will be understood by those within the art that in general terms used herein and especially in the appended claims e.g. bodies of the appended claims are generally intended as open terms e.g. the term including should be interpreted as including but not limited to the term having should be interpreted as having at least the term includes should be interpreted as includes but is not limited to etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example as an aid to understanding the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases at least one and one or more to introduce claim recitations. However the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles a or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases one or more or at least one and indefinite articles such as a or an e.g. a and or an should be interpreted to mean at least one or one or more the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number e.g. the bare recitation of two recitations without other modifiers means at least two recitations or two or more recitations .

Furthermore in those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B and C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B and C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms whether in the description claims or drawings should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms either of the terms or both terms. For example the phrase A or B will be understood to include the possibilities of A or B or A and B. 

As will be understood by one skilled in the art for any and all purposes such as in terms of providing a written description all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves thirds quarters fifths tenths etc. As anon limiting example each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third middle third and upper third etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as up to at least greater than less than and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. Finally as will be understood by one skilled in the art a range includes each individual member. Thus for example a group having 1 3 cells refers to groups having 1 2 or 3 cells. Similarly a group having 1 5 cells refers to groups having 1 2 3 4 or 5 cells and so forth.

While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The various aspects and embodiments disclosed herein are for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.
