The systems and methods described herein relate to the power efficient measurement of physical activity with a wearable sensor. More particularly the systems and methods described herein enable the continuous activity tracking without compromising battery life. In some implementations the wearable sensor detects movement and enters predefined power states responsive to the type of movement detected.

According to one aspect of the disclosure a method for efficiently measuring physical activity with a wearable device includes waking the wearable device from a low power state. The method also includes obtaining one or more data points of a motion signal using a motion sensor of the wearable device at a first point in time with a first frequency. The method also includes determining if the one or more data points are above a first threshold and then obtaining for a predetermined amount of time and at a second frequency one or more additional data points of the motion signal responsive to the one or more data points being above the first threshold.

In some implementations the method includes obtaining only one data point from the motion signal and then determining an orientation of the wearable device responsive to the one data point. In some implementations a second data point is obtained from the motion signal after pausing for a second predetermined amount of time.

In some implementations determining if the one or more data points are above the first threshold includes determining if each of the first data point and the second data point are above the first threshold.

In some implementations the wearable device switches to the low power state and to sampling the motion signal at the first frequency at the end of the predetermined amount of time.

In some implementations the method further includes comparing a subset of samples sampled at the second frequency to a second threshold and switching to the low power state if a predetermined number of the samples in the subset of samples are not greater than the second threshold. In some implementations the second frequency is greater than the first frequency.

The battery can supply between about 1.5 V and 9 V to the processor and or other components of the wearable sensor . In some implementations the battery lasts about 1 3 2 5 4 10 or 7 14 days before needing replacement or recharging. In other implementations the battery can last 2 6 months 3 9 months 8 12 months or 1 3 years without replacement or recharging. In some implementations the battery may be a rechargeable battery.

In some implementations the wearable sensor and or base stations can determine the relative strength of the wireless connection between the wearable sensor and base station . Using the relative strengths of the wireless connections the relative position of the wearable sensor can be determined. In some implementations the relative strengths of the wireless connection is determined responsive to a received signal strength indication RSSI or a link quality indication LQI . In some implementations the relative position of the wearable sensor can be determined using 1 2 3 4 5 or more base stations . For example a user may have a first base station located in their bedroom and a second base station located in their living room. When the user and wearable sensor are in the user s bedroom the first base station may have a relatively stronger connection to the wearable sensor when compared to the second base station . Responsive to the relative connection strengths between the wearable sensor and first base station and wearable sensor and the second base station it can be determined that the user and wearable sensor are located in the user s bedroom. In some implementations a distribution of the RSSI and LQI within the environment can be modeled. Applying the wearable sensor s current wireless connection strength the location of the wearable sensor can be predicted using for example a particle filter.

Aspects of the operating environments and components described above will become apparent in the context of the systems and methods disclosed herein.

The housing houses the components described above in relation to . The above described sensors may be internal and or external to the housing . For example the wearable sensor may include an accelerometer which need not be exposed to the outside environment. In another example the wearable sensor may include an ambient light sensor that is exposed to the outside environment such that it can measure the light levels. Similarly the wearable sensor may include a galvanic response sensor on the bottom surface of the housing . The galvanic sensor may make contact with a user s skin and be configured to determine when it is in contact with a user s skin and when it is not in contact with a user s skin.

As illustrated the wearable sensor includes a button . In some implementations the wearable sensor includes a plurality of buttons and or a screen. In some implementations the screen is a touch screen. A user may use the bottom to mark events. For example a user may mark the beginning of physical activity. In some implementations the button is coupled to an input on the above described processor . When the button is depressed the processor may mark the event. For example the processor may store a time stamp of when the button was depressed in the storage device .

In some implementations the wearable sensor includes medical alert functionality. The button may be used to request help or to send an alert that a medical incident is occurring. For example if the user falls the user may press the button and the wearable sensor may send an alert to the client device of a care taker.

In some implementations the functionality of a button and or screen located on the wearable sensor is achieved through a client device . For example a user s smart phone may run an application that corresponds to the wearable sensor . The application may be in communication with the wearable sensor through a data connection on the phone and wearable sensor . The application may provide the user with information relevant to the wearable sensor . In some implementations the application may enable the user to activate features on the wearable sensor as if the user was depressing a physical button on the wearable sensor . For example the wearable sensor may include an activity button that when activated causes the wearable sensor to mark a time stamp indicating when the activity button was depressed in the application.

The wearable sensor may be designed and constructed to have a predetermined shape or form that provides a predetermined orientation when the wearable sensor is lying at rest falls and lies at rest or is placed down by the wearer on a surface. In some implementations the wearable sensor is configured such that when not worn it defaults to a particular orientation. For example the top of the housing may be dome shaped and weighted to one side. When not worn the wearable sensor may lean to the weighted side also referred to as the wearable sensor s default orientation . When the wearable sensor or other device in the environment detects the default orientation the wearable sensor may determine that it is not being worn.

In some implementations basing the detection of movement on orientation enables sampling at a relatively lower sampling rate when compared to basing the detection of movement on acceleration. The line indicates an acceleration signal of the same wearable sensor . As illustrated the acceleration signal is relatively steady except for during epochs of large movement. However to capture the rapid change in accelerations the sampling frequency must be high enough to accurately recreate the signal. For example if a sample is only recoded at t t and t far below the Nyquist frequency of the acceleration signal then the acceleration signal would appear flat throughout the recording and it would appear as if no movement occurred. However sampling at t t and t provides data points with substantially different orientation values and thus movement information may be determined from low sampled orientation data.

The systems and methods described herein relate to the power efficient measurement of physical activity with a wearable sensor. More particularly the systems and methods described herein enable the continuous activity tracking without compromising battery life. In some implementations the wearable sensor detects movement and enters predefined power states responsive to the type of movement detected.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention described in this disclosure. For example the methods described herein may be included in as a module that is added to an already available wearable sensor or custom built wearable sensor such as the wearable sensor described herein.

As set forth above the wearable sensor can include a plurality of sensors . In some implementations the wearable sensor sets its power state responsive to a detection of movement or physical activity. The movement may be based on the wearable sensor s orientation and or acceleration. The signal generated by the sensor in response to detecting physical activity can be referred to as a motion signal. In some implementations the orientation of the wearable sensor is derived from the motion signal by measuring the gravitational acceleration along the x y and z axis. The accelerometers can be configured to detect subtle movements such as those that are difficult to spot with the naked eye. For example the sensor may detect movements that are caused by a user breathing or chewing. In some implementations the sensors can detect orientation to within 1 degree 0.5 degrees or 0.01 degrees. In addition to movement and as described above the wearable sensor may detect medical conditions of the wearer such as but not limited to temperature pulse rate and blood pressure. In some implementations the sensors can include altimeter sensors and or frequency modulation FM tuners.

In some implementations the processor samples the signal generated by the sensors at less than 10 Hz. In some implementations a sampling frequency less than 10 Hz is referred to as a low sampling frequency and a sampling frequency about 10 Hz is referred to as a high sampling frequency. The processor can sample the signal at about 1 5 Hz about 3 7 Hz or about 6 10 Hz. In some implementations the processor samples the motion signal once per time step wherein a time step can be 1 min 5 min or 10 min. In some implementations the processor samples the signal above 10 Hz. For example the processor can sample the signal at about 10 50 Hz about 50 100 Hz about 100 200 Hz or about 200 1000 Hz.

The wearable sensor also includes a movement detection module . The movement detection module is responsible for detecting and determining when the wearable sensor moves. The movement detection module can be configured to detect and measure movements associated with physical activity e.g. walking and exercising sleep and non physical activity e.g. sedentary activity or eating . In some implementations the movements detection module includes processor executable instructions that are stored in the storage device or within the processor .

In some implementations the detection module detects movement or activity responsive to the orientation of the wearable sensor as determined by one or more sensors . The orientation of the wearable sensor at each sampled data point of the motion signal may be determined using the below equations 

In the above equations Grepresents the measured acceleration along the x y and z axes. In some implementations the motion signal is filtered with a low pass filter to substantially isolate the acceleration due to gravity. The low pass filter can remove the component of the motion signal due to movement leaving substantially only the component caused by gravity.

In some implementations the measured acceleration may be used to determine both an orientation and an intensity. In some implementations the intensity of the motion signal is the raw magnitude of the motion signal. In other implementations intensity of the motion signal is a derived value that can be calculated from the raw motion signal. For example the intensity value can be the sum of the absolute value of the differential of the samples in the motion signal. More particularly the intensity can be represented by the equation 1 where I is the intensity of the motion signal and x n is the sampled motion signal at sample n.

In a similar implementations the intensity value can be the sum of the absolute value of the samples in the motion signal and a running average. More particularly the intensity can be represented by the equation MA where I is the intensity of the motion signal and x n is the sampled motion signal at sample n. MAis the moving average over the last x samples of the motion signal.

In some implementations the movement detection module determines if movement occurred responsive to an intensity or orientation crossing a threshold. For example the movement detection module may count the number of times the intensity rose above a first threshold within the time step. If the number is above a second threshold the movement detection module may inform the power management module that movement occurred during the time step. In some implementations a predetermined number of consecutive samples recorded during the time step have to cross the first threshold for the motion detection module to indicate that a motion was detected.

Referring back to the wearable sensor also includes a power management module . In general the power management module automatically sets the wearable sensor s power state to one of the plurality of power states . As illustrated in the power management module includes a low power state a mid power state and a high power state. In some implementations each of the low power state mid power state and high power state can have a plurality of sub states. For example the low power state may include a default low power state and a deep low power state which the power management module enables if the movement detection module has not detected movement in a predetermined amount of time.

In some implementations as illustrated in movement data e.g. wearable sensor orientation or acceleration can include brief intervals of activity surrounded by long segments of sedentary or low activity. As described in greater detail below the power management module can detect and classify movement and place the wearable sensor in a lower power state during periods of substantially sedentary movement. The power management module can also place the wearable sensor in a high power state during periods of active movement. In some implementations the mid power state is an intermediate state during which time the power management module determines if it should fully enter the high power state.

In some implementations the power management module classifies the movement data with a pattern recognition algorithm. The pattern recognition algorithm can be a decision tree classifier artificial neural network support vector machine or Hidden Markov model. The classifiers may be trained through supervised or unsupervised learning. The classification by the algorithm can be responsive to the variance entropy frequency components energy or any combination thereof of the movement data. In some implementations additional data such as a location or orientation may be used to classify the data.

In some implementations the low power state is a sleep state. In the lower power state the processor can be set to a sleep or idle power state wherein the wearable sensor may consume a negligent amount of energy. In some implementations one or more of the sensors are turned off or the processor does not sample motion data from the sensors .

In some implementations the mid power state is also referred to the slope sense state. In the slope sense state the movement detection module monitors motion data captured via the sensors to determine movement has or is occurring . In some implementations the movement must be above a predetermined threshold before the movement detection module determines movement has occurred. For example the movement detection module may not indicate to the power management module that movement was detected if the movement detection module detects small movements such as those occurring when a user of the wearable sensor breaths.

In some implementations the wearable sensor wakes form the low power state to the mid power state at predetermined intervals. For example the wearable sensor may enter the slope sense state about every 5 60 seconds 30 120 seconds 1 3 minutes 2 5 minutes 5 10 minutes or 10 30 minutes to determine if movement of the wearable sensor is occurring. In some implementations the wearable sensor samples the motion signal once when waking from the low power state. For example the wearable sensor may sample the movement signal once every one minute to determine the wearable sensor s orientation. In another example the wearable sensor may sample the motion single for a predetermined length of time when waking from the low power state. For example the wearable sensor may sample the motion signal for 2 second every 1 minute to determine the intensity of the wearable sensor s movement. During the mid power state the wearable sensor may activate a subset of the plurality of sensors . In some implementations if substantially no motion is detected the wearable sensor may reenter the low power state.

In some implementations during the high power state the processor samples the motion signal at a higher relative frequency compared to the sampling frequency of the mid power state. For example the wearable sensor may sample one or more motion signals at a about 10 20 Hz 15 50 Hz 40 100 Hz or over 100 Hz. In some implementations in the high power state the wearable sensor activates a greater number of sensors relative to the number of sensors activated in the mid power state. In some implementations the wearable sensor enables all the sensors within the wearable sensor .

At step the wearable sensor wakes from the sleep or low power state. In some implementations at the expiration of t a clock wakes the processor of the wearable sensor via an interrupt. In other implementations the waking of the wearable sensor may occur responsive to a movement. For example the wearable sensor may include a sensor coupled to an interrupt channel of the processor such that the sensor can wake the processor or wearable sensor via the interrupt responsive to the detection of a movement.

At step the wearable sensor obtains data from a motion signal at a first frequency. At step the wearable sensor is in the above described mid power or slope sense state. In some implementations the wearable sensor measures the motion signal for a predetermined time t. The duration of tcan be about 0 2 seconds in duration. During the mid power state the wearable sensor may record a single sample from the motion signal. In some implementations the wearable sensor samples the motion signal infrequently or at a low sampling frequency e.g. less than 10 Hz . The wearable sensor may save the data recorded during the mid power state to a storage device within the wearable sensor.

At step the movement detection module of the wearable sensor determines if movement occurred during step . In some implementations the movement detection module determines if the detected movement is above a predetermined threshold. In some implementations the threshold is set to V. In some implementations at least N samples recorded during the step have to be above V for the movement detection module to determine that motion occurred during step .

In some implementations the values of V and N are set responsive to the wearer of the wearable sensor. For example the values V and N can be set responsive to a wearer s age height ethnicity overall activity level sex health condition or any combination thereof. In some implementations the values of V and N are calibrated response to motion signals or other data previously collected on the wearable sensor. In some implementations the V and N parameters are set using an optimization algorithm that enables the wearer s physical activity to be characterized while substantially optimizing the power consumption of the wearable sensor. For example a gradient descent algorithm may be used. In this example the constraining variable can be the power consumption of the wearable sensor. In some implementations the parameters are selected to reduce the least squared error between the an activity count over a period T and an activity count that is substantially less than T. In some implementations the activity count can be the sum of the absolute values of the slopes of a motion signal. In some implementations the activity count can calculated by integrating the motion signal. A penalty factor can be applied to the algorithm if the power consumption exceeds the set value.

In other implementations the values of t t V and N are contestants. For example tmay be about 30 60 seconds 1 3 min 3 5 min or 5 10 min tmay be about 0 5 seconds 5 25 seconds 25 60 seconds.

As described above in some implementations at step the wearable sensor records only one sample from the motion signal. The movement detection module may compare the orientation from the current time step or an orientation data point of a previous time step to determine if movement is occurring. If the difference between the present and past orientation samples is above a predetermined threshold the movement detection module may determine that movement has occurred and the wearable sensor may switch to a high power state.

At step if the movement detection module of the wearable sensor does not detect movement the wearable sensor may return to the sleep or low power state. In some implementations the wearable sensor returns to the sleep or low power state after saving the data recorded during to a storage device.

At step responsive to detecting movement the wearable sensor obtains data from the motion signal at a second frequency. The second frequency may be a frequency of 10 Hz or higher. The second frequency is higher than the first frequency used in step . At step the power management module may enable the high power state. In some implementations the wearable sensor may enable additional sensors or features of the processor. Measuring the motion signal at a relatively higher frequency may enable the wearable sensor to determine the orientation of the sensor and the intensity of the motion signal as described above.

The wearable sensor may obtain data at the second frequency for time t. In some implementations tis a predetermined amount of time. For example the wearable sensor may record motion data for about 1 5 second about 5 15 seconds about 10 30 seconds about 25 45 seconds or about 40 60 second. In some implementations tis about 1 3 min 3 5 min or about 5 10 min. In some implementations the wearable sensor resets tif movement is detected when sampling at the second frequency.

In some implementations the wearable sensor may also categorize the recorded motion signal along cut points i.e. at changes in the characteristics of the motion signal . Example categories can include sedentary activity light activity moderate activity vigorous activity and sleeping. In some implementations the wearable sensor can also identify specific activity such as going up or down stairs. In some implementations the wearable sensor may also determine the amount of time that a wearer of the wearable sensor was in each category. For example the wearable sensor may estimate the amount of time that the wearer sleeps each day. The wearable sensor may use additional information such as location to classify the recoded data. In some implementations the categorization of the recorded data is performed on the wearable sensor. In other implementations the categorization of the data occurs on a second device such as a server. The categorization of the data can be automatic or performed by a human such as a caretaker. As described above the power management module of the wearable sensor may use decision trees policies artificial neural network support vector machine Hidden Markov model Bayesian networks clustering algorithms or any combination thereof to categorize the data.

At step the wearable sensor returns to the sleep state. In some implementations the wearable sensor pauses for a predetermined amount of time prior to returning to a the sleep state. In some implementations the wearable sensor may return to the mid power state before fully returning to the sleep state.
