This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 670 300 filed on Jul. 11 2012 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

Conventional physical layer management PLM systems are typically designed to track connections that are made at a patch panel. That is historically conventional PLM systems have been patch panel centric and have not included functionality to track connections that are made at other types of devices and systems in a network. For example such PLM systems typically do not automatically track connections that are made at a switch router hub gateway access point server computer end user computer appliance computers such as network attached storage NAS devices and nodes of a storage area network SAN or other types of devices. Although there are management systems that are used to manage and collect information about such devices such management systems are typically separate from the PLM systems used to track connections made at a patch panel.

One embodiment is directed to a wall plate device including one or more jacks. Each jack includes a rear attachment point configured to couple to one or more communication paths for non service network traffic in a semi permanent manner. Each jack also includes a front attachment point configured to mate with a connector of a corresponding physical communication media and to couple such physical communication media to the one or more communication paths at the rear attachment point. Each jack also includes a media reading interface configured to interface with a PLM interface of a connector connected to the front attachment point. The wall plate device also includes a programmable processor coupled to each of the media reading interfaces and configured to access a storage device or other component of a connector connected to the front attachment point through the media reading interface to obtain physical layer management PLM information. The programmable processor is configured to communicate the PLM information to another device external to the wall plate device.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific illustrative embodiments. However it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical mechanical and electrical changes may be made. Furthermore the method presented in the drawing figures and the specification is not to be construed as limiting the order in which the individual steps may be performed. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense.

Although a particular number type and arrangement of network entities is shown in it should be understood than any number combination of types and arrangement of network entities can be used including more wall plate devices wall plate devices coupled to more than one other network entity etc. Examples of network entities include for example rack mounted connector assemblies such as patch panels distribution units and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media wall mounted connector assemblies such as boxes jacks wall plate devices also referred to as wall outlets and media converters for fiber and copper physical communication media and inter networking devices such as switches routers hubs repeaters gateways and access points . Examples of end user devices include without limitation computers peripherals such as printers copiers storage devices and scanners IP telephones end user routers end user switches access points e.g. wireless networked TVs set top boxes and other such end user devices.

The network entities are coupled together using physical communication media . Each communication media is a cable comprising one or more communication paths. The one or more communication paths can be formed by one or more fiber optics or one or more copper wires. As an example the physical communication media can be implemented using a simplex cable a hybrid cable a multi channel cable etc. Some physical communication media such as media and include a first connector terminating a first end of the one or more communication paths and a second connector terminating a second opposite end of the one or more communication paths. Other examples of communication media such as media can include a connector terminating a first end and a wall plate device terminating a second opposite end. In examples where the one or more communication paths are fiber optics the connectors can be corresponding passive optical connectors or an active optical module for converting between optical signals and electrical signals. In examples where the one or more communication paths are copper wires connectors can be a corresponding electrical connector. Some or all of the physical communication media is a connectorized media segment. As used herein a connectorized media segment is a segment of physical communication media that includes a connector at at least one end of the segment. The connectors are used to facilitate the easy and repeated attachment and unattachment of the media segment to a jack.

Examples of connectorized media segments include CAT 5 6 and 7 twisted pair cables having modular connectors or plugs attached to both ends in which case the front connectors are implemented using compatible modular jacks or optical cables having SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors in which case the front connectors are implemented using compatible SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors or adapters . The techniques described here can be used with other types of connectors including for example BNC connectors F connectors DSX jacks and plugs bantam jacks and plugs and MPO and MTP multi fiber connectors and adapters.

Example physical communication media include duplex fiber optic cable including one or more optical fibers. The one or more optical fibers can include single mode or multi mode fibers. The fiber optic cable can include a simplex cable duplex cable 12 fiber cable 24 fiber cable and other fiber optic cables such as hybrid fiber copper cables . Other example physical communication media include coaxial cable. Still other examples include multiple fiber cable including a multi fiber connector for example a suitable MPO or MTP connector at each end of such cable.

The patch panel is used to cross connect various network entities of the local area network and comprises a set of port not shown . Each port is associated with a respective jack on the front face of the patch panel into which a RJ 45 connector of a communication media can be inserted. Various ports of the patch panel can be connected to ports of the switch by connecting one or more communication mediums between the front jacks of the patch panel and jacks of the switch .

Each port is also associated with a respective rear termination point at which a horizontal run of a communication media can be terminated. Each port is configured to communicatively couple the jack associated with that port and any communication media inserted therein to the respective termination point and any horizontal run of communication media terminated thereat . In this way a patch cord inserted into the front jack of the port can be connected to the corresponding horizontal run of twisted pair cabling terminated at the corresponding rear termination point.

In the example shown in each horizontal run terminates at its other end at a wall plate device . Two types of wall plate devices are shown in .

One type of wall plate device shown in is a distribution wall plate device . The distribution wall plate device is coupled to the patch panel with the communication media e.g. a CAT 5 or CAT 6 cable . The distribution wall plate device includes a termination point at which a horizontal run of the communication media can be terminated. A first connector of the communication media is connected to a first jack of the patch panel and a second end of the communication media is attached to the termination point of the distribution wall plate device .

The distribution wall plate device also includes a plurality of jacks for example RJ 45 jacks and an ETHERNET hub or switch . The termination point for the horizontal run and each of the jacks are coupled to a respective port of the ETHERNET hub or switch . In this way each of the jacks is communicatively coupled to the horizontal run terminated at the termination point and the connectivity provided over the horizontal run can be shared by devices connected to the jacks . The distribution wall plate device also includes a suitable power supply or interface not shown for providing power to the ETHERNET hub or switch . Examples of ways of providing power to the ETHERNET hub or switch include using Power Over ETHERNET technology to provide power over the horizontal run of the communication media and or over one or more communication mediums connected to the jacks . Power can also be provided by connecting the distribution wall plate device to a conventional AC mains power outlet using an external or internal power adapter.

An end user device of the network is coupled to other network entities in the local area network by connecting one end of a physical communication media e.g. a CAT 5 or CAT 6 cable to the end user device and the other end of the communication media to one of the jacks of the distribution wall plate device . In this example the end user device comprises a wireless access point however any device capable of connecting to the jack and communicating over the network can be used. The wireless access point can be wireless coupled to another device .

Another type of wall plate device shown in is a conventional passive wall plate device . The passive wall plate device includes a termination point for a horizontal run of the communication media and a corresponding jack . The passive wall plate device is coupled to the patch panel with the communication media e.g. a CAT 5 or CAT 6 cable . A first connector at a first end of the communication media is connected to a first jack of the patch panel and a second end of the communication media is attached to a termination point of the passive wall plate device . Each conductor in the horizontal run of twisted pair cabling is electrically connected to a corresponding conductor in the jack . In this way the jack is communicatively coupled to the horizontal run terminated at the termination point and the connectivity provided over the horizontal run can be shared by any devices connected to the jack .

In the example shown in an end user device is connected to the local area network by connecting one end of a communication media e.g. a CAT 5 or CAT 6 cable to the end user device and the other end of the communication media to the jack of the passive wall plate device .

At least some of the network entities are designed for use with segments of physical communication media that have identifier and attribute information also referred to herein as PLM information stored in or on them.

The identifier and attribute information is stored in or on the segment of physical communication media in a manner that enables the stored information when the segment is attached to a jack to be read by a programmable processor associated with the network entity. Examples of PLM information that can be stored in or on a segment of physical communication media include without limitation an identifier that uniquely identifies that particular segment of physical communication media similar to an ETHERNET Media Access Control MAC address but associated with the physical communication media and or connector attached to the physical communication media a part number a plug or other connector type a cable or fiber type and length a serial number a cable polarity a date of manufacture a manufacturing lot number information about one or more visual attributes of physical communication media or a connector attached to the physical communication media such as information about the color or shape of the physical communication media or connector or an image of the physical communication media or connector and other information used by an Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system or inventory control system. PLM information can also include testing or media quality or performance information which for example can be the results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured. In other embodiments alternate or additional data is stored in or on the media segments .

Also as noted below in some embodiments the PLM information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated. For example the PLM information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media can be updated to include the results of testing that is performed when a segment of physical media is installed or otherwise checked. In another example such testing information is supplied to an aggregation point and stored in a data store maintained by the aggregation point . In another example the PLM information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media includes a count of the number of times that a connector attached to a segment of physical communication media has been inserted into jack . In such an example the count stored in or on the segment of physical communication media is updated each time the connector is inserted into jack . This insertion count value can be used for example for warranty purposes for example to determine if the connector has been inserted more than the number of times specified in the warranty or for security purposes for example to detect unauthorized insertions of the physical communication media .

In the particular embodiment shown in each of the jacks of the network entities comprises a respective media reading interface via which the respective programmable processor is able to determine if a physical communication media segment is attached to that jack and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information PLM information stored in or on the attached segment if such information is stored therein or thereon . The programmable processor associated with each network entity is communicatively coupled to each of the media reading interfaces using a suitable bus or other interconnect.

Each programmable processor is configured to execute software or firmware that causes the programmable processor to carry out various functions described below. Each programmable processor also includes suitable memory that is coupled to the programmable processor for storing program instructions and data. In general the programmable processor determines if a physical communication media segment is attached to a jack with which that processor is associated and if one is to read the identifier and attribute information PLM information stored in or on the attached physical communication media segment if the segment includes such information stored therein or thereon using the associated media reading interface.

Each programmable processor is also configured to communicate physical layer information to devices that are coupled to the IP network . The physical layer information PLI includes information about the network entities associated with that programmable processor also referred to here as device information as well as information about any segments of physical media attached to the jacks of those network entities also referred to here as PLM information The device information includes for example an identifier for each network entity a type identifier that identifies the network entity s type and jack priority information that associates a priority level with each jack. The PLM information includes identity and attribute information that the programmable processor has read from attached physical media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on it. The PLI may also include information about physical communication media that does not have identifier or attribute information stored in or on it. This latter type of PLI can be manually input at the time the associated physical media segments are attached to the network entity for example using a management application executing on the programmable processor that enables a user to configure and monitor the network entity .

The system includes functionality that enables the physical layer information that the network entities capture to be used by application layer functionality outside of traditional physical layer management application domain. That is the physical layer information is not retained in a PLM island used only for PLM purposes but is instead made available to other applications. In the particular embodiment shown in the system includes an aggregation point that is communicatively coupled to the network entities via the IP network .

The aggregation point includes functionality that obtains physical layer information from the network entities and other devices and stores the physical layer information in a data store.

The aggregation point can be used to receive physical layer information from various types of network entities that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media . Examples of such network entities are noted above. Also the aggregation point and aggregation functionality can also be used to receive physical layer information from other types of devices that have functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media . Examples of such devices include end user devices such as computers peripherals such as printers copiers storage devices and scanners and IP telephones that include functionality for automatically reading information stored in or on the segment of physical communication media.

The aggregation point can also be used to obtain other types of physical layer information. For example in this embodiment the aggregation point also obtains information about physical communication media segments that is not otherwise automatically communicated to an aggregation point . One example of such information is information about non connectorized physical communication media segments that do not otherwise have information stored in or on them that are attached to a network entity including for example information indicating which jacks of the devices are connected to which jacks of other devices in the network as well as media information about the segment . Another example of such information is information about physical communication media segments that are connected to devices that are not be able to read media information that is stored in or on the media segments that are attached to their jacks and or that are not able to communicate such information to the aggregation point for example because such devices do not include such functionality because such devices are used with media segments that do not have media information stored in or on them and or because bandwidth is not available for communicating such information to the aggregation point . In this example the information can include for example information about the devices themselves such as the devices MAC addresses and IP addresses if assigned to such devices information indicating which jacks of the devices are connected to which jacks of other devices in the network for example other network entities and information about the physical media attached to the jacks of the devices. This information can be provided to the aggregation point for example by manually entering such information into a file such as a spreadsheet and then uploading the file to the aggregation point for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. Such information can also for example be directly entered using a user interface provided by the aggregation point for example using a web browser .

The aggregation point can also obtain information about the layout of the building or buildings in which the network is deployed as well as information indicating where each network entity and physical media segment is located within the building. This information can be for example manually entered and verified for example using a web browser in connection with the initial installation of each of the various items. In one implementation such location information includes an X Y and Z location for each jack or other termination point for each physical communication media segment for example X Y and Z location information of the type specified in the ANSI TIA EIA 606 A Standard Administration Standard For The Commercial Telecommunications Infrastructure .

The aggregation point can obtain and maintain testing media quality or performance information relating to the various segments of physical communication media that exist in the network. The testing media quality or performance information for example can be results of testing that is performed when a particular segment of media is manufactured and or when testing is performed when a particular segment of media is installed or otherwise checked.

The aggregation point also includes functionality that provides an interface for external devices or entities to access the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point . This access can include retrieving information from the aggregation point as well as supplying information to the aggregation point . In this embodiment the aggregation point is implemented as middleware that is able to provide such external devices and entities with transparent and convenient access to the PLI. Because the aggregation point aggregates PLI from the relevant devices on the IP network and provides external devices and entities with access to such PLI the external devices and entities do not need to individually interact with all of the devices in the IP network that provide PLI nor do such devices need to have the capacity to respond to requests from such external devices and entities.

The aggregation point in the embodiment shown in implements an application programming interface API by which application layer functionality can gain access to the physical layer information maintained by the aggregation point using a software development kit SDK that describes and documents the API.

Any other portion of the IP network is typically implemented using one or more inter networking devices. As noted above an inter networking device is a type of network entity and can be configured to read PLM information that is stored in or on the segments of physical media that are attached to its jacks and to communicate the PLM information it reads from the attached segments of media as well as information about the inter networking device itself to the aggregation point like any other network entity described here.

The aggregation point can be implemented on a standalone network node for example a standalone computer running appropriate software or can be integrated along with other network functionality for example integrated with an element management system or network management system or other network server or network element . Moreover the functionality of the aggregation point can be distribute across many nodes and devices in the network and or implemented for example in a hierarchical manner for example with many levels of aggregation points .

Moreover the aggregation point and the network entities are configured so that the aggregation point can automatically discover and connect with the network entities that provide PLI to an aggregation point that are on the network . In this way when network entities that are able to provide PLI to an aggregation point are coupled to the IP network an aggregation point is able to automatically discover the network entities and start aggregating physical layer information for that network entity without requiring the person installing the network entity to have knowledge of the aggregation points that are on the IP network . Similarly when an aggregation point is coupled to the IP network the aggregation point is able to automatically discover and interact with devices that are capable of providing PLI to an aggregation point without requiring the person installing the aggregation point to have knowledge of the devices that are on the IP network . Thus the physical layer information resources described here can be easily integrated into the IP network .

The aggregation point can aggregate the PLI from the network entities and physical communication media to associate jacks of network entities e.g. patch panels with physical communication media. For example the PLI can be used to associate a given jack of a network entity with a give physical communication media and or a particular connector of the physical communication media. Aggregating the PLI can include aggregating multiple such associations to determine physical layer connections between devices.

More information about physical layer information and the aggregation point can be found in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 124 624 filed on Feb. 13 2009 titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS AND METHODS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 705 497 filed on Feb. 12 2010 titled AGGREGATION OF PHYSICAL LAYER INFORMATION RELATED TO A NETWORK both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The IP network can include one or more local area networks and or wide area networks including for example the Internet . As a result the aggregation point need not be located at the same site as the network entities.

Various conventional IP networking techniques can be used in deploying the system of . For example conventional security protocols can be used to secure communications if they are communicated over a public or otherwise unsecure communication channel such as the Internet or over a wireless communication link .

In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each network entity each jack of each network entity and each media segment is individually addressable. Where IP addresses are used to individually address each network entity a virtual private network VPN dedicated for use with the various network entities can be used to segregate the IP addresses used for the network entities from the main IP address space that is used in the IP network .

In the particular embodiment shown in the system also supports conventional physical layer management PLM operations such as the tracking of moves adds and changes of the segments of physical media that are attached to the jacks of the network entities and providing assistance with carrying out moves adds and changes. PLI provided by the aggregation point can be used to improve upon conventional guided MAC processes. For example information about the location of the jack and the visual appearance for example the color or shape of the relevant physical media segment or connector attached thereto can be communicated to a technician to assist the technician in carrying out a move add or change. This information can be communicated to a computer or smartphone used by the technician. Moreover the PLI functionality that resides in the system can also be used to verify that a particular MAC was properly carried out by checking that the expected physical media segment is located in the expected jack . If that is not the case an alert can be sent to the technician so that the technician can correct the issue.

The PLM functionality included in the system can also support conventional techniques for guiding the technician in carrying out a MAC for example by illuminating one or more light emitting diodes LEDs to direct a technician to a particular network entity and or to a particular jack or by displaying messages on a liquid crystal display LCD included on or near the network entity. Other PLM functions include keeping historical logs about the media connected to the network entity.

In addition to network entities the techniques described here for reading PLM information stored in or on a segment of physical communication media can be used in one or more end user devices of the network. For example computers such as laptops servers desktop computers or special purpose computing devices such as IP telephones IP multi media appliances and storage devices can be configured to read PLM information that is stored in or on the segments of physical communication media that are attached to their jacks and to communicate the media information the read from the attached segments of media as well as information about the devices themselves to an aggregation point as described here.

In an example the wall plate devices can communicate PLI with the aggregation point along with non service network traffic over the communication media and respectively. As used herein non service network traffic is defined with respect to the wall plate devices such that network traffic destined for or originating from an end user device is non service network traffic. In some examples the wall plate devices can communicate PLI through a host server . In such examples the host server is communicatively coupled to each of the wall plate devices using appropriate physical communication media . The host server can be coupled to the LAN by connecting the host server to a corresponding communication media connected on the other end to a network entity e.g. patch panel . Notably the physical communication media used for communication with the host server is distinct from the communication media used for non service network traffic. Physical communication media however can be the same or a different type of communication media as the communication media . For example physical communication media can include CAT 5 6 and 7 twisted pair cables optical cables or coaxial cable.

The host server can be configured to communicate with the aggregation point over the LAN and more broadly the IP network . The host server can communicate PLI to from the aggregation point and also communicate PLI to from each wall outlet device . In this way the PLI from each wall outlet device can be provided to the aggregation point and the aggregation point can provide information and or commands to each wall outlet device . In some examples one or more of the wall outlet devices can communicative wirelessly as described in more detail below.

Each jack comprises a first attachment point and a second attachment point . The first attachment point is used to attach one or more communication paths to the jack and the second attachment point is used to attach a segment of physical communication media to the jack . The one or more communication paths can be part of the wall outlet device and connected to appropriate components within the wall outlet device or can be part of another communication media that is connected to another network entity e.g. patch panel at its other end.

In the particular embodiment shown in the first attachment point is located near the rear of the jack . As a consequence the first attachment point is also referred to here as the rear attachment point . Also in this embodiment the rear attachment point is configured to attach the one or more communication paths to the jack in a semi permanent manner. As used herein a semi permanent attachment is one that is designed to be changed relatively infrequently if ever. This is also referred to sometimes as a one time connection. Examples of suitable rear attachment points include punch down blocks in the case of copper physical media and fiber adapters fiber splice points and fiber termination points in the case of optical physical media .

In the embodiment shown in the second attachment point is located near the front of the jack . As a consequence the second attachment point is also referred to here as the front attachment point . In the embodiment shown in the front attachment point for each jack is designed for use with connectorized media segments that have identifier and attribute information stored in or on them. As used herein a connectorized media segment is a segment of physical communication media that includes a connector at at least one end of the segment. The front attachment point is implemented using a suitable connector or adapter that mates with the corresponding connector on the end of the media segment . The connector is used to facilitate the easy and repeated attachment and unattachment of the media segment to the jack . Examples of connectorized media segments include CAT 5 6 and 7 twisted pair cables having modular connectors or plugs attached to both ends in which case the front attachment point is implemented using compatible modular plugs or optical cables having SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors in which case the front attachment point is implemented using compatible SC LC FC LX.5 MTP or MPO connectors or adapters . The techniques described here can be used with other types of connectors including for example BNC connectors F connectors DSX jacks and plugs bantam jacks and plugs and MPO and MTP multi fiber connectors and adapters.

Each jack communicatively couples the respective rear attachment point to the respective front attachment point . As a result one or more communication paths attached to the respective rear attachment point are communicatively coupled to any media segment attached to the respective front attachment point . In one implementation each jack is designed for use with one or more communication paths and a media segment that comprise the same type of communication path s in which case each jack communicatively couples the one or more communication paths attached to the respective rear attachment point to any media segment attached to the respective front attachment point at the physical layer level without any media conversion. In other implementations each jack communicatively couples the one or more communication paths attached to the respective rear attachment point to any media segment attached to the respective front attachment point in other ways for example using a media converter if the rear one or more communication paths and the media segment comprise different types of communication paths .

As shown in the jack is configured for use with media segments that include a PLM interface that when the corresponding connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to a front attachment point of the jack communicatively couples a storage device or other component s to a corresponding media reading interface so that the associated programmable processor can obtain PLM information from the storage device or other component s . In one implementation of the embodiment shown in each connector itself houses the storage device or other component s and the PLM interface can be implemented by incorporating appropriate electrical contacts in the connector .

In another implementation of such an embodiment the storage device and other component s are housed within a housing that is separate from the connector . In such an implementation the housing is configured so that it can be snapped onto the media segment or the connector with the PLM interface positioned relative to the connector so that the PLM interface will properly mate with the media reading interface when the connector is inserted into or otherwise attached to the front attachment point .

Various examples of PLM interfaces are described in United States Patent Publication No. US 2011 0116748 filed Oct. 15 2010 and titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY IN FIBER OPTIC SYSTEMS AND METHODS THEREOF U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 025 841 filed on Feb. 11 2011 titled MANAGED FIBER CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 025 750 filed on Feb. 11 2011 titled COMMUNICATIONS BLADED PANEL SYSTEMS U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 124 624 filed on Feb. 13 2009 titled MANAGED CONNECTIVITY SYSTEMS AND METHODS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 705 497 filed on Feb. 12 2010 titled AGGREGATION OF PHYSICAL LAYER INFORMATION RELATED TO A NETWORK all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In some of these examples a four line PLM interface is used where the interface includes a single data line for reading and writing data a power line for providing power to the storage device a ground line for providing a ground level and an extra line reserved for future use. Also in these examples a storage device that supports the UNI O bus protocol is used where the UNI O bus protocol is used for communicating over the single data lead. One example of such a storage device and PLM interface are the storage devices and interfaces used in the QUAREOT family of physical layer management products that are commercially available from TE Connectivity.

The wall outlet also includes an active module that comprises a programmable processor that is coupled to a storage device. The programmable processor can include any suitable programmable processor such as a microprocessor e.g. an 8 bit microprocessor . The storage device can include for example an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM or other non volatile memory device. The programmable processor and the storage device can be the same die on separate dies or can be incorporated into a chip scale package.

The programmable processor can be configured to communicate with a storage device or other component in a communication media connected to a jack over a media reading interface of the respective jack . The media reading interface while the corresponding connector is inserted into a front attachment point of a jack communicatively couples the programmable processor to the corresponding PLM interface so that the programmable processor can access the storage device or other entity associated with the connector of the communication media .

The programmable processor is configured to obtain PLM information from communication media connected mated with jacks and send the PLM information to the host server . The programmable processor can also be configured to send PLI regarding itself to the host server as well as receiving information from the host server .

To implement the communications with the host server the active module can include a signaling circuit such as an RS 422 signaling circuit coupled via appropriate pulse transformers to a communication media which is connected at the other end to the host server . As such the signaling circuit can communicate with the host server using a serial communication scheme over the communicate media . The active module also includes a power supply unit that is coupled to the transformer for recovering power from the signals on the communication media and for supplying such recovered power to the programmable processor and signaling circuit as described in more detail below. The active module can also include a local input output port such as a UNIO port. Advantageously the wall outlet enables the non service traffic from all of its ports jacks to travel on paths e.g. communication media that are distinct from the paths of the service traffic e.g. communication media .

In the example shown in the host server can include a multiplex module e.g. a RS 422 MUX to multiplex demultiplex signals between the host server and the plurality of wall outlets . A programmable processor in the host server can transmit and receive signals from the plurality of wall outlets via the multiplex module . The programmable processor can also communicate with the aggregation point via the switch and IP network . In an example the programmable processor in the host server can act as a master and direct control of each slave processor in a wall outlet . Accordingly the master processor can instruct each slave processor to obtain PLM information from communication media connected to jacks of their respective wall outlets .

The host server can also include a power interface that can be coupled to a suitable power source e.g. DC power source . The multiplex module can be coupled to the power interface to simplex power and data over the communication media to each wall outlet . That power can be recovered from the communication media by the power supply unit in each wall outlet . In other examples conductors e.g. a power cable that are separate from the communication media can be used to provide power to each wall outlet .

In an example each communication media can comprise a CAT 5 or CAT 6 cable and the host server and each wall outlet can implement serial communication e.g. RS 422 therebetween using 1 2 or 4 pairs e.g. twisted pairs of communication lines.

In Example 2 the wall outlet that is used differs from the wall outlet used in Example 1. The wall outlet that is used in Example 2 is shown in . It is to be understood that in practice wall outlet and wall outlet may be used within the same network.

The active module comprises a programmable processor that is coupled to a storage device.
