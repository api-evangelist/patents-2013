The present disclosure is developed under government contract N00024 07 C 5361 awarded by Naval Sea Systems Command. The Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present disclosure relates generally to printed wiring board manufacturing and more particularly to a dummy structure and visual inspection method for printed wiring board etching.

Distributed filters are part of the toolkit for radio frequency RF microwave design and are mostly used at frequencies above the VHF Very High Frequency band 30 to 300 MHz . At these frequencies the physical length of passive components is a significant fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. These distributed filters may be discrete packaged devices soldered to a printed wiring board PWB as a surface mount component. Alternatively to reduce cost filters may be manufactured as part of the PWB so long as line widths and spacing of the components can be tightly controlled to guarantee filter performance. As is known in the art printed wiring boards PWB are relatively difficult to fabricate. PWBs require multiple plating operations in some areas of the structure and include etched circuits with small tolerances consisting of fine lines and or fine gaps in other areas of the PWB. Similarly any PWBs having etched circuits or other structures e.g. hairpin band pass filter structures and multiple plating steps are also relatively difficult to fabricate.

To fabricate such PWBs prior art techniques carefully monitor fabrication and etching processes. Detail prints i.e. fabrication drawings define a final top layer plating thickness and also define an etch accuracy for certain top layer board features. As a result a manufacturer such as a fabrication or assembly house may have to procure and produce additional duplicate PWBs in order to deliver one PWB which passes all inspections tests and meets all of a purchaser s requirements including critical operational requirements. PWBs which do not pass the required inspections tests go unused. This results in wasted PWBs and higher unit cost per PWB. Requiring a PWB vendor to perform 100 measurements will also increase the cost. Moreover even in the event a manufacturer states the PWBs meet a certain etching accuracy it may be late into the build and integration phase of a product incorporating the PWB before such a defect is realized.

In an exemplary embodiment a dummy structure for a printed wiring board PWB includes a unit shape defined on the PWB the unit shape configured to based on a visual inspection thereof provide an indication of one of etching of a PWB circuit element within a desired tolerance range over etching of the PWB circuit element or under etching of the PWB circuit element.

In another embodiment a method of forming a printed wiring board PWB includes forming a circuit element and a dummy structure on a substrate and visually inspecting the dummy structure and based on the appearance of the dummy structure determining one of etching of the circuit element within a desired tolerance range over etching of the circuit element or under etching of the circuit element.

It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration where appropriate reference numerals have been repeated among the different figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. However it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances methods procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the related relevant feature s being described. Also the description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein.

As indicated above microwave distributed components are part of the standard design toolbox. These components include but are not limited to filters couplers splitters and antennas. Key performance characteristics KPC of all of these components include line widths and spacings which must be tightly controlled. Often these components are designed as separate surface mount technology SMT devices procured through an external supplier. This approach however represents an additional cost e.g. procurement additional manufacturing steps testing etc. .

On the other hand components included in a PWB design reduce the procurement and manufacturing costs but may themselves include an increase in cost of the PWB due to additional geometric measurements required for critical parameters. In order to address the issue of requiring tight etching tolerances to achieve specific performance of etched microwave elements a purchaser of such a component may perform 100 measurements upon incoming inspection or alternatively require that the seller provide this data. Either of these approaches however will result in an increase in the cost of the PWB.

Accordingly disclosed herein is a dummy structure designed for use on a PWB characterized by a geometric shape with an angle designed to provide a deterministic etch amplification i.e. an indication of an etch within a desired tolerance or not within desired tolerance whether an over etch or an under etch condition . That is the dummy structure is a PWB artwork feature that determines etching dimensions of metallization elements on the PWB wherein the shape of the dummy structure is specifically configured to provide a reliable visual indication of over under etching.

In a further embodiment the dimensions of a dummy structure unit shape are modified over a range of etch tolerances to provide a visual tool to determine the amount of over under etching. By incorporating such a feature on PWBs that require tight etching tolerances any individual associated with the life cycle of the circuit card assembly may inspect these features to determine etch tolerance without the need for a costly measuring microscope . From the initial build up to and including testing and integration this inspection data may assist in decision making with respect to proceeding or not with a current lot of PWBs. Moreover such over under etching data may help explain voltage standing wave ratio VSWR and other impedance matching issues seen at test and integration.

Referring initially to there is shown a schematic view of a dummy structure for use in printed wiring board etching inspection in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The dummy structure is characterized by a pair of isosceles triangle regions having opposing base sides respectively. Nominally the apex vertices of the triangles meet at a common apex point such that the dummy structure resembles a bow tie shape. An apex angle for the triangle regions may be selected so as to provide a determinable etch amplification as described in further detail below.

Referring now to there is schematic view of the dummy structure of after an over etching process by which the degree of over etching leads to a visible gap in the over etched dummy structure . Here the isosceles triangle regions are over etched such that the sides of triangle regions are reduced including opposing base sides . As a result instead of a single common apex point the apex vertices and of triangle regions are clearly defined in and are separated by a gap g. The dashed region in indicates the nominal shape of the dummy structure of where no over or under etching has occurred. In the example depicted e represents the etching error which is positive for an over etching condition . As e increases the gap g between the triangle regions increases as well. For an apex angle of 29 g 4e. As will be appreciated where e is negative under etching then the apex vertices of the triangle regions would overlap one another as illustrated in further detail below.

A more elaborate version of a dummy structure is illustrated in the schematic diagram of . As is shown the dummy structure includes a plurality of unit shapes though arranged in an array. Typically the available tolerance on line widths and spacings from a PWB vendor without a significant cost increase is about 1 mil 1 1000inch or 25.4 microns m . The arrangement of the dummy structure for an improved visual aid in inspection by providing a size range of unit shapes. Here the original shape from i.e. a pair of isosceles triangle regions having opposing base sides and meeting at a common apex point is represented as unit shape in .

To the immediate left of unit shape is unit shape . In this case the triangle dimensions are reduced by a specific amount e.g. 0.5 mils such that a gap appears between the opposing triangles of unit shape . It will be noted that the distance w between the base sides of the opposing triangles is constant for each unit shape. Again if the apex angle is chosen to be about 29 then the apex gap is about 0.5 mils 4 2.0 mils. It should be appreciated that the dummy structure is not necessarily depicted to scale but is illustrative only. To the immediate left of unit shape is unit shape . In this case the triangle dimensions are further reduced by a specific amount e.g. 1.0 mil with respect to unit shape so as to result in an even larger gap between the opposing triangles of unit shape . Using the example of a 1.0 mil reduction in triangle size and keeping the same base distance w the gap between triangles of unit shape increases to about 4.0 mils.

In contrast to the immediate right of unit shape is unit shape . In this case the triangle dimensions are increased by a specific amount e.g. 0.5 mils such that the apex vertices of the opposing triangles of unit shape begin to overlap one another. This configuration represents an under etch condition where instead of the triangle apex vertices meeting at a common point they begin to merge such that the midpoint of the unit shape has a definitive thickness in the y direction. To complete the dummy structure another unit shape is disposed to the immediate right of unit shape . Here the triangle dimensions are further increased by a specific amount e.g. 1.0 mil with respect to unit shape so as to result in an even larger overlap between the opposing triangles of unit shape . That is the midpoint of unit shape assumes an even larger thickness in the y direction.

On the other hand if the PWB is slightly over etched then the midpoint of unit shape will show a slight gap between the opposing triangles similar to the appearance of a correctly etched unit shape . An over etched unit shape will in turn appear like a correctly etched unit shape etc. Conversely a slightly under etched PWB will result in the unit shape appearing more like a correctly etched unit shape . It will thus be appreciated that a dummy structure having a plurality of unit shapes can provide a sliding scale for a convenient and easy visual determination as to whether a PWB has been etched to a desired tolerance. Presented below are examples of etched PWB band pass filters and associated dummy structures.

Referring now to there is shown an image of a distributed band pass filter and associated dummy structure in which etching was performed to a desired tolerance. In the example depicted the band pass filter has first and second conductive lines separated by a plurality of 2 resonators each coupling over 4 to the neighboring resonator s . For a component such as the band pass filter the input output return loss and ultimately passband ripple is very sensitive to the first resonator gap between resonator and resonator . In this particular design the first resonator gap is ideally 5.0 mils. Measurements determined that the actual first resonator gap of the etched filter was 5.1 mils within an acceptable tolerance.

More significantly the appearance of the dummy structure in reflected the desired etching performance since the midpoint of unit shape appears as if the triangle apex vertices are just touching one another the midpoint of unit shape defines a small gap and the midpoint of unit shape defines a larger gap. In addition the midpoint of unit shape appears as slightly merged with a definitive center thickness in the y direction while the midpoint of unit shape has a noticeably larger center thickness in the y direction. is an enlarged view of the dashed portion of the dummy structure of more particularly illustrating unit shapes and having the expected etch characteristics as described above.

By way of contrast is an image of the same distributed band pass filter and associated dummy structure in which etching is performed beyond a desired tolerance. More specifically the band pass filter was over etched such that the actual first resonator gap measured 5.7 mils beyond the desired tolerance. Furthermore this over etch condition was seen by a visual inspection of the dummy structure . As shown in both and the enlarged view of the midpoint of unit shape is now open instead of having the triangle regions meet at a common apex. That is unit shape of the over etched structure in resembles unit shape of a correctly etched structure e.g. as in . Also unit shape of the over etched structure in resembles unit shape of a correctly etched structure in that the triangle regions meet at a common apex instead of having a thicker connection at the midpoint.

Referring now to there is shown a flow diagram illustrating a method of performing visual inspection for printed wiring board etching in accordance with another exemplary embodiment. In block one or more plating operations for a printed wiring board are performed to form one or more conductive materials on a substrate. Prior to plating a plate resist may be applied to the critical portion s of the PWB in order to protect the critical portion s from plating steps and to maintain the critical portion at a predetermined thickness. The one or more conductive materials may include but are not necessarily limited to conductive metals and conductive non metals. Suitable conductive metals include but are not limited to copper tin silver gold or combinations thereof. Suitable conductive non metals include but are not limited to graphite gallium arsenide and silicon carbide.

In block desired conductor patterns are etched into the PWB. Such structures may include distributed band pass filter or any circuit components formed from conductive materials as well as at least one dummy structure as described above. Following the etching in block a unit shape s of the etched one or more dummy structures is visually inspected. Based on the appearance of the shape the inspection allows for a determination in block that the etch of the circuit components was performed within a desired tolerance the structures were over etched or the structures were under etched.

In addition it is also contemplated that inspection of the shape may also be accomplished in an automated fashion in a circuit card assembly CCA manufacturing environment utilizing flying probe impedance testing. A flying probe is a common test apparatus for newly populated CCAs and measures impedance between combinations of all or some nodes on the circuit card. Beyond the visual inspection method the flying probe test may also measure impedance open short between neighboring diamond patterns in the etched feature see e.g. .

As will thus be appreciated among the technical benefits of the above described embodiments is the ability to provide a simple visual tool to an assembler or tester that a key performance characteristic such as PWB etch tolerance is out of range. Even on structures that may not have critical etched filters certain common components are typically included in the design for an RF CCA such as for example couplers splitters and 50 lines. Each of these components may require certain tolerancing in order to guarantee performance and as such may benefit from having dummy test structures formed on the assembly.

Embodiments of the above described dummy structure may be selectively placed on the PWB for example near the key element s having a tight tolerance or in an unused area. It will further be appreciated that the dummy structure embodiments as described can be made larger or smaller than the above examples and also provide a different range of etching increments e.g. 2 mils 1 mil 0 . Where key dimensions are not measured on a 100 basis this feature may allow a user to visually inspect board etching to within about 0.5 mils.

While the disclosure has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment or embodiments it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the disclosure without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore it is intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this disclosure but that the disclosure will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.
