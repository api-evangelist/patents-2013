This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT GB2012 050334 filed Feb. 14 2012 and designating the U.S. which claims priority to Great Britain Patent Application No. GB 1104620.8 filed Mar. 18 2011 which also claims priority to the U.S. Patent Application No. 61 442 775 filed Feb. 14 2011 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present disclosure relates to the communication of data. In particular but not exclusively the present disclosure relates to the communication of data between user devices during telephone calls.

Communication between parties in a telecommunications network can be carried out in a number of ways. Most commonly communication is carried out by a calling party dialing the telephone dialing number of a called party telephony device on a calling party telephony device. The dialing of the telephone number causes a call set up process to be carried out in the network which results in the telephone of the called party ringing. If the called party chooses to answer their telephone a telephone call can ensue between the calling party and the called party. The telephone call allows audio data such as speech data to be transferred along an audio channel created between the calling party telephony device and the called party telephony device.

Some telephony devices have enhanced capabilities which allow transfer of video data along a video channel created between the calling party telephone and the called party telephone. A video call may not be possible unless both the calling and called party telephone devices support video call functionality.

Audio or video conferencing may be carried out between three or more remote telephony devices allowing communication of audio and or video data between parties to the conference.

Web conferencing is also possible between multiple remote parties using devices with combined data processing display and telephony capabilities. Web conferencing allows online meetings to be conducted for viewing and or collaborating on common multimedia content.

Parties may also exchange text data by use of text messaging services such as the Short Message Service SMS . Enhanced messaging services such as the Multimedia Messaging Service MMS allow parties to exchange image and video data in addition to text data.

The example methods of communication described above provide a wide range of ways for remote parties to communicate with each other. However each method typically has different requirements in terms of device and or network capability and interchanging between the different methods is either not possible or requires use of inconvenient set up or configuration processes.

It would therefore be desirable to provide improved methods for communicating data between remote parties including communication of data in a manner convenient to the parties.

In accordance with fifth embodiments there is a computer program product comprising a non transitory computer readable storage medium having computer readable instructions stored thereon the computer readable instructions being executable by a computerized device to cause the computerized device to operate a telephony device and or apparatus according to the first second third or fourth embodiments.

Further features of embodiments will become apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments given by way of example only which is made with reference to the accompanying drawings.

PLMN A and PLMN B contain mobile telephony network infrastructure including one or more mobile switching centers one or more base station controllers and one or more base transceiver stations the function of such entities is well known in the art and will not be described in detail here.

PLMN A and PLMN B are connected via a telecommunications network comprising one or more Public Switched Telephone Networks PSTNs and or packet networks. Telecommunications network comprises one or more media and or signaling gateway entities not shown for performing conversion between the various protocols and data formats used to transfer media and signaling data within and between the different networks. Server or server system has an associated data store and is connected to telecommunications network via a packet network . Although server is depicted as a single entity in server may be a single device a cluster of servers or servers forming a server system which is distributed throughout the data communications network.

MS A has an associated identity in the form of a telephone dialing number TDN TDN A. MS B has an associated identity in the form of a telephone dialing number TDN B. MS A has communication session application software running on it with an associated application identifier AppID A. MS B also has communication session application software running on it with an associated application identifier AppID B.

In some embodiments during installation of the application software on MS A server may be informed of AppID A and creates a record for MS A in data store containing AppID A stored in association with TDN A. Similarly in some embodiments during installation of the application software on MS B server may informed of AppID B and creates a record for MS B in data store containing AppID B stored in association with TDN B.

In this and subsequent flow diagrams solid arrows denote transfer of control messaging or signaling data whereas dashed arrows denote transfer of media or payload data.

A voice call is currently in progress between MS A in PLMN A and MS B in PLMN B as shown by item . The voice call will typically be a circuit switched voice call the set up and control for which is known in the art.

Application software running on MS A detects that there is a call in progress between MS A and MS B and notifies server of call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with MS A and TDN B associated with MS B in step . Similarly application software running on MS B detects the call in progress between MS B and MS A and notifies server of call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with MS A and TDN B associated with MS B in step

Application software running on MS A may detect that the call is in progress by registering with the operating system of MS A to be notified upon start of a call involving MS A. This could for example involve registering with an application programming interface API of the operating system of MS A associated with start and end of call events. A similar call detection process may occur on MS B.

In these embodiments the user of MS A could be the calling or the called party for the call. Call party details are received from both telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the calling party and telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the called party for the call e.g. telephony device MS A and telephony device MS B.

Server identifies that the notification of step from MS A and notification of step from MS B have call party details TDN A and TDN B in common and establishes a separate communications session separate from the telephone call for the communication of data between MS A and MS B. The separate communications session is established on the basis of the received call party details TDN A and TDN B. The separate communications session is established whilst the telephone call is in progress and is continued in parallel with the telephone call such that voice call data is transmitted via the telephone call and other data may be transmitted via the communications session after the establishment of the separate communications session.

Server updates the records for MS A and MS B in data store to indicate that a call is in progress between MS A and MS B and that a communications session between MS A and MS B separate to the voice call between MS A and MS B has been established in step

Server may respond not shown to the notifications of steps and by responding with respective acknowledgements to MS A and MS B.

If MS A wants to communicate data to e.g. share data with MS B it transmits the data to server in step . Server performs a lookup in data store using TDN A for MS A in step and identifies that a communications session has been established between MS A and MS B. Server retrieves TDN B for MS B in step and transmits the data received from MS A to MS B using the retrieved TDN B in step

In embodiments the lookup in data store of step may also result in AppID B being retrieved. The data may then be transmitted to MS B using both TDN B and AppID B with TDN B being used to locate MS B and AppID B being used to direct the data to the communications session application software running on MS B. The data may be transmitted by means of a push notification directed to AppID B of the communication session application on MS B. In the case of MS B being an Apple iPhone the push notification could employ use of the Apple Push Notification Service APNS .

If MS B wants to send data to MS A it sends the data to server in step . Server performs a lookup in data store using TDN B for MS B in step and identifies that a communications session has been established between MS B and MS A. Server retrieves TDN A for MS A in step and transmits the data received from MS B to MS A using the retrieved TDN A in step

In embodiments the lookup in data store of step may also result in AppID A being retrieved. The data may then be transmitted to MS A using both TDN A and AppID A with TDN A being used to locate MS A and AppID A being used to direct the data to the communications session application software running on MS A. The data may be transmitted by means of a push notification directed to AppID A of the communication session application on MS A.

In embodiments the communication session is established in the form of a client server relationship with server acting as the server and each of MS A and MS B acting as clients. One connection is created between server and MS A and another connection is created between server and MS B. The two connections together create a channel between MS A and MS B through which data can be communicated in either direction.

In embodiments server establishes client server connections with MS A and MS B in response to receiving one or more client server connection requests.

In embodiments a client server connection request is transmitted in response to the telephone call being established between MS A and MS B. In other embodiments a client server connection request is transmitted in response to initiation of a data communications service on MS A or MS B after the telephone call is established between them.

Each of the connections could be HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP or HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS connections.

To avoid loss of the channel between MS and MS B the connections can be maintained by maintenance messages heartbeats transmitted from server to MS A and MS B for example transmitted at periodic intervals sufficiently short to prevent time out of the connections due to inactivity e.g. a client server connection can be maintained by transmitting a message to keep the connection alive if the telephone call lasts more than a connection threshold period.

The data communicated via the session may comprise server receiving data identifying a downloadable resource selected from the group consisting of a photographic image data file a word processing document data file a spreadsheet document data file a presentation document data file a video image data file and streaming video from one of MS A and MS B during the separate communications session and transmitting the data to the other of MS A and MS B for example via the client server connection.

In embodiments the communications session between MS A and MS B can be maintained after the voice call is terminated allowing the users of MS A and MS B to continue communicating data between their user devices.

In alternative embodiments the separate communications session is established via server and data is transmitted via a data communication path between MS A and MS B which is established on the basis of information received from said server but with server not being including in the data communication path.

Server may receive a service data object from MS A or MS B during the separate communications session and transmit the service data object to the other of MS A and MS B.

Server may receive a service data object from MS A or MS B during the separate communications session process the service data object in combination with additional service data to generate derived service data and transmit the derived service data to the other of MS A and MS B.

Application software running on MS A detects that there is a call in progress between MS A and MS B and notifies server of call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with MS A and TDN B associated with MS B in step . Here however MS B does not have application software or any other capability which can detect the call with MS A and notify server of such. Instead server notifies MS B of the receipt of call party details for the call from MS A by transmitting a separate communication session initiation request to MS B in step . The communication session initiation request may cause a message such as Do you want to establish a data communication session with the party you are speaking to or such like. If the user of MS B accepts the request by appropriate user input MS B transmits a separate communication session initiation response to server in step indicating that a communication session between MS B and MS A separate to the voice call should be established.

In these embodiments the user of MS A could be the calling or the called party for the call. Call party details are received from either telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the calling party or telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the called party e.g. MS A.

Once the response of step is received server updates the records for MS A and MS B in data store in step to indicate that a call is in progress between MS A and MS B and that a separate communications session between MS A and MS B should be established.

Similarly to described above server establishes a separate communications session separate from the telephone call for the communication of data between MS A and MS B. The separate communications session is established on the basis of the received call party details e.g. TDN A and TDN B whilst the telephone call is in progress and is continued in parallel with the telephone call such that voice call data is transmitted via the telephone call and other data can be transmitted via the communications session after the establishment of the separate communications session.

Communication of data from MS A to MS B can now occur in steps to by a similar process to that described above for steps to in relation to . Further communication of data from MS B to MS A can now occur in steps to in a similar process to that described above for steps to in relation to .

The embodiments of however involve an analogue telephone sometimes referred to as a Plain Old Telephone Service POTS telephone or a black phone denoted POTS A located in PSTN A and a mobile station MS B located in PLMN B. PSTN A and PLMN B are connected via a telecommunications network comprising one or more PSTNs and or packet networks. Further the user of POTS A also has an associated personal computer PC A connected to packet network .

In these embodiments the user of POTS A cannot conduct communications sessions separate to voice calls conducted via POTS A just using POTS A alone. The user of POTS A therefore additionally employs PC A through which separate communications sessions can be conducted. To provide both voice calls via POTS A and separate communication sessions via PC A POTS phone and PC A are coupled together logically.

POTS A has an associated telephone dialing number TDN A and MS B has an associated telephone dialing number TDN B. PC A has an associated network address in the form of an Internet Protocol IP address IP A in packet network . MS B has communications session application software running on it with an associated identifier AppID B.

PSTN A includes a network element in the form of a call switching element sometimes referred to as a Service Switching Point SSP which is capable of detecting whether a query should be raised in relation to calls to from particular telephone dialing numbers by analyzing in call signaling information for the calls. Network element acts on behalf of the user of POTS A and PC A and is configured to trigger a query e.g. hand call control to a service control point SCP network node when it detects a predetermined call state for a call to from TDN A associated with POTS A for example by use of an Intelligent Network IN or Advanced Intelligent Network AIN call origination termination trigger. SCP is a network node responsible for deciding upon how such queries should be dealt with and acting accordingly for example responding to network element with appropriate instructions. The query from network element to SCP may pass via one or more Signaling Transfer Points STPs not shown .

Upon receipt of in call signaling information relating to a query from network element SCP is configured to trigger notification of such to server . Any such notification to server will include call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with POTS A and TDN B associated with MS B.

Configuration of SCP may involve storing an IP address for server in association with TDN A such that when in call signaling information relating to a call to from POTS A is received notification to server at the stored IP address is triggered.

In the embodiments of POTS A has no communication session application software running on it. Further POTS A has no capability to generate notifications when a call is outgoing from or incoming to POTS A.

Instead PC A has communication session application software running on it for facilitating communication sessions according to embodiments.

During installation of the communication session application software on PC A server is informed that PC A and POTS A are to be coupled together logically. PC A sends IP A and TDN A to server which creates a record for the user of POTS A and PC A in data store containing IP A stored in association with TDN A. Similarly during installation of the application software on MS B server is informed of AppID B and creates a record for MS B in data store containing AppID B stored in association with TDN B.

In the case of an outgoing call being made by POTS A to MS B network element receives in call signaling information for the call including TDN A for which an AIN call origination trigger is configured. This triggers notification of call party details for the call to server in step

In the case of an incoming call being received by POTS A from MS B network element receives in call signaling information for the call including TDN for which an AIN call termination trigger is configured. This triggers notification of call party details for the call to server in step

A call termination origination trigger relating to a call to from POTS A will include call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with POTS A and TDN B associated with MS B.

Application software running on MS B detects the call in progress between MS B and POTS A and notifies server of call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with POTS A and TDN B associated with MS B in step

In these embodiments the user of POTS A could be the calling or the called party for the call. Call party details are received from telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the calling party and telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the called party e.g. network element and MS B.

Server identifies that the notification of step from network element and the notification of step from MS B have call party details TDN A and TDN B in common e.g. server matches the call party details received on behalf of each respective party to the call.

Server maps the identity TDN A of POTS A to the network address for PC A e.g. IP A by reference to data store . Alternatively IP A may be received during the call along with the call party details.

Server establishes a communications session separate from the telephone call between POTS A and MS B for the communication of data between PC A and MS B. The separate communications session is established on the basis of the received call party details e.g. TDN A and TDN B. Once the separate communications session is established voice call data is transmitted via the telephone call and other data can be transmitted via the separate communications session.

Server notifies PC A via IP A that a call has been detected between POTS A and MS B and that a separate communications session has been established between PC A and MS B in step

Server updates the records for POTS A PC A and MS B in data store in step to indicate that a call is in progress between POTS A and MS B and that a separate communications session between PC A and MS B has been established.

If the user of POTS A and PC A wants to communicate data to MS B the user sends the data using PC A to server in step . Server performs a lookup in data store using IP A for PC A in step and identifies that a communications session has been established between PC A and MS B separately to the call taking place between POTS A and MS B. Server retrieves TDN B for MS B in step and transmits the data received from PC A to MS B using the retrieved TDN B in step

In embodiments the lookup in data store of step may also result in AppID B being retrieved. The data may then be transmitted to MS B using both TDN B and AppID B with TDN B being used to locate MS B and AppID B being used to direct the data to the communications session application software running on MS B.

If the user of MS B wants to send data to the user of POTS A and PC A the user of MS B sends the data to server in step . Server performs a lookup in data store using TDN A for POTS A in step and identifies that a communications session has been established between PC A and MS B separately to the call taking place between MS B and POTS A. Server retrieves IP A for PC A in step and transmits the data received from MS B to PC A using the retrieved IP A in step

In alternative embodiments instead of both call party detail notifications being sent to server in steps and server may instead notify MS B of the request from PC A to initiate establishment of a separate communications session in a similar manner to step described above in relation to . Similarly to step MS B will then transmit a communication session initiation response in response to user input on MS B indicating acceptance of the request to server indicating that a communication session separate to the voice call between POTS A and MS B should be established between MS B and PC A.

Similarly to embodiments described above in relation to the communication session is established in the form of a client server relationship with server acting as the server and each of PC A and MS B acting as clients. One connection is created between server and PC A and another connection is created between server and MS B. The two connections together create a channel between PC A and MS B through which data can be communicated in either direction.

In some embodiments establishing the session comprises receiving a client server connection request from PC A and establishing a client server connection with PC A. In other embodiments establishing the session comprises receiving a client server connection request from MS B and establishing a client server connection with MS B.

In embodiments the client server connection request is transmitted in response to the telephone call between POTS A and MS B being established. In other embodiments the client server connection request is transmitted in response to initiation of a data communications service on PC A after the telephone call between POTS A and MS B is established.

If the call between POTS A and MS B is terminated at any stage and server receives an indication of such a notification message may be transmitted to PC A to inform it of a change of state of the separate communication session.

In alternative embodiments network element is a call initiating element for example configured to initiate the establishment of the telephone call between POTS A and MS B in response to a remote click to dial website action by a user.

Configuration of SCP may involve storing an IP address IP A for PC A in association with TDN A such that when a call is received to from POTS A PC A can be notified at the stored IP address.

In the embodiments of when network element detects the call being conducted between POTS A and MS B it transmits call party details for the call TDN A and TDN B to PC A in step . PC A forwards the call party details notification including TDN A and TDN B to server in step

Application software running on MS B detects the call in progress between MS B and POTS A and notifies server of call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with POTS A and TDN B associated with MS B in step

In these embodiments the user of POTS A could be the calling or the called party for the call. Call party details are received from telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the calling party and telephony apparatus acting on behalf of the called party e.g. PC A and MS B.

In the embodiments of MS A has communication session application software running on it with an associated identifier AppID A. However MS A does not have application software or any other capability for detecting calls to from MS A and notifying server of such.

MS B has communication session application software running on it with an associated identifier AppID B. In addition MS B has application software running on it which is capable of detecting calls to from MS B and notifying server of such.

The further information could include an IP address domain name or URL for locating content server in packet network such further information may be stored locally to server or could be obtained via a search or query process carried out by server within packet network or beyond. In such a case server will additionally provide such further information to MS B in step

In alternative embodiments when server receives the software component identifier in step it performs a lookup in data store and identifies that that a separate communications session has been established between PC A and MS B. Server then downloads the software component from content server itself using the software component identifier received from PC A and transmits the software component directly to MS B.

In further alternative embodiments instead of PC A transmitting an identifier for the software component to server as per step PC A transmits the software component itself to server . Server performs a lookup in data store and identifies that that a separate communications session has been established between PC A and MS B and transmits the software component received from PC A to MS B.

In embodiments before download of the software component to MS B or PC A is enabled a capability check is conducted to determine whether MS B or PC A is initially enabled with the software component. If the capability check indicates that the respective user device is not initially enabled with the software component then enabling of the download may proceed.

In some embodiments capability data for one or more user devices is stored in data store and server may carry out a capability check by reference to data store . In other embodiments the capability check involves transmitting a capability query to a user device and receiving a response indicating whether said the device is initially enabled with the software component.

In embodiments the separate communications session is established using a session establishment software application or operating system function on the user device to which the software component is being downloaded to and the software component is a software application which interoperates with the session establishment software application or operating system function.

In embodiments a client server connection request is transmitted by the user device to which the software component is being downloaded to server and a client server connection is established between server and that device. The software component is transmitted via the established client server connection. The client server connection request could be transmitted in response to the telephone call being established or in response to a notification received during the telephone call after the telephone call is established.

Steps to of depict detection of a voice call between POTS A and MS B by network element and notification of call party details for such to server detection of the call between POTS A and MS B by MS B and notification of call party details for such to server as well as notification of the detected call to PC A.

When server receives the call party details for the call between POTS A and MS B in steps and it performs a lookup in data store for the TDNs of MS A and MS B in step . From the lookup information received in step server identifies that MS B is an initially non enabled user device that does not currently have a capability associated with participating in a communication session separate to the voice call between POTS A and MS B.

For example a data record for MS B in data store may indicate that MS B does not have communications session software installed on it or there may be no data record at all for MS B in data store which also indicates that MS B does not have communications session software installed on it.

In these embodiments in order to provide the initially non enabled user device MS B with the capability associated with participating in the session server enables the download of a software application to the initially non enabled user device MS B.

Server enables the download of the software application by transmitting an identifier for the software application to MS B in step . The identifier could be transmitted to MS B embedded in a text message such as an SMS message.

Using the received software application identifier MS B sends a download request for the software application to content server in step . Content server then provides the software application to MS B in step

MS B proceeds to install the software application which when installed sends an installation confirmation message to server in step . Server is now able to establish a communications session between PC A and MS B which is separate to the voice call being conducted between POTS A and MS B.

Once the separate communications session between MS B and PC A is established MS B may communicate data to PC A as shown in steps to in a similar manner to steps to as described above in relation to . Further communication of data from MS B to MS A can now occur not shown in a similar process to that described above for steps to in relation to .

In embodiments establishment of the separate communications session may be initiated by the user of POTS A and PC A for example by user input on PC A. The user input causes communications session software installed on PC A to transmit a communications session initiation request message to server which then proceeds to establish a separate communications session as described above.

Similarly to steps to described above in relation to steps to of depict detection of a voice call between POTS A and MS B by network element and notification of call party details for such to server detection of the call between POTS A and MS B by MS B and notification of such to server establishment of a separate communications session between PC A and MS B and notification of such to PC A and updating of data store accordingly.

In these embodiments the user of POTS A and PC A transmits from PC A an identifier identifying a feature of the communications session separate to the voice call between POTS A and MS B that requires authorization for use by MS B in step . The feature could for example be a software component or media data and the identifier could be a URL or other network address at which the feature can be located.

Upon receipt of the feature identifier server transmits an authorization requirement query containing the feature identifier to authorization server in step . The authorization requirement query has the effect of asking the authorization server whether authorization for use of the identified feature by MS B in the separate communications session is required. Authorization server performs any appropriate checks for example with reference to a copyright records database not shown and transmits an authorization requirement response back to server in step . In this case the authorization requirement response of step indicates that authorization for use of the identified feature by MS B is required for example A copyright fee of xx must be paid for use of the identified feature in the separate communications session.

Server now requests authorization from the user of PC A and POTS A to authorize the use of the identified feature by MS B in the separate communications session in step for example asking the user of POTS A and PC A whether they are willing to accept the xx copyright charge. The user of POTS A and PC A accepts the charge by appropriate input via PC A which results in an indication of authorization being transmitted from PC A to server in step

When server receives the authorization indication of step from PC A server enables the use of the feature by MS B in the separate communications session. Server contacts authorization server in step requesting that authorization for the identified feature be granted. Server responds to server with an authorization grant in step

Granting authorization may involve authorization server contacting a payment server of an appropriate financial institution on behalf of the user device in question for example to pay a copyright fee for use of the feature. The charge will generally be passed on to a an account associated with the user of POTS A and PC A because it is that user who is requesting use of the identified feature by the user of MS B in the separate communications session.

The user of PC A is informed that authorization of the feature has been granted by a message transmitted from server to PC A in step for example including confirmation of the amount charged to their account.

Server enables use of the feature for MS B by transmitting an identifier for the feature along with an authorization token proving that use of the feature by MS B has been authorized. The user of MS B can then download not shown or otherwise access the feature using the feature identifier and authorization token received from server without having to request authorization or pay for such . Download of the feature may involve contacting a content server such as item in .

The authorization token may include a purchase token proving that a copyright fee or suchlike has already been paid for use of the feature.

In some embodiments the feature may involve using a service application which requires authorization in order to process service data transmitted during the separate communications session. In alternative embodiments the feature may involve accessing data which requires authorization in relation to which an identifier is transmitted during the separate communications session.

Network element receives in call signaling information for the call between MS A and MS B which triggers notification of call party details including TDN A and TDN B for the call to server in step

Application software running on MS B detects the call in progress between MS B and MS A and notifies server of call party details for the call e.g. the TDNs of telephones involved in the call TDN A associated with MS A and TDN B associated with MS B in step

Server identifies that the notification of step from network element and the notification of step from MS B have call party details TDN A and TDN B in common and establishes a communications session separate from the telephone call between MS A and MS B for the communication of data between MS A and MS B. The separate communications session is established whilst the telephone call is in progress on the basis of the received call party details e.g. TDN A and TDN B. Once the separate communications session is established voice call data is transmitted via the telephone call and other data can be transmitted via the separate communications session.

Server notifies MS A that a call has been detected between MS A and MS B and that a separate communications session has been established between MS A and MS B in step

Server updates the records for MS A and MS B in data store in step to indicate that a call is in progress between MS A and MS B and that a separate communications session between MS A and MS B has been established.

In these embodiments the user of MS A wishes to obtain geographical location data for MS B for example to use in relation to a map creation application running on MS A. MS A transmits a geographical location capability check message to server in step the capability check message is for checking the capability of MS B to provide geographical location data relating to its physical location for example checking if MS B has a map creation application running on it.

Server forwards the geographical location capability check message on to MS B in step . Mobile station MS B responds by sending a geographical location capability response message to server in step which forwards this on to MS A in step the capability response message includes information as to whether MS B can provide geographical location data relating to its physical location.

In this embodiment the capability response message informs MS A that MS B is able to provide geographical location data by use of its geographical location module so MS A transmits a request for geographical location data for MS B to server in step . Server forwards the request from MS A to MS B in step

When MS B receives the request for geographical location data from server in step MS B instructs its geographical location module to carry out a geographical location process and provide geographical location data relating to the physical location of MS B in step . The geographical location data resulting from step is transmitted to server in step . Server then transmits data including or derived from the geographical location data received in step to MS A in step

The map creation application of MS A can use the geographical location data received from server in step to create a map which incorporates a representation of the physical location of MS B. For example the received geographical location data may include a grid reference or longitude and latitude parameters which can be processed by the map creation application to plot the location of MS B within a map stored or accessible by MS A. Such embodiments could for example be useful for the user of MS A to give directions to MS B verbally during the telephone call being conducted via MS A and MS B with reference to the created map and indication of the location of MS B thereon.

In embodiments steps to are repeated allowing display of a dynamically updating map on MS A that shows changes in the physical location of MS B as they happen. Alternatively steps to can be repeated allowing updating of the map on MS A without further requests as per steps and being required.

In embodiments where MS B is not able to provide geographical location data for example because MS B has no geographical location module or other such capability the capability response message of step will state so thus informing MS A that communication of geographical location data from MS B is not possible. In alternative embodiments where MS B is not able to provide geographical location data MS B may not send any capability response message and after a predetermined period with no response being received MS A might conclude that communication of geographical location data from MS B will not be possible.

In further alternative embodiments the geographical location capability check message of step can be combined with the request for geographical location data of step and the geographical location capability response message of step can be combined with the transmittal of geographical location data of step

Embodiments involve MS A checking the capability of MS B to process and or display geographical location data by transmitting a geographical location capability check message to server in step . Server forwards the geographical location capability check message on to MS B in step . Mobile station MS B responds by sending a geographical location capability response message to server in step which forwards this on to MS A in step

In this embodiment the capability response message informs MS A that MS B is able to process geographical location data by use of its map creation application so the user of MS A triggers generation of appropriate geographical location data by appropriate input to the mapping application of MS A. Alternatively generation of geographical location data could occur upon receipt of the capability response message of step without any input from the user of MS A being required.

MS A instructs its geographical location module to carry out a geographical location process and provide geographical location data relating to the physical location of MS A in step . The geographical location data resulting from step is transmitted to server in step . Server then transmits data including or derived from the geographical location data received in step to MS B in step

The map creation application of MS B can use the geographical location data received from server in step to create a map which incorporates a representation of the physical location of MS A. Such embodiments could for example be useful for the user of MS B to give directions to the user of MS A verbally during the telephone call being conducted via MS A and MS B with reference to the created map and indication of the location of MS A thereon.

In embodiments steps to can be repeated allowing display of a dynamically updating map on MS B that depicts changes in the physical location of MS A as they occur.

In alternative embodiments MS B has no map creation application for creating maps for display on MS B but does have the capability to display images such information being indicated in the location capability response message of step . In such embodiments the MS A itself plots a map containing a physical representation of its physical location and creates an map image for example a screenshot from the map creation application depicting this information for transmittal to MS B via server in steps and these steps would therefore involve transmittal of media image data. Upon receipt of the image data MS B is able to display the image of the map created and provided by MS A thus allowing the user of MS B to view a representation of the physical location of MS A even though MS B has no map creation capability itself.

In further alternative embodiments where MS B has no map creation application for creating maps for display on MS B but does have the capability to display images a network link such as a URL for an online mapping service such as Google Maps is transmitted to MS B. The network link contains information relating to the physical location of MS A and can be created by MS A and transmitted to server for transmittal on to MS B or can be derived from the geographical location data received from MS A by server and transmitted on to MS B. When MS B receives the network link it accesses the mapping service using the received network link. The mapping service uses the information in the network link relating to the physical location of MS A to generate a map image including a representation of the physical location of MS A and transmits the map image to MS B. Once MS B has downloaded the map image it displays the map image to the user of MS B thus allowing the user of MS B to view a representation of the physical location of MS A even though MS B has no map creation capability itself.

In embodiments the geographical location data is received by server in the form of a data object including geographical coordinate data. A capability check can then be carried out by server in relation to whether the respective user device is capable of processing the geographical coordinate data during the separate communications session. If the capability check indicates that the respective user device is capable of processing the geographical coordinate data server will transmit the geographical coordinate data during the separate communications session.

Establishing the separate communication session may comprise receiving a client server connection request from and establishing a client server connection with the appropriate user device and transmitting the data including or derived from the received geographical location data via the client server connection.

Embodiments described below in relation to involve establishing a communications session for communication of data between at least two devices in a data communications network. In these embodiments one of the at least two devices comprises a telephony user device comprising a reconfigurable graphical user interface. Another of the at least two devices comprises a device associated with a service provider. The service provider also has one or more associated telephony devices.

ACD is capable of distributing incoming telephone calls to one or more user agents at which respective user agent operators are available. Incoming calls to the service provider system are distributed according to the availability of user agent operators at their associated user agent positions. When an incoming call from a customer is distributed to an available user agent position a user agent operator associated with that user agent position can speak to the customer via their associated user agent telephony device and can process service data related to a service being provided to the customer via their associated computing device.

Data communications part comprises a computing device such as a server with Computer Telephony Integration CTI capabilities. Data communications part uses CTI techniques to provide user agent operators with information displayed via their associated user agent computing devices relating to calls they are conducting with customers. Data communications part is capable of establishing and or processing communication sessions between user agent computing devices and devices external to service provider system . Incoming data which data communications part receives from an external device via a communication session can be passed on to the appropriate user agent computing device and vice versa for outgoing data from a user agent computing device.

Telephony user device MS A is capable of establishing a communications session for communication of data with respect to at least one other device in a data communications network. MS A includes a reconfigurable graphical user interface.

The user of MS A dials the telephone dialing number associated with service provider system which results in automatic call distributing system receiving the incoming call. ACD proceeds to identify an available user agent operator to take the incoming call. In these embodiments the user of MS A is a customer of the service provider.

ACD identifies that a user agent operator is available at a user agent position for example agent position UA 1 depicted in having an associated telephone depicted UA Telephone in and computing device and distributes the call to that UA Telephone accordingly. A voice call is thus established between MS A and UA Telephone as shown by item .

Application software running on MS A detects that there is a call in progress between MS A and UA Telephone and notifies server of call party details for the call in step . The call party details of step may comprise a TDN associated with MS A and a TDN associated with service provider system .

ACD notifies data communications part that a call is in progress between UA Telephone and MS A. Data communications part notifies server of call party details for the call in step . The call party details of step may comprise a TDN associated with MS A and a TDN associated with service provider system . The call party details of step may also comprise an extension number associated with UA Telephone.

Server establishes a separate communications session separate from the telephone call between MS A and UA Telephone for the transfer of data between MS A and data communications part as shown by item . The session is established on the basis of the one or more call party details associated with the telephone call. Data communications part forwards data received via the separate communication session to the computing device associated with the user agent operator of UA telephone and vice versa as and when necessary.

Upon establishment of the separate communications session server sends a request for configuration data determined by the service provider to data store in step resulting in configuration data determined by the service provider being retrieved in step . Server transmits the retrieved configuration data to MS A via the separate communication session in step

When MS A receives the configuration data of step it reconfigures at least a first part of its graphical user interface according to the received configuration data as shown by step

MS A confirms to server that it has reconfigured at least a first part of its graphical user interface according to the received configuration data in step and server in turn notifies data communications part of such in step . Data communications part notifies the appropriate user agent computing device of the reconfiguration such that the user agent operator conducting the telephone call with the user of MS A knows that the graphical user interface of MS A has been reconfigured according to the configuration data. The user agent operator can thus conduct the call accordingly for example referring to information displayed via the reconfigured graphical user interface during the call.

In the above embodiments the configuration data has been predetermined by the service provider prior to the call and provided to server for storage in data store . Server is thus able to retrieve the predetermined configuration data from data store upon establishment of the separate communications session without having to contact service provider system .

In these embodiments the configuration data has been predetermined by the service provider prior to the call but has not been provided to server . Instead the predetermined configuration is stored in service provider data store .

Similarly to the embodiments of a call is currently in progress between MS A and UA Telephone as shown by item MS A notifies server of the call in progress in step data communications part notifies server of the call in progress in step and a separate communication session is established between MS A and data communications part as shown by item .

In these embodiments upon establishment of the separate communications session server sends a request for configuration data determined by the service provider for transmittal to MS A to data communications part in step . Data communications part forwards the configuration data request to service provider data store in step . This results in configuration data determined by the service provider being retrieved by data communications part in step which forwards the retrieved configuration data to server in step

Server transmits the retrieved configuration data to MS A via the separate communication session in step . When MS A receives the configuration data of step it reconfigures at least a first part of its graphical user interface according to the received configuration data as shown by step . MS A confirms to server that it has reconfigured the at least first part of its graphical user interface according to the received configuration data in step and server in turn notifies data communications part of such in step

Item of indicates one or more steps involving interaction between MS A server and or service provider computing device during the call between the user of MS A and the user agent operator associated with UA Telephone. Some examples of such interaction are described later below.

During the call the user agent operator associated with service provider computing device realizes that further reconfiguration of the graphical user interface of MS A during the call i.e. dynamic reconfiguration is desirable and proceeds to initiate dynamic reconfiguration accordingly. This involves the user agent operator providing user input to their agent position computing device for example selecting an appropriate action from an on screen menu on a display part of the agent position computing device.

The user input is passed to data communications part which sends a request for appropriate dynamic configuration data to service provider data store accordingly in step . The configuration data is dynamic because it is related to a reconfiguration process occurring during the call.

Dynamic configuration data is retrieved by data communications part in step which transmits the retrieved dynamic configuration data on to server via the separate communication session in step

Server transmits the dynamic configuration data received in step to MS A via the separate communication session in step . When MS A receives the dynamic configuration data of step it reconfigures at least a second part of its graphical user interface according to the received dynamic configuration data as shown by step . MS A confirms to server that it has reconfigured the at least second part of its graphical user interface according to the received configuration data in step and server in turn notifies data communications part of such in step

The user agent operator conducting the telephone call with the user of MS A now knows that the graphical user interface of MS A has been reconfigured according to the dynamic configuration data. The user agent operator can thus conduct the call accordingly for example referring to information displayed via the dynamically reconfigured graphical user interface during the call.

MS A comprises a body hard wired input keys and a power on off button . MS A comprises a touch screen user interface which is operable to output a graphics display and receive input via user touches on the interface. Hard wired input keys may be operable to execute common operations such as Open menu Go to home screen Go back to last screen etc. Alternatively one or more hard wired input keys may be implemented as soft keys on touch screen .

MS A supports a variety of different communication methods including telephony functionality enabling a user to conduct incoming and outgoing telephone calls with one or more remote users in a telecommunications network not shown . MS A comprises a number of components not shown which are known in the art the operation of which is not described here in detail including one or more radio frequency transceiver s and aerial s a speech coder decoder connected to a loudspeaker and a microphone and in some embodiments a removable Subscriber Identity Module SIM connected via electrical contacts.

MS A includes data transfer capabilities including data packet input output via a data input output interface with one or more Internet Protocol IP parts of the telecommunications network. MS A may include messaging functionality for example Short Message Service SMS and Multimedia Messaging Service MMS messaging.

In these embodiments the user of MS A is currently conducting a call with a user agent operator of service provider system as described above in relation to . An in call screen application is thus configured to display an in call screen on touch screen user interface . The in call screen displayed on touch screen user interface includes a number of soft keys which are responsive to user touches to provide input to the in call screen application running on mobile telephony MS A. The soft keys include dial pad digits 1 2 . . . to 0 and the star and hash symbols which are used for entering telephone dialing numbers. The soft keys also include several other soft keys which are operable to initiate other in call functionality in response to user input for example end call call hold mute speaker phone and show hide dial pad operations.

In these embodiments configuration data determined by the service provider prior to the call has been received by MS A via the separate communication session as per steps to of or steps to of . MS A reconfigures at least a first part of its touch screen user interface according to the received predetermined configuration data as depicted by step of or step of .

In these embodiments the reconfiguration results in an overlay portion being displayed over the at least first part of the screen as shown by item in . In these embodiments overlay portion comprises a translucent layer such that the portion of the screen below overlay portion is visible through overlay portion . In this case the soft keys for digits 5 and 6 on the dial pad part of the in call screen can be seen through translucent overlay portion .

In these embodiments overlay portion comprises several touch sensitive screen regions which are operable to initiate one or more operations of MS A independently of the in call screen application in response to user input via touch sensitive screen regions . This means that user input via any of touch sensitive screen regions will be passed to other application software of MS A rather than to the in call screen application displaying the in call screen below the overlay portion e.g. pressing touch sensitive screen region will not provide a user input of the dial pad digits 5 or 6 to the in call screen application but rather will be passed to other application software of MS A for processing.

Embodiments therefore allow other tasks to be initiated on MS A which do not involve sending data associated with user input such as in band Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF tones via the telephone call being conducted between MS A and the UA Telephone.

Embodiments therefore allow other tasks to be initiated on MS A which do not involve sending data associated with user input via the communication session established between MS A and data communications part .

In these embodiments dynamic configuration data has been received by MS A via the separate communication session as per steps to of . MS A reconfigures at least a second part of its touch screen user interface according to the received dynamic configuration data as depicted by step of or step of .

In these embodiments the reconfiguration results in a further overlay portion being displayed over the at least second part of the screen as shown by item in . In these embodiments overlay portion comprises a translucent layer such that the portion of the screen below overlay portion is visible through overlay portion . In this case the soft keys for digits 8 and 9 on the dial pad part of the in call screen can be seen through translucent overlay portion .

In these embodiments overlay portion comprises a further touch sensitive screen region which is operable to initiate one or more operations of MS A independently of the in call screen application in response to user input via touch sensitive screen region . This means that user input via touch sensitive screen region will be passed to other application software of MS A rather than to the in call screen application displaying the in call screen below the overlay portion e.g. pressing touch sensitive screen region will not provide a user input of the dial pad digit 9 to the in call screen application but rather will be passed to other application software of MS A for processing.

Embodiments therefore allow other tasks to be initiated on MS A which do not involve sending data associated with user input via the telephone call being conducted between MS A and the UA Telephone.

Embodiments therefore allow other tasks to be initiated on MS A which do not involve sending data associated with user input via the communication session established between MS A and data communications part .

In embodiments touch screen user interface will be reconfigured to display touch sensitive screen regions upon establishment of the separate communication session. However touch screen user interface may not be reconfigured to display touch sensitive screen region until some time later during the call between the user of MS A and the user agent operator of service provider system .

To help draw the attention of the user of MS A to the fact that reconfiguration of touch screen user interface to display touch sensitive screen region has occurred the at least first part of touch screen user interface can display touch sensitive screen regions in a first display mode and the at least second part of touch screen user interface can display touch sensitive screen region in a second display mode. The different display modes allow a user of MS A to more easily distinguish between the different touch sensitive screen regions.

The second display mode could involve displaying touch sensitive screen region as a flashing icon whereas the first display mode could involve displaying touch sensitive screen regions as non flashing icons. Alternatively the second display mode could involve displaying touch sensitive screen region as a wobbling icon whereas the first display mode could involve displaying touch sensitive screen regions as still icons.

In the embodiments described above in relation to predetermined configuration data is transmitted to MS A in order to reconfigure at least a first part of its touch screen user interface. The reconfiguration results in one or more touch sensitive screen regions being added to the screen in the form of a number of icons or buttons . The user of MS A can touch the on screen icons in order to initiate a variety of tasks associated with the service being provided by the service provider. The icons thus function as items of a menu from which the user of MS A can select actions of their choosing.

These embodiments also involve dynamic configuration data being generated and transmitted to MS A in order to reconfigure at least a second part of its touch screen user interface such that one or more additional touch sensitive screen regions are added to the screen in the form of a number of additional icons or buttons . The additional icons thus function as additional items in the menu. Embodiments therefore provide processes by which the list of menu items can be expanded or otherwise modified. Embodiments therefore allow dynamic updating of the menu according to events which occur during the call between the user of MS A and the user agent operator of the service provider.

In the embodiments described above in relation to configuration data can include positional data defining one or more positions or locations within touch screen user interface at which the touch sensitive screen regions should be configured. The configuration data can also include image data relating to the appearance of an icon for example an icon containing a logo associated with the service provider and text data helping clarify what function s the icon is associated with.

In the embodiments described above in relation to data communications part notifies the call to UA Telephone in steps and respectively. In alternative embodiments the call may instead be notified to server by one or more network entities located in PSTN B in a similar manner to the notification processes described above for network element and SCP .

Embodiments involve a service provider system capable of establishing a communications session for communication of data with respect to at least a first telephony user device MS A in a data communications network the system comprising 

a telephony part UA Telephone adapted to conduct a telephone call with a customer of the service provider via the at least first telephony user device MS A and

The retrieved service data may be retrieved from data store and data including or derived from the retrieved service data transmitted by the data communications part in response to establishment of the session.

The data communications part may retrieve and transmit the data including or derived from the service data in response to data input via a user agent computing device part associated with the user agent operator conducting the call with the user of MS A.

In embodiments data communications part may modify the retrieved service data from the service data store before transmittal via the session. The modification could be carried out on the basis of data input via the user agent computing device part. Alternatively or in addition the modification could be carried out on the basis of data received via the session for example data received from MS A and or server .

The data including or derived from the retrieved service data could be transmitted to MS A in the form of predetermined configuration data via the separate communication session as described above in relation to .

The data including or derived from the retrieved service data could be transmitted to MS A in the form of dynamic configuration data via the separate communication session as described above in relation to .

Some example applications of embodiments described above in relation to are now given. The example applications involve a call between a user of MS A and a user agent operator in a service provider system. A separate communications session is established between MS A data communications part and a user agent computing device associated with the user agent operator. The example applications also include some example interactions as per item depicted in .

In a first example application the service provider is providing a taxi service and the service provider system has received a call from the user of MS A which is distributed to a user agent telephony device associated with the user agent operator accordingly. In such embodiments the service provider will typically want to obtain some information on the physical location of MS A such that the service provider knows where to send a taxi to meet the user of MS A. In such an embodiment the service provider has predetermined configuration data which upon establishment of the separate communication session is transmitted to MS A. The predetermined configuration data instructs MS A to reconfigure its touch screen user interface with a touch sensitive screen region in an at least first part of the screen.

The touch sensitive screen region is operable to initiate generation of geographical location data associated with the physical location of MS A and transmit data including or derived from the generated geographical location data via the separate communication session. The touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Send location .

During the call the user agent operator can thus ask the user of MS A to press the Send location icon which results in the physical location of MS A being generated and transmitted from MS A to data communications part . Embodiments thus provide a convenient way for the service provider to obtain the location of the user of MS A without having to ask the user for address information verbally over the telephone and also avoids the user agent operator from having to enter in such information into the service provider system via a user agent computing device.

Once the location data is received at the user agent computing device the user agent operator can process a taxi booking for the user of MS A based on the received location data. The user agent operator may request retrieval of appropriate service data from service provider data store by appropriate input via the agent position computing device. In this case the retrieved service data could comprise service data including a taxi number for the booking and also service data associated with a live Estimated Time of Arrival ETA service for the booked taxi.

The retrieved service data is then modified on the basis of the location data received from MS A and transmitted as dynamic configuration data to MS A via the separate communication session. Upon receipt of the dynamic configuration data at MS A the touch screen user interface of MS A can be reconfigured accordingly. The reconfiguration may involve configuration of a further touch sensitive screen region in an at least second part of the screen.

The further touch sensitive screen region could be operable to initiate navigation via a browser application to a network address such as an IP address or URL associated with provision of the live ETA service for example a network address of data communications part . The further touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Press for Live taxi ETA service .

During the call the user agent operator can thus ask the user of MS A to press the Press for Live taxi ETA service icon which results in a browser application on MS A opening a webpage displaying information on a live ETA for their booked taxi.

In a second example application the service provider is providing a restaurant table booking service and the service provider system has received a call from the user of MS A which is distributed to a telephony user device associated with a user agent operator accordingly. In such embodiments the service provider will typically want to obtain contacts details for the user of MS A for example in order to know which name to book the table under and or an email address to send a table booking confirmation email to.

In these embodiments the service provider has predetermined configuration data which upon establishment of the separate communication session is transmitted to MS A. The predetermined configuration data instructs MS A to reconfigure its touch screen user interface with a touch sensitive screen region in an at least first part of the screen. The touch sensitive screen region is operable to initiate transmittal of contact data associated with a user of MS A via said session for example by obtaining such details from address book application data stored on MS A. The touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Send contact details or Send vCard .

During the call the user agent operator can thus ask the user of MS A to press the Send contact details icon which results in contact details for the user of MS A being transmitted from MS A to data communications part . Embodiments thus provide a convenient way for the service provider to obtain the contact details of the user of MS A without having to ask the user for the contact details verbally over the telephone and also avoids the user agent operator from having to enter in such information into the service provider system via a user agent computing device.

Once the contact details for the user of MA A are received at the user agent computing device the user agent operator can process a table booking for the user of MS A based on the received contact details. The user agent operator may initiate retrieval of appropriate service data from service provider data store . In this case the retrieved service data could comprise service data relating to a representation of available tables in the restaurant at which the user of MS A wishes to book a table.

The retrieved service data can then be transmitted as dynamic configuration data to MS A via the separate communication session. Upon receipt of the dynamic configuration data at MS A the touch screen user interface of MS A can be reconfigured accordingly. The reconfiguration may involve configuration of a further touch sensitive screen region in an at least second part of the screen.

The further touch sensitive screen region could be operable to initiate navigation via a browser application to a network address associated with provision of a table choosing service for example a network address of data communications part . The further touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Press to choose your table .

During the call the user agent operator can thus ask the user of MS A to press the Press to choose table icon which results in a browser application on MS A opening a webpage which allows the user of MS A to see the layout of the restaurant and select a table of their choosing.

Service providers responsible for processing emergency calls could employ a combination of the above two example applications of embodiments in order to reconfigure a part of the touch screen user interface which is operable to initiate transmittal of both geographical location data associated with the physical location of MS A and contact details such as name national insurance number etc. to data communications part . Allowing a user to transmit their location and contact details to the emergency call processing service provider at the click of one icon could save valuable time associated with an ambulance or fire engine reaching the location of an accident or fire.

In a third example application the service provider is providing a ticket purchasing service for example music concert or cinema tickets and the service provider system has received a call from the user of MS A which is distributed to a telephony user device associated with a user agent operator accordingly. In such embodiments the service provider will typically want to obtain contact details of the user of MS A and a payment for the tickets from the user of MS. In such an embodiment the service provider has predetermined configuration data which upon establishment of the separate communication session is transmitted to MS A. The predetermined configuration data instructs MS A to reconfigure its touch screen user interface with one or more touch sensitive screen regions in an at least first part of the screen.

One touch sensitive screen region could comprise an icon labeled Pay for tickets . The touch sensitive screen region is operable to initiate processing of a transaction from an account associated with a user of said first telephony user device via said session. The region may extract payment details from a data store of MS A and contact a secure payment server in packet network at which the appropriate funds can be deducted from the user s credit card or PayPal account or suchlike.

Another touch sensitive screen region could comprise an icon labeled Send contact details the functioning of which has been described above.

During the call the user agent operator can thus ask the user of MS A to press the Pay for tickets which results in payment for the tickets being processed and notified to data communications part and press the Send contact details which results in contact details for the user of MS A being transmitted from MS A to data communications part . Alternatively a single icon could be configured to provide both functions.

Embodiments thus provide a convenient way for the service provider to obtain the payment and contact details from the user of MS A without having to verbally ask the user for such over the telephone and also avoids the user agent operator from having to enter in such information into the service provider system via a user agent computing device.

Once the payment has been processed confirmation of such is notified at the user agent computing device and the user agent operator can process posting of the tickets to the user of MS A using an address contained in the received contact details.

The user agent operator may initiate retrieval of appropriate service data from service provider data store . In this case the retrieved service data could comprise service data relating to the electronic tickets for the ticket purchase.

The retrieved service data can then be modified on the basis of the contact detail data for example an email address received from MS A and transmitted as dynamic configuration data to MS A via the separate communication session. Upon receipt of the dynamic configuration data at MS A the touch screen user interface of MS A can be reconfigured accordingly. The reconfiguration may involve configuration of a further touch sensitive screen region in an at least second part of the screen.

The further touch sensitive screen region could be operable to initiate emailing of electronic tickets to an email address contained in the contact details received via the session. The further touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Press to be emailed tickets .

The further touch sensitive screen region could be operable to initiate transmittal via an SMS message of electronic tickets to a phone number contained in the contact details received via the session. The further touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Press to receive tickets by SMS .

The service provider associated with the above described third example application could also benefit from seat choosing functionality which allows a customer to select which seats in the appropriate event venue they would like. The seat choosing functionality could function in a similar manner as described above in relation to the second example application via transmittal of dynamic configuration data to MS A. Alternatively the seat choosing functionality could be configured via transmittal of predetermined configuration data to MS A.

In a fourth example application the service provider is a retail vendor selling one or more products or services. In such an application an image of a product the user of MS A is considering purchasing can be transmitted to MS A and displayed on the screen of MS A. Dynamic configuration data can be generated by data communications part and transmitted to MS A in order to reconfigure the touch screen user interface of MS A to display a touch sensitive screen region related to the purchase of the product in an at least second part of the screen. The further touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Buy me which can be configured to be embedded into the displayed image of the product.

In a fifth example application the service provider is a retail vendor selling one or more spare part products. The user of MS A transmits an image of a broken spare part which needs replacing to data communications part via the separate communications session. MS A thus requests dynamic configuration data from data communications part .

The service provider can then select an appropriate part and generate dynamic configuration data to transmit to MS A to reconfigure its touch screen user interface to display a Buy me icon or suchlike. The dynamic configuration data may include an image of the spare part which the service provider is proposing that the user of MS A purchases allowing the user of MS A to confirm visually that the spare part is the correct spare part.

In a sixth example application when a user of MS A calls service provider system instead of the call being distributed by ACD to an available user agent operator the user of MS A is directed to an IVR system with the aim of connecting the user to a suitable user agent operator. Such an Interactive Voice Response IVR system could prompt the user of MS A to navigate through a menu system using a series of digit key presses on the dialpad for example press 1 for technical support press 2 for billing etc. with the user having to wait and listen for each of the options for each stage of the menu system. Such IVR systems can be cumbersome and slow to use so the dynamic reconfiguration functionality of embodiments can be employed to allow the user to be redirected to a web based alternative.

In this example application dynamic configuration data can be generated by data communications part and transmitted to MS A in order to reconfigure the touch screen user interface of MS A to display a touch sensitive screen region related to redirection to a web alternative for an IVR in an at least second part of the screen. The touch sensitive screen region could for example comprise an icon labeled Go to website alternative of IVR icon. The icon is configured upon user touch input on the icon to initiate navigation via a browser application to a network address in the data communications network. The network address in this case directs the user to a web based alternative to the standard voice based IVR system. The web based alternative allows a user to read the various options for each stage of the menu system on screen and press digits accordingly. Navigation of the menu system according to embodiments will tend to be quicker than the user having to wait and listen for each of the options for each stage of a standard voice based IVR menu system.

Embodiments involve multi party conference calls between more than two user telephony devices. In such embodiments a separate communication session is established between the more than two telephony devices and or associated computing devices for the communication of data between devices associated with all parties of the conference call. Such embodiments can be implemented by allocation of a conference identifier to a multiparty call for example by server . The conference identifier along with a conference call telephone dialing number can be circulated around the multiple call parties.

In some embodiments server includes conference call hosting functionality in which case the conference call telephone dialing number may comprise a telephone dialing number associated with a conference call hosting module within server . Alternatively the conference call telephone dialing number may comprise a telephone dialing number associated with a dedicated conference call hosting entity within packet network .

Each conference call party will dial the conference call telephone dialing number and enter the conference identifier. The parties will thus be able to conduct a teleconference voice call.

A separate communication session is then established between the user device of each party to the conference call and server . Each user device will connect to server using a client server connection request response procedure. Each user will then enter in the conference identifier which allows server to disambiguate which conference a device should be connected to. Once each device has established a separate communication session with server any party to the conference call is able to transmit or receive data with any other party to the conference call. Data transmitted from one user device will pass to server and can be replicated and distributed to other user devices party to the conference call accordingly by server . Server may employ multicast techniques such as IP multicast to efficiently transfer data to multiple devices.

Voicemail is a useful tool that allows people calling a busy or otherwise unavailable telephone number to leave a message for the called party that they will be able to collect later. However many callers would prefer to send a message such as a text message rather than leave a voicemail because a text message is easier and quicker to receive and it is less disruptive to read a text message than to call a voicemail service and pick up a call. Accordingly when diverted to a voicemail service many people hang up the phone and send a text message instead.

Embodiments described below in relation to provide convenient methods by which a calling party who is trying to speak to a user of a called party device is given the option to send a message to the called party as an alternative to leaving a voicemail for the called party. Other embodiments described below in relation to provide convenient methods by which a calling party who is trying to speak to a user of a called party device is given the option to send media data such as one or more files for subsequent retrieval by the called party as an alternative to leaving a voicemail for the called party.

The user of MS A attempts to call MS B but the call attempt is unsuccessful. The call attempt might have failed for a number of reasons for example the user of MS B did not want to or could not answer the call MS B is currently switched off etc. The call is therefore redirected to an automated system and a call between MS A and automated system is established as shown by item .

Under normal circumstances automated system may play an audio message such Bob cannot take your call right now please leave a message after the tone . The user of MS A may not want to leave a voicemail message so might hang up. However according to embodiments the user of MS A is given one or more options other than leaving a voicemail message.

Application software running on MS A detects that there is a call in progress between MS A and automated system and notifies server of call party details for the call in step

The call party details may comprise a TDN A associated with MS A and TDN B associated with MS B. The call party details may comprise an identifier associated with automated system .

Automated system detects the call in progress between itself and MS A and notifies server of call party details for the call in step

Server identifies that the notification of step from MS A and notification of step from automated system have call party details in common and establishes a separate communications session separate from the telephone call for the communication of data between MS A and server as shown by item . The separate communications session is established on the basis of the received call party details.

Server retrieves configuration data from data store in steps and and transmits the configuration data on to MS A via the separate communications session in step

The configuration data indicates that the telephone call is with an automated system in this case automated system . MS A therefore knows that the call is with an automated system and reconfigures at least a part of the graphical user interface in accordance with the configuration data received via the separate communication session.

In these embodiments the reconfigurable graphical user interface of MS A comprises a touch screen user interface and the reconfiguration comprises configuring one or more touch sensitive screen regions in the at least part of the touch screen user interface. The one or more touch sensitive screen regions are operable to initiate one or more operations of MS A in response to user input via the one or more touch sensitive screen regions.

In some embodiments one of the touch sensitive regions is operable to open a messaging application on MS A and instruct the messaging application to create a new message. The touch sensitive region may be displayed in the form of an icon with accompanying text for example Send message to called party .

When the user of MS A presses the touch sensitive region a messaging application on MS A is initiated and a new message window is open. The messaging application may for example comprise a Short Message Service SMS application a Multimedia Message Service MMS application or an email application.

The user of MS A can then type text into the body field of the message. Once the user of MS A has finished typing in the message the user presses a send key or similar and the message is transmitted to MS B in step

In embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is further operable to insert an identity associated with the intended recipient user device into a destination field of the new message. The user of MS A therefore does not need to enter in the required identity into the message.

The identity may comprise a telephony dialing number an email address or a Session Initiation Protocol Uniform Resource Identifier SIP URI . The identity may be transmitted from the automated system as part of the configuration data or retrieved from local storage on the device.

In some embodiments the one or more touch sensitive region is further operable to insert predetermined text into the body field of the new message. The predetermined text may for example include a commonly used text template such as Hi Bob I tried to call you just now but didn t get through. Please call me back when you are free . The user of MS A therefore does not need to enter in the predetermined text. The predetermined text may be transmitted from the automated system as part of the configuration data or retrieved from local storage on the device.

In other embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct said automated system to terminate said call. Hence the user can choose not to send a message or leave a voicemail and end the call. Rather than ending the call using the telephony application on the user device it may be more convenient for the user to initiate the termination of the call via one of the touch sensitive regions and this can be used to trigger the automated system to end the call on behalf of the user. In any case in some operating systems it may not be possible to cause the device itself to terminate the call from within an application. In such a scenario a message for example a SIP INFO message instructing termination of the call can be transmitted to automated system and the call can be terminated from the automated system .

In one embodiment one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct the automated system to initiate recordal of a voice message.

In embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate playback of a voice message. In embodiments the voice message to be played back was recorded via the telephony user device MS A this function can therefore be used by the user who recorded the voice message e.g. the user of MS A to allow the user to listen to their message and check that it contains the correct information. In alternative embodiments the message to be played back was previously recorded via a device other than the telephony user device which was used to record the voice message this function can therefore be used by a user of another telephony user device e.g. MS B to retrieve the voice message from the voicemail system.

In embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate re recordal of a voice message recorded via the telephony user device this function can therefore be used by the user who recorded the voicemail to allow the user to re record the voice message they previously left for example because the original voice message contains incorrect or insufficient information than intended.

In embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate deletion of a voice message this function can therefore be used by the user e.g. the user of MS A who recorded the voicemail to allow the user to delete the voice message they previously recorded. In alternative embodiments the voice message to be deleted was previously recorded via a device other than the telephony user device this function can therefore allow a user e.g. the user of MS B to delete a message e.g. previously recorded by the user of MS A after they have retrieved it from the voicemail system and listened to its contents.

In embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate a rewind operation during playback of a voice message previously recorded via a device other than the telephony user device. In embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate a fast forward operation during playback of a voice message previously recorded via a device other than the telephony user device. In embodiments one of the one or more touch sensitive regions is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate a pause operation during playback of a voice message previously recorded via a device other than the telephony user device. Such functionality allows a user e.g. the user of MS B retrieving a voice message recorded by another user e.g. the user of MS A from the voicemail system to control the flow of playback of voice media during retrieval of the voice message from the voicemail system for example to listen to an excerpt of the message more than once for example to skip through excerpts of the message without listening to them or stall the playback momentarily etc.

In these embodiments instead of wanting to send a message to MS B the user of MS A wishes to convey one or more files to MS B.

Server receives call party details for a telephone call established between MS A and automated system . A separate communications session separate from the telephone call for the transfer of data to from MS A is established on the basis of one or more call party details associated with the telephone call. Sever retrieves configuration data from data store in steps and and transmits the configuration data to MS A in step

The configuration data instructs MS A to reconfigure at least a part of its graphical user interface as shown in step

In some embodiments the at least part is configured to include a touch sensitive region which is operable to open a file browsing application on MS A. The user of MS A can thus select one or more files by appropriate user input to the file browsing application. The one or more selected files are then transmitted to server via the separate communication session in step which stores the files in data store in step . The one or more files received via the session are stored in data store in association with one or more call party details associated with the telephone call which enables the one or more files to be identified correctly for subsequent retrieval.

In embodiments automated system comprises a voicemail system. In the case that one party is not available the caller will be diverted to the voicemail system of the callee and will not be able to share any media. Equally when the callee picks up the voice message or voicemail they cannot access any of the media the caller could have shared with them had they actually had a telephone call and associated established communication session. However embodiments described below provide advanced voice mailbox functionality such that in addition to containing audio the capability to store different forms of content for example a picture or details of a contact is also provided. A caller can thus in effect attach media to a voice message and when a callee picks up the voice message they can view the attached media.

In embodiments server receives notification from the voicemail system at the start of recordal of a voice message. Such notification informs server that such has been received from a voicemail system rather than a telephony user device and server establishes a communication session with the caller s telephony user device and reconfigures its user interface accordingly. Similarly in embodiments server receives a notification from the voicemail system at the start of retrieval of a voice message informing server that such has been received from a voicemail system rather than a telephony user device and server establishes a communication session with the callee s telephony user device and reconfigures its user interface accordingly.

Once server is notified of a call between a caller telephony user device during recordal of a voice message and the voicemail system and establishes a separate communication session with the caller s telephony user device server transmits appropriate configuration data to the caller s telephony user device to reconfigure its graphical user interface accordingly. Similarly once server is notified of a call between a callee telephony user device during retrieval of a previously recorded voice message from the voicemail system and establishes a separate communication session with the callee s telephony user device server transmits appropriate configuration data to the callee telephony user device to reconfigure its graphical user interface accordingly.

In alternative embodiments instead of server receiving notification from the voicemail system that recordal of a voice message has begun server only receives notification that the call in question has gone to voicemail. Server then establishes a communication session with the caller telephony user device on the basis of the call party details received from the voicemail system. A similar process is carried out by server during retrieval of a voice message by the callee telephony user device.

In embodiments MS A receives user input selecting one or more files and transmits the one or more selected files via the session to server whilst the user of MS A is recording a voice message at the voicemail system via a telephone call. The one or more files could comprise a variety of different media such as image data video data contact data geographical location data etc.

In embodiments server stores time stamp data associated with at least one of the one or more files received from MS A in data store . In embodiments the time stamp data is stored in data store in association with the one or more files and one or more call party details stored in data store .

In embodiments the time stamp data is associated with the time of transmittal of the one or more files from MS A. In embodiments MS A transmits time stamp data via the session to server during recordal of the voice message. In embodiments the time stamp data is indicative of the time at which the one or more selected files are transmitted to server . In embodiments MS A transmits the time stamp data to server in conjunction with transmittal of the one or more files to server .

In embodiments the time stamp data relates to the time at which recordal of the voice message began at the voicemail system.

In embodiments the time stamp data is associated with the time of receipt of the one or more files at server . In embodiments server generates at least part of the time stamp data upon receipt of the one or more files.

In other embodiments the at least part is configured to include a touch sensitive region which is operable to instruct a geographical location module application on the telephony user device to generate geographical location data relating to the physical location of the telephony user device and transmit data including or derived from the generated geographical location data via the session. Such embodiments could for example allow the user of MS A to send in image file in the form of a map containing their current location to the user of B.

These embodiments occur after the steps carried out in i.e. the user of MS A has sent one or more files to server for subsequent retrieval by the user of MS B. These embodiments involve the user of MS B retrieving the one or more files from server .

The user of MS B dials the number for automated system and a call is established between MS B and automated system as shown by item .

Automated system detects the call in progress between itself and MS B and notifies server of call party details for the call in step

Server establishes a separate communications session separate from the telephone call between MS B and automated system for the transfer of data to from MS B as shown by item . The separate communications session is established on the basis of one or more call party details associated with the telephone call.

Server performs a lookup in data store in step for files stored in association with MS B and retrieves one or more such files in step . Server transmits the files retrieved in step to MS B via the separate communications session in step

In embodiments automated system comprises a voicemail system. In such embodiments the established telephone call comprises a user of a telephony user device e.g. MS B retrieving a voice message from the voicemail system.

In embodiments the voice message was left for retrieval by the user of MS B by the user of MS A. In addition to leaving a voice message the user of MS A also uploaded one or more files to server via a communication session established between their telephony device e.g. MS A and server for later retrieval by the user of MS B. Server stored the files transmitted via the session in data store as described above in relation to .

In embodiments the one or more files were transmitted from MS A during recordal of the voice message by the user of MS A and server stored time stamp data in association with at least one of the one or more stored files for example as metadata for the one or more stored files. The time stamp data may for example be based at least in part on the time at which the one or more files were stored by server .

In embodiments the one or more files are transmitted by server during retrieval of the voice message by MS B according to a schedule determined at least in part by the stored time stamp data.

Server may receive notification or other such trigger of the start of retrieval of the voice message and determine the schedule at least in part by the time of receipt of the notification. In some embodiments the notification is received from the telephony user device via the session whereas in alternative embodiments the notification is received from the voicemail system.

Embodiments therefore allow a schedule of file uploading in association with recordal of a voice message to substantially match a schedule for file downloading in association with retrieval of the voice message. This can enable for example the time at which a user of MS A uploaded a given file during recordal of a voice message to be substantially matched by the time at which the file is downloaded to MS B during retrieval playback of the given file by the user of MS B. Such time matching of uploading and downloading functionality is now described in relation to voice message recordal and file upload during such and voice message retrieval and file download during such .

The process of begins when Alice e.g. user of MS A makes a call to Bob e.g. user of MS B in step . Bob does not answer his telephone MS B so Alice is dropped into voicemail at automated system in step .

A separate communications session separate from the telephone call between MS A and the voicemail system is established for the transfer of data to from MS A and server on the basis of one or more call party details associated with the telephone call between MS A and the voicemail system. At least a part of a graphical user interface of MS A is reconfigured in accordance with configuration data relating to and or being derived from the voicemail system received via the separate communication session from server .

The reconfiguration comprises configuring on MS A a first touch sensitive region which is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate recordal of a voice message. The reconfiguration also comprises configuring on MS A a second touch sensitive region which is operable to open a file browsing application on MS A and in response to receipt via the file browsing application of user input selecting one or more files transmit the one or more selected files via the session to server during recordal of a voice message.

Alice selects the first configured touch sensitive region on MS A and records a voicemail in step as follows 

between 0 and 10 seconds during recordal of the voice message Alice speaks Hi Bob how s it going Here s that picture I mentioned. 

between 10 and 20 seconds during recordal of the voice message Alice selects the second configured touch sensitive region on MS A and uses the file browsing application to transmit a picture file from MS A to server via the session. When server receives the picture transmitted from MS A server stores the picture file in data store along with time stamp data for example time stamp data indicating the time during recordal of the voicemail at which the picture file was transmitted from MS A and

between 20 and 30 seconds during recordal of the voice message Alice speaks Hope you like it Bye and hangs up in step .

A separate communications session separate from the telephone call between MS B and the voicemail system is established for the transfer of data to from MS B and server on the basis of one or more call party details associated with the telephone call between MS B and the voicemail system. At least a part of a graphical user interface of MS B is reconfigured in accordance with configuration data relating to and or being derived from the voicemail system received via the separate communication session from server .

The reconfiguration comprises configuring on MS B a third touch sensitive region which is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate playback of a voice message.

Bob selects the third configured touch sensitive region on MS B and server begins in step to playback the voice message previously recorded by Alice the user of MS A .

During playback of the voice message to Bob server retrieves time stamp data stored in data store which is associated with the picture file previously uploaded by Alice. The time stamp data indicates that the picture file was uploaded at a particular time during recordal of the voice message by Alice. Server therefore retrieves the picture file and associated time stamp data from data store and timely transmits the picture to MS B such that it is displayed by MS B at 20 seconds after playback of the voice message to Bob begins in step . Such embodiments therefore allow Bob to view the picture file on MS B at the same time during retrieval of the voice message as Alice is talking about the picture file uploaded during recordal of the voice message.

Note that server may transmit the file to MS B earlier than the 20 second mark during playback of the voice message and inform MS B of the time at which the picture file should be displayed on MS B during playback of the corresponding voice message. This accommodates for any transmission delays that may occur between server and MS B and therefore avoids display of the picture file out of synchronization with playback of the voice message.

Some users may wish to download one or more files previously uploaded by another user from the voicemail system without having to listen to the corresponding voicemail i.e. playback of the voice message can be skipped but one or more files stored in association with a voice message can still be retrieved. The reconfiguring of the one or more touch sensitive regions can therefore involve configuring a touch sensitive region which is operable to instruct the voicemail system to initiate transmittal of one or more files stored in association with a previously recorded voice message but without initiating playback of the associated recorded voice message.

Embodiments described above include a user of a telephony user device MS A uploading one or more files to server whilst a voice message is being recorded where the one or more files are downloaded later by a user of a telephony user device MS B during retrieval of the voice message. In alternative embodiments instead of the files being uploaded to server the voicemail system is enhanced to enable it to carry out the file storage and retrieval capabilities of server described above. In such embodiments the one or more files are uploaded to the enhanced voicemail system which has a capability to store such files in association with the corresponding audio of the voice message along with any associated time stamp data. The enhanced voicemail system is also enhanced with a capability to retrieve such files and transmit them according to any associated time stamp data when the voice message is being retrieved. In such embodiments the enhanced voicemail system may notify server of message upload and download events such that server may reconfigure the user interface of MS A and or MS B accordingly.

In some embodiments the configuration data comprises one or more configuration settings. The one or more configuration settings indicate to MS A how it should reconfigure the at least part of its graphical user interface.

In other embodiments one or more configuration settings are stored locally to MS A. When MS A receives configuration data via the separate communication session MS A knows to refer to the one or more locally stored configuration settings in order to find out how to reconfigure the at least part of its graphical user interface.

In some embodiments the configuration data is generated by automated system and instead of establishing a separate communication session between server and MS A a communication session between MS A and automated system is established for the transmission of data to from MS A.

Capabilities of the various devices to handle receipt transmission of configuration data according to embodiments can be ascertained by transmittal of a SIP INFO message with an appropriate eXtensible Markup Language XML file embedded within it with a corresponding SIP OK response message being returned containing the capability information. Such SIP INFO messages may be transmitted from automated system to server from automated system to MS A and or from server to MS A.

The above embodiments are to be understood as illustrative examples of embodiments. Further embodiments are envisaged.

In the above described embodiments the automated system is a voicemail system. In alternative embodiments the automated system may take different forms.

In another embodiment the automated system may comprise an interactive voice response IVR unit with which the user interacts on a call. Configuration data associated with the IVR unit for example information resulting from an IVR interaction with the user may be used to alter the information displayed on the reconfigured user interface.

In another embodiment the automated system may comprise a conference call system with which the user interacts on a call. Configuration data associated with the conference call system for example a data entry screen requesting a conference call ID from the user may be displayed after the conference call system has been called by the user on a general conference calling number and a connection has been made. The conference call ID may then be collected and transmitted to the conference call system via the separate communications session.

The above described embodiments primarily relate to telephony devices having associated identities in the form of telephone dialing numbers. In other embodiments one or more or all of the identities could be non telephone dialing numbers for example usernames email addresses etc. Where non telephone dialing number identities are employed mappings between non telephone dialing number identities and telephone dialing number identities may be stored in data store and used by server for converting from non telephone dialing number identities to telephone dialing numbers after receipt of the call party details.

The personal computer PC A described above could alternatively be another device or combination of devices with corresponding data processing display and data input capabilities for example a television a smart television a general purpose desktop computer terminal a general purpose laptop computer terminal a general purpose tablet computer terminal an in car computing and communications system a satellite navigation system games console or any combination thereof.

In embodiments described above telephone calls to from mobile stations and POTS phones are detected either by application software running on the mobile stations or by a telephony apparatus configured accordingly. In alternative embodiments during a voice call a party to the call uses a computing terminal to enter in call party details for example the calling and called party telephone dialing numbers for the call via a web server interface. The web server interface passes the call party details to server which can then establish a communications session separate to the voice call on the basis of the calling and called party telephone dialing numbers received from the web server interface.

The logical coupling between user devices for a user may be temporary or more permanent. If for example a user has a POTS phone and a PC as their user devices in their home then these devices will tend to be used by the user on a fairly permanent basis so the logical coupling would tend to be more permanent. If for example a user has a mobile phone and a satellite navigation system in their car then the logical coupling between the two devices may only be valid when the user is in or near their car so the logical coupling would only be maintained temporarily when the two devices are within close enough proximity of each other.

The logical coupling between a user s devices can be activated or otherwise triggered by a variety of different processes. One example could involve communication between a smartphone and a satellite navigation system via a short wave radio interface such as a Bluetooth interface in order to couple the two devices together locally along with subsequent registration of details of such with server . Another example could be registration of device details via a website. A further example might involve registration by a service engineer when installing a telephone and set top box combination. Alternatively registration could be carried out over the telephone verbally to an administrative operator or via an Interactive Voice Response IVR system.

The above embodiments describe telephone calls and establishment of communications sessions for user devices of two parties. All embodiments can be applied to user devices of multiple parties numbering more than two. When the multiple parties are conducting a multi leg teleconference a communications session can be created between all of their user devices allowing communication of data not just between two user devices but between many different combinations of user devices i.e. multi branch data communication.

The connections between server and the user devices are described above as being HTTP or HTTPS connections. In alternative embodiments the connections could be peer to peer connections such that data is communicated between the user devices through a number of peer to peer nodes. Creating the peer to peer connections may involve use of processes for traversing firewalls for example using protocols such as the Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol UDP Through Network Address Translators NATs STUN protocol.

Further alternatively the connections could initially be created as HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and the user devices but then could be migrated to peer to peer connections according to network topography and or current network load.

Embodiments described above involve communication of different types of data during a communication session for example software component identifiers software applications feature identifiers authorization requests authorization indications geographical location data etc. Any of these different types of data may be communicated between the various combinations of devices in the above described embodiments including mobile station to mobile station and mobile station to PC both with or without use of telephony apparatus for call detection.

Embodiments described above allow a single predetermined affiliate such as a user of a device or a service provider to be associated with download of one or more files by a user of another device. In alternative embodiments both a user of a device and a service provider can be associated with download of one or more file by a user of another device.

The example embodiments described above in relation to include reconfiguration of a touch screen user interface mobile telephone device MS A. Embodiments can equally be applied to a mobile telephony device having a non touch sensitive screen in which case the reconfiguration can involve reconfiguring one or more soft keys accordingly.

In the above described embodiments both call parties transmit either from the telephony device or an associated device call party identifiers for each party to the server in the process of setting up the separate data communications session. These call party identifiers are in the embodiments described both telephony dialing numbers TDNs . In alternative embodiments one party or both parties may be identified by another form of call party identifier using for example one or more lookup mechanisms which map a telephony dialing number to a different unique identifier and or vice versa examples of such alternatives are described in further detail below. However such lookup mechanisms may increase latency and may introduce unexpected errors e.g. if a lookup database such as an address book is not kept up to date. Hence whilst it is not indeed necessary for either party to transmit a telephony dialing number of either party since either party may be identified by other mechanisms it is preferred that at least one of the devices includes the telephony dialing number of the other party. Indeed whilst it is again not necessary it is preferred that both parties transmit the telephony dialing number of the other party if available to the server during the session setup. Furthermore in order at least to reduce latency at the server and or to reduce the need to maintain a separate store of identities and or to reduce the need to implement a registration mechanism it is preferred that both parties transmit both their own telephony dialing number and the telephony dialing number of the other party if available to the server during the session setup. If a call party is identifiable using an additional identifier such as an extension number or a conference call ID the additional identifier may be transmitted in association with both of the telephony dialing numbers if available by one or each party to the call.

As mentioned above in alternative embodiments one or each of the call parties may transmit either from the telephony device or an associated device a unique identifier in the form other than that of a telephony dialing number which is nonetheless recognizable by the server . A user device which interacts with the server may thus transmit the unique identifier to identify one party or both parties as a party to the call instead of a telephony dialing number. For example the server may have access to a data store which includes a set of unique identifiers for all subscribers registered to receive the service provided by the server along with a corresponding telephony dialing number for a telephony device associated with each respective unique identifier. Such unique identifiers may be allocated by the server during an initial registration procedure and notified to and stored by an application on the user device which interacts with the server during the registration procedure. Other globally unique identifiers such as email addresses Facebook IDs etc. may be used alternatively or in addition to such allocated unique identifiers.

In embodiments at least one of the two call parties may use a Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP enabled device or other device employing the Session Initiation Protocol SIP . One or each party may be identified in the call setup procedures by means of a unique SIP user identifier which may include a telephone dialing number as a user identifier or a user identifier other than a telephony dialing number for example a SIP identifier in which the form of username hostname. Thus a SIP user identifier can be transmitted to the server as a call party identifier identifying at least one or each participant in the call.

In embodiments a call party identifier may take the form of an Internet Protocol IP address which may be either a static or dynamically allocated IP address. This may for example be the IP address which a user device transmits to the server in a client server connection setup request for example an HTTP setup request when establishing a leg of the communications session. This may uniquely identify the call party associated with the device making the request. If for example a given party sends the telephony dialing number of only the other party to the server in the session setup procedure then that given party can nevertheless be identified as a party to the call using the IP address of that given party s device used in establishing the session leg. The supplied IP address may then be used to send data to that given party s device throughout the ensuing communications session even if the IP address is only temporarily allocated to the user device as a dynamic IP address. Hence a static or dynamic IP address may be used in some embodiments to identify a call party and may be one of the call party identifiers which forms part of the call party details transmitted to the server e.g. in a connection setup request during session establishment.

In embodiments a call party identifier may take the form of a session identifier or other unique identifier generated by the server and received from the server by a user device in a push notification message. Such a push notification message may be sent from the server in response to the server receiving call party details from the other party to the call in a first communication session leg. The push notification message is configured on receipt to trigger the user device to set up a second communication session leg with the server . The user device may be configured to include the identifier received in the push notification as a call party identifier in a client server connection setup request for example an HTTP setup request when establishing the communications session leg in response to the push notification message. This may uniquely identify the call party associated with the device making the request since such identifier may be mapped to the telephony dialing number or other call party identifier by the server . Hence an identifier received in a push notification message may be used in some embodiments to identify a call party and may be one of the call party identifiers which forms part of the call party details transmitted to the server e.g. in a connection setup request during session establishment.

A unique identifier in any of the various forms described above in a form other than that of a telephony dialing number may be used to identify a given party to the call in call party details transmitted by a user device associated with that given party. A unique identifier in any of the various forms described in a form other than that of a telephony dialing number may in addition or in the alternative be used to identify another party to the call in call party details transmitted by that given party. The server may supply the unique identifiers of other parties using e.g. a synchronization process for populating an address book locally stored on the user device with such identifiers. Alternatively such unique identifiers of other parties may already be stored by or manually added by a user of the device in the local address book. Further alternatively the unique identifiers may be stored in a global address book stored on a remote device. At least one of the two parties may have a user device which is configured to look up from a local data store e.g. a local address book or a remote data store e.g. a global address book a correspondence between the other party s telephone dialing number or other received unique identifier and a different unique identifier. The different unique identifier may then be used instead to identify the other party to the call in the call party details transmitted by at least one side of the call to the server .

In the above various forms of alternative call party identifiers are described. Whatever form the supplied unique identifier takes the server may have a corresponding database and lookup mechanism to map a supplied unique identifier to a different call party identifier such as a telephony dialing number whereby to match both session legs together as relating to a particular current telephone call using the information supplied in each respective one of the session legs. The server can then bridge the two session legs together or otherwise associate the two session legs to create a separate communications session between the participants in a currently ongoing call.

In the above described embodiments whilst a different form of call party identifier may be used in some cases in a generally accessible telephony system at least one of the two parties may have no access to identifying details other than the telephony dialing number of the other call party when the call is established. Hence the system may be configured such that at least one of the two parties may transmit the call party identifier of the other party to the server in the form of a telephony dialing number and that the server is able to process one or more call party details in such a form in order to establish the separate communications session.

In alternative embodiments rather than both call parties transmitting both calling party and called party identifiers to identify the parties to a call at least one of the parties may transmit only one of the two call party identifiers to the server . This may be done according to a predetermined convention e.g. a convention which determines that the calling party should always transmit both identifiers but the called party need only transmit one identifier or vice versa . Again the server is nevertheless able to match both session legs together as relating to a particular current telephone call using the information supplied in both of the session legs. In this case it is sufficient that at least one common call participant namely that participant which is determined by convention to be identified by each party to the call has been identified in each session leg.

In some circumstances the telephony dialing number or other call party identifier of the other party may not be received at all during the call setup procedures. For example the other party may use a number withholding service. Hence an identifier for the other party may not be available to the user device. In this case the user device may be able during the setup of the separate communications session to identify only its associated call party and not the other call party to the server as a party to the call. However providing both sides of the call do not use a number withholding service the other party s device may be able identify both parties to the call and may transmit call party details identifying both call parties to the server during session establishment. Again the server is nevertheless able to match both session legs together as relating to a particular current telephone call using the information supplied in both of the session legs. Again in this case it is sufficient that at least one common call participant namely the participant not using a number withholding service has been identified in both session legs.

In the above described embodiments the mobile stations MS A MS B communicate via a PLMN. Such a PLMN may be any of a variety of different cellular communications network types including a 2G network such as a Global System for Mobile communications GSM network a 3G network such as a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS network or a 4G network such as a Long Term Evolution LTE or LTE Advanced network. Whilst the call setup and call data flow may be conducted via the PLMN the communications relating to the separate data communications session e.g. communications with the server may be conducted via a different radio access network RAN such as a wireless local area network WLAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.

In the above described embodiments the server is described as a single computing device located in a single network location. However it should be understood that the server may consist of a distributed set of computing devices or applications either co located in a single network location or dispersed in different network locations.

It is to be understood that any feature described in relation to any one embodiment may be used alone or in combination with other features described and may also be used in combination with one or more features of any other of the embodiments or any combination of any other of the embodiments. Furthermore equivalents and modifications not described above may also be employed without departing from the scope of embodiments which is defined in the accompanying claims.
