This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 594 550 filed on 3 Feb. 2012 which is incorporated in its entirety by this reference.

This invention relates generally to the retail marketing management field and more specifically to a new and useful system and method for automated retail product accounting in the retail marketing management field.

The average large grocery market or big box store has tens of thousands of products stocked and salable at any given point. There are very few companies and organizations that track customer preference data using actual purchases across different retailers from which the efficacy of any packaging display and or marketing efforts within any particular retail location can be evaluated. Tracking this data is typically gathered using UPC bar code scanners distributed to selected consumers who then upload the scanned data to a remote computer for analysis and sale to the manufacturers. Unfortunately this method is highly unreliable as consumers typically fail to scan all purchased items fail to account for multiple purchases of the same item fail to account for discounts coupons and rebates and often fail to reliably transmit the partially acquired data to the remote computer. Moreover in consideration for the efforts of the consumer to assist in the market analysis they are typically compensated both too little and too late further increasing the lack of reliability of their acquired data because the consumer has little incentive to scan in products from each and every shopping trip. Accordingly there is a need in the art for a system and method for automatically acquiring analyzing distributing and managing such consumer panel data or consumer scan panel data. This invention provides such a new and useful system and method.

The following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to these preferred embodiments but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention.

As shown in a method for automated retail product accounting of a preferred embodiment can include collecting image data of a purchase receipt S converting image data to machine readable data S generating a receipt model including at least one line item from the machine readable data S selecting a product profile to associate with a line item through a receipt heuristic S and accounting for the selected product profile of the line item S. The preferred method functions to enable manufacturers and or other entities to gather reliable product data from one or more consumers users while ensuring that the data is accurate complete and consistent. The method preferably uses captured receipt images that are automatically transformed into data models of product purchases. In one preferred embodiment the method can further function to incentivize users to collect data by delivering feedback to the user which can include financial incentives or rewards for participating in the data generation. In another preferred embodiment the method can further function to provide a service that provides information about receipt images to outside applications and or merchants. The method preferably leverages receipt specific patterns and data to enable reliable translation of images to product purchase data. Furthermore as the product purchase data is based on a physical proof of purchase e.g. the paper receipt the method can generate highly reliable consumer purchase data. Preferably the method described herein can be performed by one or more of a user s mobile device and or a remote server although other components can be substituted and or added to a functional system as described further below.

Step S which includes collecting image data of a purchase receipt functions to import retrieve acquire and or receive image data such as an image of a shopping receipt which represents the user s retail behavior. Preferably the image data can include an image of a receipt captured by the user using a mobile device such as a mobile phone tablet computer digital camera laptop computer fixed or mobile scanner or any other suitable imaging device. In one variation of the preferred method the image data can be acquired using a mobile phone and transmitted to a remote server by an application. Image data may be processed in part or entirely on the mobile phone and similarly the image data may be processed in part or entirely on a remote server. In another variation of a preferred method the image data is received at a remote server the image data submitted over a provided API.

Step S which includes converting image data to machine readable data functions to convert a receipt image into a parsable translation of receipt information. The machine readable data is preferably machine readable text data but may additionally include other information such as graphic identifiers e.g. company name corresponding to a logo . Preferably a suitable receipt processing service operable on a personal computing device or a server can function in part to process or preprocess the image data from raw image data e.g. JPEG MPEG etc. into a machine readable format using any suitable technique including but not limited to optical character recognition OCR . In particular the preferred method can include determining whether the image includes text in it and is thus a candidate for a receipt. Additionally the preferred method can include stitching one or more images together of the same item such as different views of the same receipt in order to optimize the image quality for any native or remote OCR process. In another variation of the preferred method the receipt processing service can automatically enhance the image for native or remote OCR which can include processing an image saturation brightness contrast rotation or any other suitable aspect or feature of the image. In another variation of the preferred method the receipt processing service can function to map areas of importance within the image such as columns rows headers and the like. Preferably the receipt processing service can include a local database of suitable logos against which to compare the image and readily determine the source of the purchased goods. Any ambiguities or errors in converting image data are preferably resolved through Step S and S. Any or all of the foregoing functions or aspects of Step S can be readily performed by one or more of a user device or a remote server.

Step S which includes generating a receipt model including at least one line item from the machine readable data functions to structure the receipt text into a standardized format. The receipt model is preferably structured as a receipt definition language RDL description that includes specific formats and concepts particular to each retailers receipts such as store name store location receipt timestamp discounts loyalty reward coupons multiple purchases of a single item and or variable weight items. The RDL may be substantially similar to a markup language or structured text description such as XML JSON or any suitable data structure. The generated receipt model preferably further functions to standardize the content of variously formatted receipts from multiple retailers or even different locations of a single retailer. Generating a receipt model can be performed at one or both of a user device or a remote server either in part or in its entirety. Preferably Step S can include mapping a retail banner identifying the retailer and a store identifier to a local database and additionally a phone number or address of the store location. Step S can preferably further function to extract one or more fields from the receipt text including for example purchase amounts UPC codes product descriptions variable weight item descriptions weights and the like. Step S can further preferably return and perform successive iterations of analysis on the text to collapse related lines into a single line item purchased to sum up multiple quantities and to identity all known tags for the aforementioned fields as well as any unknown tags or attributes on the receipt such as taxes for example. An example input and output for Step S is shown in . A line item of a receipt model will preferably identify and set as parameters of a line item a product description e.g. a name code abbreviation etc. and other metadata such as quantity product metrics and price. The product metrics preferably include any suitable description of packaging type weight volume size form factor or other suitable forms of quantifying the product unit.

Step S which includes selecting a product profile to associate with a line item through a receipt heuristic functions to associate correlate register and or map the receipt model data with master data for the products. A receipt processing service operable on one or both of a user mobile device or remote server in part or in its entirety preferably selects a product profile for each line item of a receipt model. The line items are preferably extracted when converting image data to machine readable text data and generating the receipt model. The product profile selected is preferably a profile that corresponds to the product purchased or that is predicted to correspond to the line item. Step S is preferably performed iteratively to select product profiles for each line item in the receipt model. A receipt heuristic is preferably a receipt model processing sequence which may include querying matching item lookup approximate string matching i.e. fuzzy search machine learning crowdsourcing and or any suitable form of receipt model processing to identify a corresponding product. A receipt heuristic will typically rely on matching criteria specific to the format of typical paper receipts. In some cases a receipt heuristic may be tailored for a specific store such as encoding the formatting and labels of a particular merchant . Two stores will often sell the same products but the stores will represent the same product in varying receipt formats. A receipt heuristic preferably matches a store specific item representation to a universal product profile.

If no product is found to correspond to the line item then a new product profile may be created using information from the line item. Alternatively the line item may be skipped marked to be analyzed by a crowdsource user marked to be reattempted at a later time when more data is obtained and or treated in any suitable manner.

Selecting a product profile through a receipt heuristic preferably functions to account for complications in matching items in a receipt with actual products. For example the receipt model preferably includes text data that is an accurate translation of the text on the physical receipt but during the generation of the machine readable text data inaccuracies may occur. At least one of the receipt heuristics used to select a product profile is preferably configured to account for inaccuracies. In another example the text description of a purchased item in the receipt may be a store specific code. A receipt heuristic can additionally be configured to account for receipt labeling patterns in product fuzzy search.

A product profile is preferably selected through at least one of a set of tiered receipt heuristics. There can be any suitable number of receipt heuristics that may be performed sequentially and or in combination. In one variation a first receipt heuristic is performed and if no product profile is identified for selection a second receipt heuristic is performed. In another variation a first and second receipt heuristic are performed and the product profile is selected based on the combined results of the receipt heuristics. In one preferred embodiment a direct identifier heuristic will initially try to search for a product identifier that corresponds to a product model S and if a product identifier is not found or does not satisfy a match criteria an approximate match heuristic will score a line item against at least one product model of a master product database S as shown in .

Step S which includes searching for a product identifier that corresponds to a product model functions to perform a lookup of at least part of a line item description to match a line item with a product. A product identifier may be a universal product code UPC or a store product code. Additionally a product identifier may be the product description that was previously encountered when selecting a product model. Product models are preferably looked up in a master product database. The master product database is preferably a database of an accumulated and aggregated form of product profile data. The master product database will preferably characterize product profiles with at least one product identifier and may additionally include multiple product identifiers to account for different ways of referring to the product e.g. UPC store specific codes abbreviated descriptions etc. and may additionally store data on line item meta data such as pricing or purchase history. Additionally a receipt processing service may facilitate querying an outside product database with a product identifier to identify a product model. In other words the receipt processing service may perform an automated web scrape for a retailer and product number through any suitable search engine API. Step S is preferably performed initially. If a product identifier is found in the product model to correspond to an identifier of a product profile the corresponding product profile is selected and associated with the line item.

Step S which includes scoring a line item against at least one product model of a master product database functions to perform a fuzzy match for a product model. At least one parameter of a line item is compared to at least one product model of a master product database. The fuzzy search may additionally be performed against web scraped data or outside product databases e.g. a retailer online store . Scoring of a line item is preferably used to identify the best match for a line item and the selected product model for the line item is preferably the product model that satisfies a set of criteria. Typically the selected product model is the product model with the highest score or the score indicating the closest match. In one variation scoring a line item is a secondary receipt heuristic that is performed if the search for a product identifier does not return a product profile. Typically corresponding parameters of a line item and product model are compared. For example when scoring based on product description the product description parameter of the line item is compared to a product description or a product model. Suitable fuzzy matching methods can include for example Lucene n gram detection Levenschtein distance regular expressions or a MYSQL database. Preferably the output of a fuzzy match process can include the type of match UPC Line Price Group Brand as well as a match confidence score the latter of which is adjustable based upon further data processing and acquisition throughout the entire system described herein. An example generated dataset is shown in . Preferably fuzzy matching incorporates receipt specific patterns e.g. retailer specific receipt formats syntax and patterns into the scoring of product models to improve matching performance beyond regular string pairing.

As shown in first receipt specific scoring pattern may include scoring based in part on character sequence order for the text description when comparing a line item to a product model which functions to account for receipt abbreviating product names and descriptions by leaving out some letters and including key letters. For example MILK may be abbreviated as MLK and the character order scoring pattern will preferably score such descriptions as a possible match. Such character order may not indicate a definite match and may depend on additional scoring patterns to correspond. For example if the character order of the line item description matches a product model description and the price is approximately the same then the product is likely the same product. Character sequence matching may additionally account for character set rules such as using an x as a substitute for the character sequence cks . Machine learning may additionally be applied to identify suitable character sequences.

Another receipt specific scoring pattern may include weighting string matching based on sequence order of the description text as shown in . The first word is preferably given more weight than the second word and furthermore the beginning of the first word is given more weight than the end of the first word. Machine learning may be applied to determine scoring weights of first x number of letters matched verses x 1 number of letters matched. Similarly machine learning may be applied to determine scoring weights of first x number of words matched verses x 1 number of words matched. Weighting based on sequence order is preferably used in scoring a comparison based on character matches of the text description of the line item and a text description of a product profile.

Another receipt specific scoring pattern may include weighting character matches based on a character weight rule as shown in . Particular character matches may be better indicators of a match than other characters. Each character may have a static scoring factor as specified in a character weight rule. Alternatively a scoring factor of a character may be dynamically determined such as by being based on merchant other identified products purchased on the receipt possible product model candidates etc. Weighting based on a character set rule is preferably used in scoring a comparison based on character matches of the text description of the line item and a text description of a product profile.

Another receipt specific scoring pattern may include factoring in line item meta data. Line item meta data preferably includes parameters of a line item other than the description product identifier such as price product weight product packaging volume product size product category product quantity product discounts or any suitable supplemental information related to the line item purchase. Use of meta data may be used to filter considered product models and or further refine scores of considered product models. Machine learning may be applied to the meta data to identify a product model or possible product models. For example a product may not have a direct string match to a product description of a product model in the master product database but meta data information showing a matching unit price and an identical packaging volume can be considered to select the product.

Another receipt specific scoring pattern may include factoring in context parameters of the receipt model. Context parameters preferably includes parameters of the purchase outside of the line item such as merchant identifier time of purchase geographic location purchaser name store account ID category identifier purchase total other products purchased and or any suitable parameter providing context of the purchase of the line item. Context parameters can preferably be used to narrow the candidates of product models for selecting one or more specific receipt heuristics to use in selecting a product and or altering the processing in any suitable way. For example if a merchant identifier is identified a merchant specific receipt heuristic may be used in selecting a product profile. The merchant specific receipt heuristic will preferably account for merchant specific receipt patterns. Machine learning may be applied to context parameters to identify product model s .

Another receipt specific scoring pattern may include matching product descriptions while accounting for character set rules. Character set rules may specify sets of characters and character sequences that are treated as equivalent or at least a partial match. For example the characters cks may be abbreviated as an x . Additionally some characters may be considered as wild card charters such as periods or slashes that denote abbreviations. For example the strings Starbucks S bucks and starbux may all be considered equivalent. Similarly some character sequences may be ignored. Such as the character sequences of A N Tx 2QTY and or any suitable character sequences. The character set rules may be dynamically adjusted based on merchant context parameters of the receipt or any suitable condition.

As an additional or alternative receipt heuristic Step S of selecting a product profile to associate with a line item may include retrieving a crowdsourced resolution of a line item S which functions to use user based input on at least a part of the receipt processing. Crowdsourced users may be a selected worker such as a worker using Amazon s Mechanical Turk or the crowdsourced user may be an employee user or any suitable remotely located user. Use of crowdsource resolution in a preferred embodiment is mitigated by using crowdsource resolution in situations where the receipt processing services fails to identify a product profile for a line item as shown in . The task request submitted to the crowdsource user may be a request for transcription of part or all of a receipt for matching a line item to a product profile identifying a merchant from a graphic or any suitable task to facilitate identifying a product profile for a line item. In one variation a user that captures a receipt image e.g. the customer can preferably provide input that can supplement the process of identifying products. A user can take a picture of a product select a product from a list enter the name of the product scan a universal product code answer a survey or perform any supplemental input to facilitate identification of a product profile. The user may provide the information preemptively or reactively e.g. when a line item can not be identified as a product.

Crowdsource resolution is typically engaged when the receipt processing service has low confidence in the machine readable text data. A confidence metric may be obtained directly from the OCR process image processing and or through receipt analysis. As one exemplary confidence analysis the accounting of a receipt may be verified if the line item prices discounts taxes and other fees do not sum to the receipt total then the receipt processing service will typically have low confidence in the machine readable text data. Use of crowdsourced resolution may additionally be dependent on the state of the product master database. In some variations some unidentified line items may be allowed but when identical unidentified line items are processed in multiple receipts then a crowdsourced solution may utilize user input to supplement data. For example a new product may be released for which no information is known so when encountered in a receipt it may not be identified or may even be misidentified . After the new product and the associated line item description is encountered at least once crowdsourced resolution of the new product may be used to obtain a UPC un abbreviated product name or any other information needed to complete the product summary of the new product.

Step S which includes accounting for the selected product profile of the line item functions to augment a data object to indicate the purchase of a product profile associated with the line item. A variety of tasks may be performed to account for the product profile associated with the line item. As one type of accounting task data may be generated and or augmented to reflect information from the receipt. As an alternative accounting task feedback to a user may be transmitted to an application of the user.

Preferably accounting for the selected product profile includes updating a product profile to account for purchase of the line item S as shown in . Updating a product profile may include accounting for purchase history time and count of product purchases identity of purchasers e.g. customer demographics reward card IDs etc. where products are being sold aggregating store product IDs how products are being marked in receipts e.g. adding store specific product codes what products are purchased together pricing of products use of promotions and or any suitable update or new stored data. The new data is preferably stored in the master product database but may alternatively be stored in any suitable database or storage device. Accounting for product profile purchases is preferably performed by a remote server that is accessible and or communicable with a plurality of mobile devices associated with a plurality of users. By accounting for purchase of a line item data for products sold across multiple merchants and locations can be tracked and analyzed vastly improving visibility into purchase behavior of customers. Preferably a product profile can be generated for each product in response to a large number of selected product profiles for each retail experience of each user within the system. As such a preferred product profile can include retail sales data for any selected manufacturer any brand or sub brand of the manufacturer any location time marketing campaign retailer delivery means pricing or any other suitable measure or characteristic of the identified product s . As an example a beverage manufacturer might be interested in a product profile of its brands and or sub brands based on purchase location time of day time of year retailer purchase price coupon rebate or other promotional activity associated with the product and or the manufacturer. A product profile may additionally include receipt information such as description abbreviations store product codes or any suitable information that may be used to facilitate subsequent product profile selection. While a product profile is preferably maintained and or referenced in a master product database a product profile may alternatively be segmented into various data structures stored in any suitable number of databases. The data architecture may have any suitable arrangement. For example purchase records mapping of product names to receipt abbreviations and product meta data may all be stored in separate databases which may be additionally organized or distributed in any suitable data architecture. As each product profile for each user is based upon photographic imagery of the actual purchase of the product the data that populates the product profile is more reliable and accurate than what is currently available to manufacturers retail product marketers and or other business entities.

Additionally or alternatively a method of a preferred embodiment may include providing a receipt processing application programming interface API S and accounting for the selected product profile may include transmitting at least a portion of a selected product profile in response to a receipt processing API request S as shown in . A receipt processing API primarily functions to enable outside parties to benefit from centralized receipt analysis. Various applications and services could leverage the information afforded by the method. As a centralized service more and more receipt data is collected which may be leveraged to improve the receipt processing and product profile identification of the service. In one embodiment the API may return the receipt model with line items supplemented or augmented with product profile information. In another embodiment the API may allow advanced queries such as filtering receipts for a particular product. For example an application may only be concerned if you purchased one particular product at a particular time along with a second particular product the API response can be a true false response based on the receipt processing.

Similarly at least a portion of the selected profile may be transmitted to a manufacturer or any subscribed entity which may function to transfer and monetize the product profile for use by an interested manufacturer. Preferably the method may include providing access to the remote server to a manufacturer or any suitable account holder such that a manufacturer can access manipulate copy retrieve download and or receive a selected product profile. As noted above a preferred product profile can include retail sales data for any selected manufacturer any brand or sub brand of the manufacturer any location time marketing campaign retailer delivery means or any other suitable measure or characteristic of the identified product s . Sharing of the product profile data can preferably be performed by a remote server in communication with one or more user mobile devices and accessible at and or in communication with at least one computer associated with a manufacturer.

Additionally or alternatively Step S may include transmitting feedback to the user S which functions to communicate and or maintain a relationship with the user through the transmission of a reward incentive or information in consideration for the user s providing of the data in Step S. Transmitting feedback is preferably used in combination with other line item accounting as shown in . In particular Step S can include transmitting feedback in the form of an electronic reward or incentive to a mobile device or account of the user such as for example a coupon discount cash back incentive or any other suitable monetary or non monetary form of consideration. Alternatively the feedback can include safety information allergen information recall information product registration with a retailer or manufacturer e.g. for warranty registration loyalty point redemption product activation or other purposes or any other public health safety or welfare information that can and should be distributed to consumers of particular products. As an example purchasers of produce that might be tainted with bacteria can be contacted directly in response to UPC codes retailer product numbers purchase locations purchase dates and the like as opposed to via general announcements or safety bulletins. Additionally or alternatively the feedback can include one or more applicable recipes that use ingredients identified within the receipt image. In another alternative the feedback can include product recommendations based on purchased products. In another alternative the feedback can include one or more trigger surveys directed to the user based on the content of the imaged receipt. An example trigger survey includes offering a coupon or other compensation for answering questions relating to the purchase of an identified product s .

Preferably the feedback can be transmitted from the remote server to the mobile device of the user. Alternatively the feedback can be transmitted directly from a manufacturer e.g. a computer associated with the manufacturer to the mobile device of the user. In another alternative the remote server can function as a clearinghouse for receiving rewards or incentives from the manufacturers for distribution to the mobile device of the user. Any other suitable financial or logistical arrangement of forms of feedback and distribution of the electronic communications can be used.

As shown in an operating environment of a system of the preferred embodiment can include a receipt processing service and a master product database . The receipt processing service is preferably operable in part or in entirety on a mobile device and or a remote server . The system is preferably configured to perform the method as described above. In one preferred embodiment the system is configured for use by a plurality of users applications wherein the system translates and acts on receipt data received from various users.

The receipt processing service no functions to receive organize maintain and update one or more datasets relating to a user s retail experience. More preferably the receipt processing service functions to convert receipt image data to machine readable descriptions of purchased products and then into identified product profiles for line items of the receipt. The receipt processing service no preferably functions in combination with the master product database to identify which products were purchased as indicated in a receipt. The receipt processing service can additionally extract other information such as merchant location time of purchase coupons and sales applied towards purchase user IDs or indicators for a receipt and or any other information portrayed in a receipt. The receipt processing service preferably utilizes receipt specific matching algorithms as described above to identify products when a product cannot be found directly through a product identifier. The receipt processing service may be operable as a processor module in an application of the mobile device on the remote server or divided in operation between the mobile application and the remote server .

The master product database functions to store a repository of product profiles used to store maintain update correct share retrieve and or distribute data associated with a product profile and any associated particular product of interest. The master product database is preferably continually updated through the operation of the system. New product profiles and additional information related to products is preferably added to product profiles automatically. The processing of new receipts can result in the automatic creation of new product profiles and updates to purchase history of products. While the master product database is described as a single database the master product database can be any suitable data architecture employing any suitable number and type of data storage mechanisms. The master product database may be a set of databases linked or unlinked that define product descriptions global purchase history personal purchase history identification history and or any suitable information. A product profile of a preferred embodiment may include parameters and or references to product identity purchase description purchase date purchase amount purchase location purchase method product UPC code product store code brand name sub brand name list of merchants selling the product product purchase records which may include purchase time location user ID other products purchased total purchase count etc. receipt description product metrics product prices product promotions average or mean purchase quantity product purchase and or any suitable parameter of a product. Other product related databases such as mappings between receipt abbreviated words and full text words may additionally be included and incorporated into the use of the master product database .

The mobile device and the remote server are preferably connected through a network . The mobile device of the preferred embodiment can include a display a camera not shown memory storage not shown a communications module and a processor not shown connected to each of the display camera memory storage and or communications module. The mobile device of the preferred embodiment can include any suitable type of mobile computing apparatus such as a smart phone a personal computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a television monitor camera paired with a separate handheld orientation location apparatus or any suitable combination thereof. The mobile device of the preferred embodiment can be connectable either through wired or wireless means to one or more of a satellite positioning system a local area network or wide area network such as a WiFi network and or a cellular communication network generally designated network . In one alternative embodiment the mobile device of the preferred embodiment can include a GPS transceiver although any other type of transceiver for satellite based location services can be employed in lieu of or in addition to a GPS transceiver. The preferred mobile device can function to capture retrieve process store and transmit image data relating to a user s purchase. Preferably the image data is a receipt as described above and the mobile device can be configured with a native application hardware software firmware or any suitable combination thereof to perform one or more functions associated with the method of the preferred embodiment described above.

As shown in a remote server of the preferred embodiment preferably functions to receive raw processed or partially processed data associated with user retail behavior and to categorize manipulate assess process and analyze the user data into a product profile that may be used in a variety of ways including enabling one or more manufacturers to assess their respective marketing efforts providing a receipt processing service and or providing purchase feedback to a user. The remote server can be alternatively configured as one or more standalone modules processors clusters server farms networked computers databases and or cloud based software systems. The preferred remote server can be configured as hardware software firmware or any suitable combination thereof to perform one or more functions associated with the method of the preferred embodiment described above.

As shown in the system of the preferred embodiment can further include a retailer manufacturer external database that is remotely accessible from at least the remote server. As noted above master data for each product can be accumulated according to a tiered process wherein the remote server first attempts to match a UPC code then an item number for the specified retailer then an automated web scrape for a retailer and product number through a search engine API. Accordingly the master product database can preferably access and or scrape external databases such as search engine servers that might contain identifying data concerning one or more products identifiable by their association with one or more of the retailer or manufacturer. As noted above if none of the foregoing processes yield a confirmed match for the purchased product then the remote server can be configured to perform a fuzzy match using UPC database records brand name records previous receipt matching records or processing through a turk type automation. Suitable fuzzy matching methods can include for example Lucene n gram detection Levenschtein distance regular expressions or a MYSQL database which can be locally stored and or maintained at or on the remote server . As noted above the output of a fuzzy match process can include the type of match UPC Line Price Group Brand as well as a match confidence the latter of which is adjustable based upon further data processing and acquisition throughout the entire system described herein. Preferably interaction with the retailer manufacturer external database functions to generate a dataset that can include at least the product identity purchase date purchase amount purchase location purchase method as well as other identifying information such as a UPC code brand name sub brand name and the like.

As shown in the system of the preferred embodiment can further include a retail manager having access to and or in communication with the remote server . Preferably the retail manager is permitted access to the remote server in order to access manipulate copy retrieve download and or receive a selected product profile. As noted above a preferred product profile can include retail sales data for any selected manufacturer any brand or sub brand of the manufacturer any location time marketing campaign retailer delivery means or any other suitable measure or characteristic of the identified product s.

The system and method of the preferred embodiment and variations thereof can be embodied and or implemented at least in part as a machine configured to receive a computer readable medium storing computer readable instructions. The instructions are preferably executed by computer executable components preferably integrated with the components of the above system and or configure for the steps of a method of a preferred embodiment.
