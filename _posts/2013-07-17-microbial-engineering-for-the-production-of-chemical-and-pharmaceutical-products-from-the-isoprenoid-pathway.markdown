This work was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health under Grant Number 1 R01 GM085323 01A1. The government has certain rights in this invention.

Taxol and its structural analogs have been recognized as the most potent and commercially successful anticancer drugs introduced in the last decade.Taxol was first isolated from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree and early stage production methods required sacrificing two to four fully grown trees to supply sufficient dosage for one patient.Taxol s structural complexity necessitated a complex chemical synthesis route requiring 35 51 steps with highest yield of 0.4 .However a semi synthetic route was devised whereby the biosynthetic intermediate baccatin III was first isolated from plant sources and was subsequently converted to Taxol.While this approach and subsequent plant cell culture based production efforts have decreased the need for harvesting the yew tree production still depends on plant based processeswith accompanying limitations of productivity and scalability and constraints on the number of Taxol derivatives that can be synthesized in search for more efficacious drugs.

Recent developments in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology offer new possibilities for the overproduction of complex natural products through more technically amenable microbial hosts.Although exciting progress has been made in the elucidation of the biosynthetic mechanism of Taxol in commercially relevant Taxol producing strains have eluded prior attempts aiming at the transfer of this complex biosynthetic machinery into a microbial host.Yet as with other natural products microbial production through metabolically engineered strains offers attractive economics and great potential for synthesizing a diverse array of new compounds with anti cancer and other pharmaceutical activity.

The metabolic pathway for Taxol and its analogs consists of an upstream isoprenoid pathway that is native to and a heterologous downstream terpenoid pathway . The upstream mevalonic acid MVA or methylerythritol phosphate MEP pathways can produce the two common building blocks isopentenyl pyrophosphate IPP and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate DMAPP from which Taxol and other isoprenoid compounds are formed.Recent studies have highlighted the engineering of the above upstream pathways to support biosynthesis of heterologous isoprenoids such as lycopene and artemisinic acid.The downstream taxadiene pathway has been reconstructed in but to date titers have not exceeded 1.3 mg L.

The above rational metabolic engineering approaches focused on either the upstream MVA or MEP or the downstream terpenoid pathway implicitly assuming that modifications are additive i.e. a linear behavior.While this approach can yield moderate increases in flux it generally ignores non specific effects such as toxicity of intermediate metabolites cellular effects of the vectors used for expression and hidden unknown pathways that may compete with the main pathway and divert flux away from the desired target. Combinatorial approaches can avoid such problems as they offer the opportunity to adequately sample the parameter space and elucidate these complex non linear interactions.However they require a high throughput screen which is often not available for many desirable natural products.Yet another class of pathway optimization methods has explored the combinatorial space of different sources of the heterologous genes comprising the pathway of interest.Still dependent on a high throughput assay these methods generally ignore the need for determining an optimal level of expression for the individual pathway genes and as such have proven less effective in structuring an optimal pathway.

In the present work as an example of aspects of the invention we focus on the optimal balancing between the upstream IPP forming pathway with the downstream terpenoid pathway of taxadiene synthesis. This is achieved by grouping the nine enzyme pathway into two modules a four gene upstream native MEP pathway module and a two gene downstream heterologous pathway to taxadiene . Using this basic configuration parameters such as the effect of plasmid copy number on cell physiology gene order and promoter strength in an expression cassette and chromosomal integration are evaluated with respect to their effect on taxadiene production. This modular and multivariable combinatorial approach allows us to efficiently sample the main parameters affecting pathway flux without the need for a high throughput screen. The multivariate search across multiple promoters and copy numbers for each pathway module reveals a highly non linear taxadiene flux landscape with a global maximum exhibiting a 15 000 fold increase in taxadiene production over the control yielding 300 mg L production of taxadiene in small scale fermentations. Further we have engineered the P450 based oxidation chemistry in Taxol biosynthesis in with our engineered strains improving the taxadien 5 ol production 2400 fold over the state of the art. These improvements unlock the potential for the large scale production of thousands of valuable terpenoids by well established microbial systems.

Taxol is a potent anticancer drug first isolated as a natural product from the Pacific yew tree. However reliable and cost efficient production of Taxol or Taxol analogs by traditional production routes from plant extracts is limited. Here we report a multivariate modular approach to metabolic pathway engineering to amplify by 15000 fold the production of taxadiene in an engineered . Taxadiene the first committed Taxol intermediate is the biosynthetic product of the non mevalonate pathway in comprising two modules the native upstream pathway forming Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate IPP and a heterologous downstream terpenoid forming pathway. Systematic multivariate search identified conditions that optimally balance the two pathway modules to minimize accumulation of inhibitory intermediates and flux diversion to side products. We also engineered the next step after taxadiene in Taxol biosynthesis a P450 based oxidation step that yielded 98 substrate conversion and present the first example of in vivo production of any functionalized Taxol intermediates in . The modular pathway engineering approach not only highlights the complexity of multi step pathways but also allowed accumulation of high taxadiene and taxadien 5 ol titers 300 mg L and 60 mg L respectively in small scale fermentations thus exemplifying the potential of microbial production of Taxol and its derivatives.

This invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of including comprising or having containing involving and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.

Microbial production of terpenoids such as taxadiene is demonstrated herein. When expressed at satisfactory levels microbial routes reduce dramatically the cost of production of such compounds. Additionally they utilize cheap abundant and renewable feedstocks such as sugars and other carbohydrates and can be the source for the synthesis of numerous derivatives that may exhibit far superior properties than the original compound. A key element in the cost competitive production of compounds of the isoprenoid pathway using a microbial route is the amplification of this pathway in order to allow the overproduction of these molecules. Described herein are methods that enhance or amplify the flux towards terpenoid production in . Specifically methods are provided to amplify the metabolic flux to the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate IPP a key intermediate for the production of isoprenoid compounds dimethylallyl pyrophosphate DMAPP geranyl diphosphate GPP farnesyl diphosphate FPP geranylgeranyl diphosphate GGPP and farnesyl geranyl diphosphate FGPP paclitaxel Taxol ginkolides geraniol farnesol geranylgeraniol linalool isoprene monoterpenoids such as menthol carotenoids such as lycopene polyisoprenoids such as polyisoprene or natural rubber diterpenoids such as eleutherobin and sesquiterpenoids such as artemisinin.

Aspects of the invention relate to the production of terpenoids. As used herein a terpenoid also referred to as an isoprenoid is an organic chemical derived from a five carbon isoprene unit. Several non limiting examples of terpenoids classified based on the number of isoprene units that they contain include hemiterpenoids 1 isoprene unit monoterpenoids 2 isoprene units sesquiterpenoids 3 isoprene units diterpenoids 4 isoprene units sesterterpenoids 5 isoprene units triterpenoids 6 isoprene units tetraterpenoids 8 isoprene units and polyterpenoids with a larger number of isoprene units. In some embodiments the terpenoid that is produced is taxadiene. In some embodiments the terpenoid that is produced is Citronellol Cubebol Nootkatone Cineol Limonene Eleutherobin Sarcodictyin Pseudopterosins Ginkgolides Stevioside Rebaudioside A sclareol labdenediol levopimaradiene sandracopimaradiene or isopemaradiene.

Described herein are methods and compositions for optimizing production of terpenoids in cells by controlling expression of genes or proteins participating in an upstream pathway and a downstream pathway. The upstream pathway involves production of isopentyl pyrophosphate IPP and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate DMAPP which can be achieved by two different metabolic pathways the mevalonic acid MVA pathway and the MEP 2 C methyl D erythritol 4 phosphate pathway also called the MEP DOXP 2 C methyl D erythritol 4 phosphate 1 deoxy D xylulose 5 phosphate pathway the non mevalonate pathway or the mevalonic acid independent pathway.

The downstream pathway is a synthetic pathway that leads to production of a terpenoids and involves recombinant gene expression of a terpenoid synthase also referred to as terpene cyclase enzyme and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase GGPPS enzyme. In some embodiments a terpenoid synthase enzyme is a diterpenoid synthase enzyme. Several non limiting examples of diterpenoid synthase enzymes include casbene synthase taxadiene synthase levopimaradiene synthase abietadiene synthase isopimaradiene synthase ent copalyl diphosphate synthase syn stemar 13 ene synthase syn stemod 13 17 ene synthase syn pimara 7 15 diene synthase ent sandaracopimaradiene synthase ent cassa 12 15 diene synthase ent pimara 8 14 15 diene synthase ent kaur 15 ene synthase ent kaur 16 ene synthase aphidicolan 16 ol synthase phyllocladan 16 ol synthase fusicocca 2 10 14 diene synthase and terpentetriene cyclase.

Surprisingly as demonstrated in the Examples section optimization of terpenoid synthesis by manipulation of the upstream and downstream pathways described herein was not a simple linear or additive process. Rather through complex combinatorial analysis optimization was achieved through balancing components of the upstream and downstream pathways. Unexpectedly as demonstrated in taxadiene accumulation exhibited a strong non linear dependence on the relative strengths of the upstream MEP and downstream synthetic taxadiene pathways.

Aspects of the invention relate to controlling the expression of genes and proteins in the MEP pathway for optimized production of a terpenoid such as taxadiene. Optimized production of a terpenoid refers to producing a higher amount of a terpenoid following pursuit of an optimization strategy than would be achieved in the absence of such a strategy. It should be appreciated that any gene and or protein within the MEP pathway is encompassed by methods and compositions described herein. In some embodiments a gene within the MEP pathway is one of the following dxs ispC ispD ispE ispF ispG ispH idi ispA or ispB. Expression of one or more genes and or proteins within the MEP pathway can be upregulated and or downregulated. In certain embodiments upregulation of one or more genes and or proteins within the MEP pathway can be combined with downregulation of one or more genes and or proteins within the MEP pathway.

It should be appreciated that genes and or proteins can be regulated alone or in combination. For example the expression of dxs can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of ispC ispD ispE ispF ispG ispH idi ispA and ispB. The expression of ispC can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispD ispE ispF ispG ispH idi ispA and ispB. The expression of ispD can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispE ispF ispG ispH idi ispA and ispB. The expression of ispE can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispF ispG ispH idi ispA and ispB. The expression of ispF can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispE ispG ispH idi ispA and ispB. The expression of ispG can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispE ispF ispH idi ispA and ispB. The expression of ispH can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispE ispF ispG idi ispA and ispB. The expression of idi can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispE ispF ispG ispH ispA and ispB. The expression of ispA can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispE ispF ispG ispH idi and ispB. The expression of ispB can be upregulated or downregulated alone or in combination with upregulation or downregulation of expression of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispE ispF ispG ispH idi and ispA. In some embodiments expression of the gene and or protein of one or more of dxs ispC ispD ispE ispF ispG ispH and idi is upregulated while expression of the gene and or protein of ispA and or ispB is down regulated.

Expression of genes within the MEP pathway can be regulated in a modular method. As used herein regulation by a modular method refers to regulation of multiple genes together. For example in some embodiments multiple genes within the MEP pathway are recombinantly expressed on a contiguous region of DNA such as an operon. It should be appreciated that a cell that expresses such a module can also express one or more other genes within the MEP pathway either recombinantly or endogenously.

A non limiting example of a module of genes within the MEP pathway is a module containing the genes dxs idi ispD and ispF as presented in the Examples section and referred to herein as dxs idi ispDF. It should be appreciated that modules of genes within the MEP pathway consistent with aspects of the invention can contain any of the genes within the MEP pathway in any order.

Expression of genes and proteins within the downstream synthetic terpenoid synthesis pathway can also be regulated in order to optimize terpenoid production. The synthetic downstream terpenoid synthesis pathway involves recombinant expression of a terpenoid synthase enzyme and a GGPPS enzyme. Any terpenoid synthase enzyme as discussed above can be expressed with GGPPS depending on the downstream product to be produced. For example taxadiene synthase is used for the production of taxadiene. Recombinant expression of the taxadiene synthase enzyme and the GGPPS enzyme can be regulated independently or together. In some embodiments the two enzymes are regulated together in a modular fashion. For example the two enzymes can be expressed in an operon in either order GGPPS TS referred to as GT or TS GGPPS referred to as TG .

Manipulation of the expression of genes and or proteins including modules such as the dxs idi ispDF operon and the TS GGPPS operon can be achieved through methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example expression of the genes or operons can be regulated through selection of promoters such as inducible promoters with different strengths. Several non limiting examples of promoters include Trc T5 and T7. Additionally expression of genes or operons can be regulated through manipulation of the copy number of the gene or operon in the cell. For example in certain embodiments a strain containing an additional copy of the dxs idi ispDF operon on its chromosome under Trc promoter control produces an increased amount of taxadiene relative to one overexpressing only the synthetic downstream pathway. In some embodiments expression of genes or operons can be regulated through manipulating the order of the genes within a module. For example in certain embodiments changing the order of the genes in a downstream synthetic operon from GT to TG results in a 2 3 fold increase in taxadiene production. In some embodiments expression of genes or operons is regulated through integration of one or more genes or operons into a chromosome. For example in certain embodiments integration of the upstream dxs idi ispDF operon into the chromosome of a cell results in increased taxadiene production.

It should be appreciated that the genes associated with the invention can be obtained from a variety of sources. In some embodiments the genes within the MEP pathway are bacterial genes such as genes. In some embodiments the gene encoding for GGPPS is a plant gene. For example the gene encoding for GGPPS can be from a species of such as . In some embodiments the gene encoding for taxadiene synthase is a plant gene. For example the gene encoding for taxadiene synthase can be from a species of such as . Representative GenBank Accession numbers for GGPPS and taxadiene synthase are provided by AF081514 and U48796 the sequences of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

As one of ordinary skill in the art would be aware homologous genes for use in methods associated with the invention can be obtained from other species and can be identified by homology searches for example through a protein BLAST search available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI internet site www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Genes and or operons associated with the invention can be cloned for example by PCR amplification and or restriction digestion from DNA from any source of DNA which contains the given gene. In some embodiments a gene and or operon associated with the invention is synthetic. Any means of obtaining a gene and or operon associated with the invention is compatible with the instant invention.

In some embodiments further optimization of terpenoid production is achieved by modifying a gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell. In some embodiments the GGPPS enzyme has one or more of the follow mutations A162V G140C L182M F218Y D160G C184S K367R A151T M185I D264Y E368D C184R L331I G262V R365S A114D S239C G295D 1276V K343N P183S I172T D267G I149V T234I E153D and T259A. In some embodiments the GGPPS enzyme has a mutation in residue S239 and or residue G295. In certain embodiments the GGPPS enzyme has the mutation S239C and or G295D.

In some embodiments modification of a gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell involves codon optimization for expression in a bacterial cell. Codon usages for a variety of organisms can be accessed in the Codon Usage Database www.kazusa.or.jp codon . Codon optimization including identification of optimal codons for a variety of organisms and methods for achieving codon optimization are familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art and can be achieved using standard methods.

In some embodiments modifying a gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell involves making one or more mutations in the gene before it is recombinantly expressed in a cell. For example a mutation can involve a substitution or deletion of a single nucleotide or multiple nucleotides. In some embodiments a mutation of one or more nucleotides in a gene will result in a mutation in the protein produced from the gene such as a substitution or deletion of one or more amino acids.

In some embodiments it may be advantageous to use a cell that has been optimized for production of a terpenoid. For example in some embodiments a cell that overexpresses one or more components of the non mevalonate MEP pathway is used at least in part to amplify isopentyl diphosphate IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate DMAPP substrates of GGPPS. In some embodiments overexpression of one or more components of the non mevalonate MEP pathway is achieved by increasing the copy number of one or more components of the non mevalonate MEP pathway. For example copy numbers of components at rate limiting steps in the MEP pathway such as dxs ispD ispF idi can be amplified such as by additional episomal expression.

In some embodiments rational design is involved in constructing specific mutations in proteins such as enzymes. As used herein rational design refers to incorporating knowledge of the enzyme or related enzymes such as its three dimensional structure its active site s its substrate s and or the interaction between the enzyme and substrate into the design of the specific mutation. Based on a rational design approach mutations can be created in an enzyme which can then be screened for increased production of a terpenoid relative to control levels. In some embodiments mutations can be rationally designed based on homology modeling. As used herein homology modeling refers to the process of constructing an atomic resolution model of one protein from its amino acid sequence and a three dimensional structure of a related homologous protein.

In some embodiments random mutations can be made in a gene such as a gene encoding for an enzyme and these mutations can be screened for increased production of a terpenoid relative to control levels. For example screening for mutations in components of the MEP pathway or components of other pathways that lead to enhanced production of a terpenoid may be conducted through a random mutagenesis screen or through screening of known mutations. In some embodiments shotgun cloning of genomic fragments could be used to identify genomic regions that lead to an increase in production of a terpenoid through screening cells or organisms that have these fragments for increased production of a terpenoid. In some cases one or more mutations may be combined in the same cell or organism.

In some embodiments production of a terpenoid in a cell can be increased through manipulation of enzymes that act in the same pathway as the enzymes associated with the invention. For example in some embodiments it may be advantageous to increase expression of an enzyme or other factor that acts upstream of a target enzyme such as an enzyme associated with the invention. This could be achieved by over expressing the upstream factor using any standard method.

Optimization of protein expression can also be achieved through selection of appropriate promoters and ribosome binding sites. In some embodiments this may include the selection of high copy number plasmids or low or medium copy number plasmids. The step of transcription termination can also be targeted for regulation of gene expression through the introduction or elimination of structures such as stem loops.

Aspects of the invention relate to expression of recombinant genes in cells. The invention encompasses any type of cell that recombinantly expresses genes associated with the invention including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In some embodiments the cell is a bacterial cell such as spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. and spp. The bacterial cell can be a Gram negative cell such as an cell or a Gram positive cell such as a species of .

Preferably the yeast strain is a strain or a spp. strain. Other examples of fungi include spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. spp. and spp. In other embodiments the cell is an algal cell or a plant cell. It should be appreciated that some cells compatible with the invention may express an endogenous copy of one or more of the genes associated with the invention as well as a recombinant copy. In some embodiments if a cell has an endogenous copy of one or more of the genes associated with the invention then the methods will not necessarily require adding a recombinant copy of the gene s that are endogenously expressed. In some embodiments the cell may endogenously express one or more enzymes from the pathways described herein and may recombinantly express one or more other enzymes from the pathways described herein for efficient production of a terpenoid.

Further aspects of the invention relate to screening for bacterial cells or strains that exhibit optimized terpenoid production. As described above methods associated with the invention involve generating cells that overexpress one or more genes in the MEP pathway. Terpenoid production from culturing of such cells can be measured and compared to a control cell wherein a cell that exhibits a higher amount of a terpenoid production relative to a control cell is selected as a first improved cell. The cell can be further modified by recombinant expression of a terpenoid synthase enzyme and a GGPPS enzyme. The level of expression of one or more of the components of the non mevalonate MEP pathway the terpenoid synthase enzyme and or the GGPPS enzyme in the cell can then be manipulated and terpenoid production can be measured again leading to selection of a second improved cell that produces greater amounts of a terpenoid than the first improved cell. In some embodiments the terpenoid synthase enzyme is a taxadiene synthase enzyme.

Further aspects of the invention relate to the identification and characterization via GC MS of a previously unknown metabolite in bacterial cells . The level of accumulation of the newly identified metabolite indole can be controlled by genetically manipulating the microbial pathway by the overexpression down regulation or mutation of the isoprenoid pathway genes. The metabolite indole anti correlates as a direct variable to the taxadiene production in engineered strains . Further controlling the accumulation of indole for improving the flux towards terpenoid biosynthesis in bacterial systems specifically in cells such as cells or other cells can be achieved by balancing the upstream non mevalonate isoprenoid pathway with the downstream product synthesis pathways or by modifications to or regulation of the indole pathway. In so doing the skilled person can reduce or control the accumulation of indole and thereby reduce the inhibitory effect of indole on the production of taxadiene and other terpenoids derived from the described pathways such as monoterpenoids sesquiterpenoids including amorphadiene diterpenoids including levopimaradiene triterpenes and tetraterpenes. Other methods for reducing or controlling the accumulation of indole include removing the accumulated indole from the fermentation through chemical methods such as by using absorbents scavengers etc.

In other embodiments methods are provided that include measuring the amount or concentration of indole in a cell that produces one or more terpenoids or in a culture of the cells that produce one or more terpenoids. The amount or concentration of indole can be measured once or two or more times as suitable using methods known in the art and as described herein. Such methods can be used to guide processes of producing one or more terpenoids e.g. in process improvement. Such methods can be used to guide strain construction e.g. for strain improvement.

The identification of the means to achieve this balancing yielded a 15000 fold improvement in the overproduction of terpenoids such as taxadiene compared to wild type bacterial cells expressed with a heterologous taxadiene biosynthetic pathway. The production was further increased through modified fermentation methods that yielded concentrations of approximately 2 g L which is 1500 fold higher compared to any prior reported taxadiene production. As demonstrated herein by genetically engineering the non mevalonate isoprenoid pathway in the accumulation of this metabolite can now be controlled which regulates the flux towards the isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacterial cells. Also demonstrated herein is further channeling of the taxadiene production into the next key precursor to Taxol taxadien 5 ol achieved through engineering the oxidation chemistry for Taxol biosynthesis. Example 5 presents the first successful extension of the synthetic pathway from taxadiene to taxadien 5 ol. Similar to the majority of other terpenoids the Taxol biosynthesis follows the unified fashion of two phase biosynthetic process i the cyclase phase of linear coupling of the prenyl precursors IPP and DMAPP to GGPP followed by the molecular cyclization and rearrangement for the committed precursor taxadiene VIII IX .After the committed precursor ii the oxidation phase the cyclic olefin taxadiene core structure is then functionalized by seven cytochrome P450 oxygenases together with its redox partners decorated with two acetate groups and a benzoate group by acyl and aroyl CoA dependent transferases keto group by keto oxidase and epoxide group by epoxidase lead to the late intermediate baccatin III to which the C13 side chain is attached for Taxol X XIII .Although a rough sequential order of the early oxidation phase reactions are predicted the precise timing order of some of the hydroxylations acylations and benzoylation reactions are uncertain. However it is clear that the early bifurcation starts from the cytochrome p450 mediated hydroxylation of taxadiene core at C5 position followed the downstream hydroxylations using a homologous family of cytochrome p450 enzymes with high deduced similarity to each other 70 but with limited resemblance 

Further aspects of the invention relate to chimeric P450 enzymes. Functional expression of plant cytochrome P450 has been considered challenging due to the inherent limitations of bacterial platforms such as the absence of electron transfer machinery cytochrome P450 reductases and translational incompatibility of the membrane signal modules of P450 enzymes due to the lack of an endoplasmic reticulum.

In some embodiments the taxadiene 5 hydroxylase associated with methods of the invention is optimized through N terminal transmembrane engineering and or the generation of chimeric enzymes through translational fusion with a CPR redox partner. In some embodiments the CPR redox partner is a cytochrome P450 reductase TCPR . In certain embodiments cytochrome P450 taxadiene 5 hydroxylase T5 OH is obtained from GenBank Accession number AY289209 the sequence of which is incorporated by reference herein . In some embodiments NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase TCPR is obtained from GenBank Accession number AY571340 the sequence of which is incorporated by reference herein .

The taxadiene 5 hydroxylase and TCPR can be joined by a linker such as GSTGS SEQ ID NO 50 . In some embodiments taxadiene 5 hydroxylase and or TCPR are truncated to remove all or part of the transmembrane region of one or both proteins. For example taxadiene 5 hydroxylase in some embodiments is truncated to remove 8 24 or 42 N terminal amino acids. In some embodiments the N terminal 74 amino acids of TCPR are truncated. An additional peptide can also be fused to taxadiene 5 hydroxylase. For example one or more amino acids from bovine 17 hydroxylase can be added to taxadiene 5 hydroxylase. In certain embodiments the peptide MALLLAVF SEQ ID NO 51 is added to taxadiene 5 hydroxylase. A non limiting example of polypeptide comprising taxadiene 5 hydroxylase fused to TCPR is At24T5 OH tTCPR.

In some embodiments the chimeric enzyme is able to carry out the first oxidation step with more than 10 taxadiene conversion to taxadiene 5 ol and the byproduct 5 12 Oxa 3 11 cyclotaxane. For example the percent taxadiene conversion to taxadiene 5 ol and the byproduct 5 12 Oxa 3 11 cyclotaxane can be at least 20 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 95 at least 98 approximately 99 or approximately 100 .

In certain embodiments the chimeric enzyme is At245 OH tTCPR which was found to be capable of carrying out the first oxidation step with more than 98 taxadiene conversion to taxadiene 5 ol and the byproduct 5 12 Oxa 3 11 cyclotaxane OCT . Engineering of the step of taxadiene 5 ol production is critical in the production of Taxol and was found to be limiting in previous efforts to construct this pathway in yeast. The engineered construct developed herein demonstrated greater than 98 conversion of taxadiene in vivo with a 2400 fold improvement over previous heterologous expression in yeast. Thus in addition to synthesizing significantly greater amounts of key Taxol intermediates this study also provides the basis for the synthesis of subsequent metabolites in the pathway by similar P450 chemistry.

As used herein the terms protein and polypeptide are used interchangeably and thus the term polypeptide may be used to refer to a full length polypeptide and may also be used to refer to a fragment of a full length polypeptide. As used herein with respect to polypeptides proteins or fragments thereof isolated means separated from its native environment and present in sufficient quantity to permit its identification or use. Isolated when referring to a protein or polypeptide means for example i selectively produced by expression cloning or ii purified as by chromatography or electrophoresis. Isolated proteins or polypeptides may be but need not be substantially pure. The term substantially pure means that the proteins or polypeptides are essentially free of other substances with which they may be found in production nature or in vivo systems to an extent practical and appropriate for their intended use. Substantially pure polypeptides may be obtained naturally or produced using methods described herein and may be purified with techniques well known in the art. Because an isolated protein may be admixed with other components in a preparation the protein may comprise only a small percentage by weight of the preparation. The protein is nonetheless isolated in that it has been separated from the substances with which it may be associated in living systems i.e. isolated from other proteins.

The invention also encompasses nucleic acids that encode for any of the polypeptides described herein libraries that contain any of the nucleic acids and or polypeptides described herein and compositions that contain any of the nucleic acids and or polypeptides described herein.

In some embodiments one or more of the genes associated with the invention is expressed in a recombinant expression vector. As used herein a vector may be any of a number of nucleic acids into which a desired sequence or sequences may be inserted by restriction and ligation for transport between different genetic environments or for expression in a host cell. Vectors are typically composed of DNA although RNA vectors are also available. Vectors include but are not limited to plasmids fosmids phagemids virus genomes and artificial chromosomes.

A cloning vector is one which is able to replicate autonomously or integrated in the genome in a host cell and which is further characterized by one or more endonuclease restriction sites at which the vector may be cut in a determinable fashion and into which a desired DNA sequence may be ligated such that the new recombinant vector retains its ability to replicate in the host cell. In the case of plasmids replication of the desired sequence may occur many times as the plasmid increases in copy number within the host cell such as a host bacterium or just a single time per host before the host reproduces by mitosis. In the case of phage replication may occur actively during a lytic phase or passively during a lysogenic phase.

An expression vector is one into which a desired DNA sequence may be inserted by restriction and ligation such that it is operably joined to regulatory sequences and may be expressed as an RNA transcript. Vectors may further contain one or more marker sequences suitable for use in the identification of cells which have or have not been transformed or transfected with the vector. Markers include for example genes encoding proteins which increase or decrease either resistance or sensitivity to antibiotics or other compounds genes which encode enzymes whose activities are detectable by standard assays known in the art e.g. galactosidase luciferase or alkaline phosphatase and genes which visibly affect the phenotype of transformed or transfected cells hosts colonies or plaques e.g. green fluorescent protein . Preferred vectors are those capable of autonomous replication and expression of the structural gene products present in the DNA segments to which they are operably joined.

As used herein a coding sequence and regulatory sequences are said to be operably joined when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequences. If it is desired that the coding sequences be translated into a functional protein two DNA sequences are said to be operably joined if induction of a promoter in the 5 regulatory sequences results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not 1 result in the introduction of a frame shift mutation 2 interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequences or 3 interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus a promoter region would be operably joined to a coding sequence if the promoter region were capable of effecting transcription of that DNA sequence such that the resulting transcript can be translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.

When the nucleic acid molecule that encodes any of the enzymes of the claimed invention is expressed in a cell a variety of transcription control sequences e.g. promoter enhancer sequences can be used to direct its expression. The promoter can be a native promoter i.e. the promoter of the gene in its endogenous context which provides normal regulation of expression of the gene. In some embodiments the promoter can be constitutive i.e. the promoter is unregulated allowing for continual transcription of its associated gene. A variety of conditional promoters also can be used such as promoters controlled by the presence or absence of a molecule.

The precise nature of the regulatory sequences needed for gene expression may vary between species or cell types but shall in general include as necessary 5 non transcribed and 5 non translated sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation respectively such as a TATA box capping sequence CAAT sequence and the like. In particular such 5 non transcribed regulatory sequences will include a promoter region which includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined gene. Regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences or upstream activator sequences as desired. The vectors of the invention may optionally include 5 leader or signal sequences. The choice and design of an appropriate vector is within the ability and discretion of one of ordinary skill in the art.

Expression vectors containing all the necessary elements for expression are commercially available and known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Sambrook et al. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989. Cells are genetically engineered by the introduction into the cells of heterologous DNA RNA . That heterologous DNA RNA is placed under operable control of transcriptional elements to permit the expression of the heterologous DNA in the host cell. Heterologous expression of genes associated with the invention for production of a terpenoid such as taxadiene is demonstrated in the Examples section using . The novel method for producing terpenoids can also be expressed in other bacterial cells fungi including yeast cells plant cells etc.

A nucleic acid molecule that encodes an enzyme associated with the invention can be introduced into a cell or cells using methods and techniques that are standard in the art. For example nucleic acid molecules can be introduced by standard protocols such as transformation including chemical transformation and electroporation transduction particle bombardment etc. Expressing the nucleic acid molecule encoding the enzymes of the claimed invention also may be accomplished by integrating the nucleic acid molecule into the genome.

In some embodiments one or more genes associated with the invention is expressed recombinantly in a bacterial cell. Bacterial cells according to the invention can be cultured in media of any type rich or minimal and any composition. As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art routine optimization would allow for use of a variety of types of media. The selected medium can be supplemented with various additional components. Some non limiting examples of supplemental components include glucose antibiotics IPTG for gene induction ATCC Trace Mineral Supplement and glycolate. Similarly other aspects of the medium and growth conditions of the cells of the invention may be optimized through routine experimentation. For example pH and temperature are non limiting examples of factors which can be optimized. In some embodiments factors such as choice of media media supplements and temperature can influence production levels of terpenoids such as taxadiene. In some embodiments the concentration and amount of a supplemental component may be optimized. In some embodiments how often the media is supplemented with one or more supplemental components and the amount of time that the media is cultured before harvesting a terpenoid such as taxadiene is optimized.

According to aspects of the invention high titers of a terpenoid such as taxadiene are produced through the recombinant expression of genes associated with the invention in a cell. As used herein high titer refers to a titer in the milligrams per liter mg L scale. The titer produced for a given product will be influenced by multiple factors including choice of media. In some embodiments the total taxadiene titer is at least 1 mg L. In some embodiments the total taxadiene titer is at least 10 mg L. In some embodiments the total taxadiene titer is at least 250 mg L. For example the total taxadiene titer can be at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 525 550 575 600 625 650 675 700 725 750 775 800 825 850 875 900 or more than 900 mg Lincluding any intermediate values. In some embodiments the total taxadiene titer can be at least 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 or more than 5.0 g Lincluding any intermediate values.

In some embodiments the total taxadiene 5 ol titer is at least 50 mg L. For example the total taxadiene 5 ol titer can be at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 or more than 70 mg Lincluding any intermediate values.

The liquid cultures used to grow cells associated with the invention can be housed in any of the culture vessels known and used in the art. In some embodiments large scale production in an aerated reaction vessel such as a stirred tank reactor can be used to produce large quantities of terpenoids such as taxadiene that can be recovered from the cell culture. In some embodiments the terpenoid is recovered from the gas phase of the cell culture for example by adding an organic layer such as dodecane to the cell culture and recovering the terpenoid from the organic layer.

Terpenoids such as taxadiene produced through methods described herein have widespread applications including pharmaceuticals such as paclitaxel Taxol artemisinin ginkolides eleutherobin and pseudopterosins and many other potential pharmaceutical compounds. Further applications include compounds used in flavors and cosmetics such as geraniol farnesol geranlygeraniol linalool limonene pinene cineol and isoprene. Further applications include compounds for use as biofuels such as alcohols of 5 10 and 15 carbon atom length. It is noted that the above compounds are presently produced as extracts of various plants. Plant extract based methods are tedious yield very small amounts and are limited as to the actual molecules that can be so obtained namely they do not allow the easy production of derivatives that may possess far superior properties than the original compounds.

Single transformants of pre engineered strains harboring the appropriate plasmid with upstream MEP downstream taxadiene pathway and taxadiene 5 ol were cultivated for 18 h at 30 C. in Luria Bertani LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics 100 mg mL carbenecilin 34 mg mL chloramphenicol 25 mg L kanamycin or 50 mg L spectinomycin . For small scale cultures to screen the engineered strains these preinnoculum were used to seed fresh 2 mL rich media 5 g L yeast extract 10 g L Trypton 15 g L glucose 10 g L NaCl 100 mM HEPS 3 mL L Antifoam B pH 7.6 100 ug mL Carbenicillin and 34 ug mL chloramphenicol at a starting Aof 0.1. The culture was maintained with appropriate antibiotics and 100 mM IPTG for gene induction at 22 C. for 5 days.

The 3 L Bioflo bioreactor New Brunswick was assembled as to manufacturer s instructions. One liter of rich media with 1 glycerol v v was inoculated with 50 mL of 8 h culture Aof 2.2 of the strain 26 At24T5 OH tTCPR grown in LB medium containing the antibiotics 100 mg mL carbenicillin 34 mg mL chloramphenicol at the same concentrations. 1 L bioreactors with biphasic liquid liquid fermentation using 20 v v dodecane. Oxygen was supplied as filtered air at 0.5 v v m and agitation was adjusted to maintain dissolved oxygen levels above 50 . pH of the culture was controlled at 7.0 using 10 NaOH. The temperature of the culture in the fermentor was controlled at 30 C. until the cells were grown into an optical density of approximately 0.8 as measured at a wavelength of 600 nm OD600 . The temperature of the fermentor was reduced to 22 C. and the cells were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG. Dodecane was added aseptically to 20 v v of the media volume. During the course of the fermentation the concentration of glycerol and acetate accumulation was monitored with constant time intervals. During the fermentation as the glycerol concentration depleted below 0.5 g L glycerol 3 g L was introduced into the bioreactor.

The same medium composition was used for the fermentation of strains 17 and 26 with appropriate antibiotics strain 17 100 g mL carbenicillin and 50 g mL spectinomycin strain 26 50 g mL spectinomycin .

For the taxadien 5 ol producing strain one liter of complex medium with 1 glycerol v v was inoculated with 50 mL of an 8 h culture OD of 2.2 of strain 26 At24T5 OH tTCPR grown in LB medium containing 50 g mL spectinomycin and 34 g mL chloramphenicol . Oxygen was supplied as filtered air at 0.5 vvm and agitation was adjusted to maintain dissolved oxygen levels above 30 . The pH of the culture was controlled at 7.0 using 10 NaOH. The temperature of the culture in the fermentor was controlled at 30 C. until the cells were grown into an optical density of approximately 0.8 as measured at a wavelength of 600 nm OD600 . The temperature of the fermentor was reduced to 22 C. and the pathway was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG. Dodecane was added aseptically to 20 v v of the media volume. During the course of the fermentation the concentration of glycerol and acetate accumulation was monitored with constant time intervals. During the fermentation as the glycerol concentration depleted 0.5 1 g L 3 g L of glycerol was introduced into the bioreactor.

For analysis of taxadiene accumulation from small scale culture 1.5 mL of the culture was vortexed with 1 mL hexane for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged to separate the organic layer. For bioreactor 1 uL of the dodecane layer was diluted to 200 uL using hexane. 1 uL of the hexane layer was analyzed by GC MS Varian saturn 3800 GC attached to a Varian 2000 MS . The sample was injected into a HP5ms column 30 m 250 uM 0.25 uM thickness Agilent Technologies USA . Helium ultra purity at a flow rate 1.0 ml min was used as a carrier gas. The oven temperature was first kept constant at 50 C. for 1 min and then increased to 220 C. at the increment of 10 C. min and finally held at this temperature for 10 min. The injector and transfer line temperatures were set at 200 C. and 250 C. respectively.

Standard compounds from biological or synthetic sources for taxadiene and taxadiene 5 ol was not commercially available. Thus we performed fermentations of taxadiene producing in a 2 L bioreactor to extract pure material. Taxadiene was extracted by solvent extraction using hexane followed by multiple rounds of silica column chromatography to obtain the pure material for constructing a standard curve for GC MS analysis. We have compared the GC and MS profile of the pure taxadiene with the reported literature to confirm the authenticity of the compound. In order to check the purity we have performed HNMR of taxadiene. Since the accumulation of taxadiene 5 ol was very low level we used taxadiene as a measure to quantify the production of this molecule and authentic mass spectral fragmentation characteristics from previous reports.

Transcriptional gene expression levels of each gene were detected by qPCR on mRNA isolated from the appropriate strains. To prevent degradation RNA was stabilized before cell lysis using RNAprotect bacterial reagent Qiagen . Subsequently total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit Qiagen combined with nuclease based removal of genomic DNA contaminants. cDNA was amplified using iScript cDNA synthesis kit Biorad . qPCR was carried out on a Bio Rad iCycler using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix Biorad . The level of expression of rrsA gene which is not subject to variable expression was used for normalization of qPCR values.Table 3 has primers used for qPCR. For each primer pair a standard curve was constructed with mRNA of as the template.

For constant upstream pathway expression a maximum is similarly observed with respect to the level of downstream pathway expression. This is attributed to an initial limitation of taxadiene production by low expression levels of the downstream pathway which is thus rate limiting with respect to taxadiene production. At high levels of downstream pathway expression we are likely seeing the negative effect of high copy number on cell physiology hence a maximum exists with respect to downstream pathway expression. These results demonstrate that dramatic changes in taxadiene accumulation can be obtained from changes within a narrow window of expression levels for the upstream and downstream pathways. For example a strain containing an additional copy of the upstream pathway on its chromosome under Trc promoter control Strain 8 produced 2000 fold more taxadiene than one overexpressing only the synthetic downstream pathway Strain 1 . Furthermore changing the order of the genes in the downstream synthetic operon from GT GPPS TS to TG TS GPPS resulted in 2 3 fold increase strains 1 4 compared to 5 8 11 and 14 . The observed results show that the key to taxadiene overproduction is ample downstream pathway capacity and careful balancing between the upstream precursor pathway with the downstream synthetic taxadiene pathway. Altogether the engineered strains established that the MEP pathway flux can be substantial if a wide range of expression levels for the endogenous upstream and synthetic downstream pathway are searched simultaneously.

To provide ample downstream pathway strength while minimizing the plasmid borne metabolic burden two new sets of 4 strains each were engineered strains 25 28 and 29 32 in which the downstream pathway was placed under the control of a strong promoter T7 while keeping a relatively low number of 5 and 10 copies respectively. It can be seen that while the taxadiene maximum is maintained at high downstream strength strains 21 24 a monotonic response is obtained at the low downstream pathway strength strains 17 20 . This observation prompted the construction of two additional sets of 4 strains each that maintained the same level of downstream pathway strength as before but expressed very low levels of the upstream pathway strains 25 28 and 29 32 . Additionally the operon of the upstream pathway of the latter strain set was chromosomally integrated. It can be seen that not only is the taxadiene maximum recovered albeit at very low upstream pathway levels but a much greater taxadiene maximum is attained 300 mg L . We believe this significant increase can be attributed to a decrease in cell s metabolic burden. This was achieved by 1 eliminating plasmid dependence through integration of the pathway into the chromosome and 2 attaining a fine balance between the upstream and downstream pathway expression.

The 32 recombinant constructs allowed us to adequately probe the modular pathway expression space and amplify 15000 fold improvement in taxadiene production. This is by far the highest production of terpenoids from MEP isoprenoid pathway reported . Additionally the observed fold improvements in terpenoid production are significantly higher than those of reported combinatorial metabolic engineering approaches that searched an extensive genetic space comprising up to a billion combinatorial variants of the isoprenoid pathway.This suggests that pathway optimization depends far more on fine balancing of the expression of pathway modules than multi source combinatorial gene optimization. The multiple maxima exhibited in the phenotypic landscape of underscores the importance of probing the expression space at sufficient resolution to identify the region of optimum overall pathway performance. depicts the fold improvements in taxadiene production from the modular pathway expression search.

Metabolomic analysis of the previous engineered strains identified an as yet unknown metabolite byproduct that correlated strongly with pathway expression levels and taxadiene production and . Although the chemical identity of the metabolite was unknown we hypothesized that it is an isoprenoid side product resulting from pathway diversion and has been anti correlated as a direct variable to the taxadiene production and from the engineered strains. A critical attribute of our optimal strains is the fine balancing that alleviates the accumulation of this metabolite resulting in higher taxadiene production. This balancing can be modulated at different levels from chromosome or different copy number plasmids using different promoters with significantly different taxadiene accumulation.

Subsequently the corresponding peak in the gas chromatography mass spectrometry GC MS chromatogram was identified as indole by GC MS H and C nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy studies . We found that taxadiene synthesis by strain 26 is severely inhibited by exogenous indole at indole levels higher than 100 mg L . Further increasing the indole concentration also inhibited cell growth with the level of inhibition being very strain dependent . Although the biochemical mechanism of indole interaction with the isoprenoid pathway is presently unclear the results in suggest a possible synergistic effect between indole and terpenoid compounds of the isoprenoid pathway in inhibiting cell growth. Without knowing the specific mechanism it appears strain 26 has mitigated the indole s effect which we carried forward for further study.

In order to explore the taxadiene producing potential under controlled conditions for the engineered strains fed batch cultivations of the three highest taxadiene accumulating strains 60 mg L from strain 22 125 mg L from strain 17 300 mg L from strain 26 were carried out in 1 L bioreactors . The fed batch cultivation studies were carried out as liquid liquid two phase fermentation using a 20 v v dodecane overlay. The organic solvent was introduced to prevent air stripping of secreted taxadiene from the fermentation medium as indicated by preliminary findings. In defined media with controlled glycerol feeding taxadiene productivity increased to 174 5 mg L SD 210 7 mg L SD and 1020 80 mg L SD respectively for strains 22 17 and 26 . Additionally taxadiene production significantly affected the growth phenotype acetate accumulation and glycerol consumption .

At 48 hrs the initial glycerol is depleted and the cultivation switches to a fed batch mode during which low but constant glycerol levels are maintained. This results in a low overall glycerol flux which for strains with high MEP flux strains 26 and 17 is mostly diverted to the MEP pathway while minimizing overflow metabolism. As a result acetic acid production is reduced or even totally eliminated. Regarding the decline in acetic acid concentration it is possible that acetic acid assimilation may have happened to some extent although this was not further investigated from a flux analysis standpoint. Some evaporation and dilution due to glycerol feed are further contributing to the observed acetic acid concentration decline. In contrast for strains with low MEP flux strain 22 flux diversion to the MEP pathway is not very significant so that glycerol flux still supplies all the necessary carbon and energy requirements. Overflow metabolism continues to occur leading to acetate secretion.

Clearly the high productivity and more robust growth of strain 26 allowed very high taxadiene accumulation. Further improvements should be possible through optimizing conditions in the bioreactor balancing nutrients in the growth medium and optimizing carbon delivery.

For a more detailed understanding of the engineered balance in pathway expression we quantified the transcriptional gene expression levels of dxs upstream pathway and TS downstream pathway for the highest taxadiene producing strains and neighboring strains from and D strains 17 22 and 25 32 B . As we hypothesized expression of the upstream pathway increased monotonically with promoter strength and copy number for the MEP vector from native promoter Trc T5 T7 and 10 copy and 20 copy plasmids as seen in the DXS expression . Thus we found that dxs expression level correlates well with the upstream pathway strength. Similar correlations were found for the other genes of the upstream pathway idi ispD and ispF B . In the downstream gene expression a 2 fold improvement was quantified after transferring the pathway from 5 to 10 copy plasmid 25 28 series and 29 32 series .

While promoter and copy number effects influenced the gene expressions secondary effects on the expression of the other pathway were also prominent. shows that for the same dxs expression cassettes by increasing the copy number of the TS plasmid from 5 to 10 dxs expression was increased. Interestingly the 5 copy TS plasmid strains 25 28 series contained substantially higher taxadiene yields and less growth D than the 10 copy TS plasmid. Control plasmids that did not contain the taxadiene heterologous pathway grew two fold higher densities implying growth inhibition in the strains 25 28 series is directly related to the taxadiene metabolic pathway and the accumulation of taxadiene and its direct intermediates . However the strain 29 32 series only showed modest increases in growth yield when comparing the empty control plasmids to the taxadiene expressing strains . This interplay between growth taxadiene production and expression level can also be seen with the plasmid based upstream expression vectors strain 17 and 22 . Growth inhibition was much larger in the 10 copy high taxadiene producing strain strain 17 compared to the 20 copy lower taxadiene producing strain strain 22 . Therefore product toxicity and carbon diversion to the heterologous pathway are likely to impede growth rather than plasmid maintenance.

Also unexpected was the profound effect of the upstream expression vector on downstream expression. would have two straight lines if there was no cross talk between the pathways. However 3 fold changes in TS expression are observed for different MEP expression vectors. This is likely due to significant competition for resources raw material and energy that are withdrawn from the host metabolism for overexpression of both the four upstream and two downstream genes.Compared to the control strain 25c a 4 fold growth inhibition was observed with strain 25 indicated that high overexpression of synthetic taxadiene pathway induced toxicity altering the growth phenotype compared to the overexpression of native pathway . However as upstream expression increased downstream expression was reduced inadvertently in our case to desirable levels to balance the upstream and downstream pathways minimizing growth inhibition strain 26 .

At the extreme of protein overexpression T7 promoter driven MEP pathway resulted in severe growth inhibition due to the synthesis of four proteins at high level strains 28 and 32 . Expression of the TS genes by T7 does not appear to have as drastic effect by itself. The high rates of protein synthesis from the T7 induced expression B could lead to the down regulation of the protein synthesis machinery including components of housekeeping genes from early growth phase impairs the cell growth and lower the increase in biomass.We hypothesized that our observed complex growth phenotypes are cumulative effects of 1 toxicity induced by activation of isoprenoid taxadiene metabolism and 2 and the effects of high recombinant protein expression. Altogether our multivariate modular pathway engineering approach generated unexpected diversity in terpenoid metabolism and its correlation to the pathway expression and cell physiology. Rational design of microbes for secondary metabolite production will require an understanding of pathway expression that goes beyond a linear independent understanding of promoter strengths and copy numbers. However simple multivariate approaches as employed here can introduce the necessary diversity to both 1 find high producers and 2 provide a landscape for the systematic investigation of higher order effects that are dominant yet underappreciated in metabolic pathway engineering.

A central feature in the biosynthesis of Taxol is oxygenation at multiple positions of the taxane core structure reactions that are considered to be mediated by cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases.After completion of the committed cyclization step of the pathway the parent olefin taxa 4 5 11 12 diene is next hydroxylated at the C5 position by a cytochrome P450 enzyme representing the first of eight oxygenation steps of the taxane core on route to Taxol .Thus a key step towards engineering Taxol producing microbes is the development of P450 based oxidation chemistry in vivo. The first oxygenation step is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 taxadiene 5 hydroxylase an unusual monooxygenase catalyzing the hydroxylation reaction along with double bond migration in the diterpene precursor taxadiene . We report the first successful extension of the synthetic pathway from taxadiene to taxadien 5 ol and present the first examples of in vivo production of any functionalized Taxol intermediates in

In general functional expression of plant cytochrome P450 is challengingdue to the inherent limitations of bacterial platforms such as the absence of electron transfer machinery cytochrome P450 reductases and translational incompatibility of the membrane signal modules of P450 enzymes due to the lack of an endoplasmic reticulum. Recently through transmembrane TM engineering and the generation of chimera enzymes of P450 and CPR reductases some plant P450 s have been expressed in for the biosynthesis of functional molecules.Still every plant cytochrome p450 is unique in its transmembrane signal sequence and electron transfer characteristics from its reductase counterpart.Our initial studies were focused on optimizing the expression of codon optimized synthetic taxadiene 5 hydroxylase by N terminal transmembrane engineering and generating chimera enzymes through translational fusion with the CPR redox partner from the species Taxus cytochrome P450 reductase TCPR .One of the chimera enzymes generated At24T5 OH tTCPR was highly efficient in carrying out the first oxidation step with more than 98 taxadiene conversion to taxadien 5 ol and the byproduct 5 12 Oxa 3 11 cyclotaxane OCT .

Compared to the other chimeric P450s At24T5 OH tTCPR yielded two fold higher 21 mg L production of taxadien 5 ol. As well the weaker activity of At8T5 OH tTCPR and At24T5 OH tTCPR resulted in accumulation of a recently characterized byproduct a complex structural rearrangement of taxadiene into the cyclic ether 5 12 Oxa 3 11 cyclotaxane OCT .The byproduct accumulated at approximately equal amounts as the desired product taxadien 5 ol. The OCT formation was mediated by an unprecedented Taxus cytochrome P450 reaction sequence involving oxidation and subsequent cyclizations.Thus it seems likely that by protein engineering of the taxadiene 5 hydroxylases termination of the reaction before cyclization will prevent the accumulation of such undesirable byproduct and channeling the flux to taxadien 5 ol could be achieved.

The productivity of strain 26 At24T5 OH tTCPR was significantly reduced relatively to that of taxadiene production by the parent strain 26 300 mg L with a concomitant increase in the accumulation of the previously described uncharacterized metabolite. No taxadiene accumulation was observed. Apparently the introduction of an additional medium copy plasmid 10 copy p10T7 bearing the At24T5 OH tTCPR construct disturbed the carefully engineered balance in the upstream and downstream pathway of strain 26. Small scale fermentations were carried out in bioreactors to quantify the alcohol production by strain 26 At24T5 OH tTCPR. The time course profile of taxadien 5 ol accumulation indicates alcohol production of up to 58 3 mg L with an equal amount of the OCT byproduct produced. The observed alcohol production was 2400 fold higher than previous production in Further increases of taxadien 5 ol production are likely possible through pathway optimization and protein engineering.

The multivariate modular approach of pathway optimization has yielded very high producing strains of a critical Taxol precursor. Furthermore the recombinant constructs have been equally effective in redirecting flux towards the synthesis of other complex pharmaceutical compounds such as mono sesqui and di terpene geraniol linalool amorphadiene and levopimaradiene products engineered from the same pathway unpublished results . Thus our pathway engineering opens new avenues to bio synthesize natural products especially in the context of microbially derived terpenoids for use as chemicals and fuels from renewable resources. By focusing on the universal terpenoid precursors IPP and DMAPP it was possible to first define the critical pathway modules and then modulate expression such as to optimally balance the pathway modules for seamless precursor conversion and minimal intermediate accumulation. This approach seems to be more effective than combinatorial searches of large genetic spaces and also does not depend on a high throughput screen.

The MEP pathway is energetically balanced and thus overall more efficient in converting either glucose or glycerol to isoprenoids. Yet during the past 10 years many attempts at engineering the MEP pathway in to increase the supply of the key precursors IPP and DMAPP for carotenoid sesquiterpenoidand diterpenoidoverproduction met with limited success. This inefficiency was attributed to unknown regulatory effects associated specifically with the expression of the MEP pathway in . Here we provide evidence that such limitations are correlated with the accumulation of the metabolite indole owing to the non optimal expression of the pathway which inhibits the isoprenoid pathway activity. Taxadiene overproduction under conditions of indole formation suppression establishes the MEP pathway as a very efficient route for biosynthesis of pharmaceutical and chemical products of the isoprenoid family. One simply needs to carefully balance the modular pathways as suggested by our multivariate modular pathway engineering approach.

For successful microbial production of Taxol demonstration of the chemical decoration of the taxadiene core by P450 based oxidation chemistry is essential.Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases constitute about one half of the 19 distinct enzymatic steps in the Taxol biosynthetic pathway. Characteristically these genes show unusual high sequence similarity with each other 70 but low similarity 

Prior studies on structure activity relationship on Taxol have shown that alterations made either by removal or addition of some of its functional groups did not change materially the activity of the Taxol.Such studies however were limited due to the restricted ability to introduce changes by chemical synthesis. Availability of a microbial path for Taxol synthesis will drastically expand the space of chemical modifications that can be examined thus increasing the probability of identifying more potent drug candidates. This offers exciting new opportunities for drug development especially when considering that such drug candidates will also be associated with an efficient production route.

In the past few decades Taxol has spawned more interest within the scientific communities and general public than any other natural product drug candidate.A major supply crisis is predicted from the projected increase in the use of Taxol or Taxol analogs for cancer chemotherapy requiring new production routes such as engineering of Taxol biosynthetic machinery in microbes.While a few endophytic fungi of species have been isolated capable of producing Taxol naturally these microbial systems have yet to demonstrate suitability for sustainable production of the drug.The results reported here represent a disruptive step towards a microbially derived Taxol or Taxol precursor by removing the bottlenecks in the committed precursor pathway. Furthermore the assembly of a synthetic pathway offers new possibilities to tailor Taxol analogs by selectively engineering the pathway thereby altering the taxane structure. These developments raise optimism for a microbial route for the cost effective production of Taxol or suitable Taxol precursors.
