The patent owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This application relates to methods for fabrication of thermoplastic and or composite materials and to structures resulting from use of such methods.

Efforts to more economically provide lightweight long life structures subject to stress and related fatigue such as airframes for the assembly of aircraft have resulted in increasing use of thermoplastic and or related composite materials. The development of various composite materials and methods of fabricating structures using such materials has highlighted an as yet unmet need for a process that might be utilized to efficiently effectively and reliably join thermoplastic or composite materials together.

In general design methods associated with prior art welding of various types of plastics have encountered various difficulties. Some methods previously suggested have had or would have difficulty as a practical matter in reliably joining components together. For example the use of welding of thermoset type materials has not been widely utilized in structures that require reliable joint life.

As a consequence of difficulties with thermoset materials interest has grown in the potential for use of thermoplastic materials in airframe construction or for other aerostructures. A key issue however is how to provide strength particularly in the Z direction in a joint between two thermoplastic component parts. Thus there remains a need for a method for fabrication of a composite structure that is capable of reliably joining thermoplastic material parts. Moreover it would be advantageous to provide a method which facilitates the assembly of parts made from materials desirable for use in aerostructures such as polyetheretherketone PEEK .

The foregoing figures being merely exemplary contain various elements that may be present or omitted from actual apparatus that may be constructed to practice the methods taught herein and to manufacture the composite structures as set forth herein. An attempt has been made to draw the figures in a way that illustrates at least those elements that are significant for an understanding of the various methods taught herein for the manufacture of composite structures. However various other elements for a method of manufacture of composite structures using thermoplastic welding using heated inserts may be utilized in order to provide composite structures.

Exemplary method s for the fabrication of composite structures is set forth herein. Composite structures made by such method s are also described herein. For purposes of this specification unless expressly set forth otherwise or unless another interpretation is required by the specific context mentioned the various materials described in detail herein are provided for exemplary purposes only and other composite structures may be constructed using plastic materials which may be heated to a glass transition temperature to provide for suitable amalgamation of a thermoplastic matrix in adjacent parts and in a film portion insert as described herein using the method s provided herein.

Attention is directed to which provides a general overview of a method for manufacture of a composite structure. As shown in a first composite part having a first surface is provided. A second composite part having a second surface is provided. In an embodiment the first composite part and the second composite part have a common thermoplastic matrix component M not shown . For example both of the first composite part and the second composite part may be include a thermoplastic matrix component M that includes polyetheretherketone PEEK . To join the first composite part and the second composite part the parts are juxtaposed so that the first surface and the second surface define a weldment area therebetween perhaps better appreciated in at which the first composite part and the second composite part are to be joined. An insert is provided. In an embodiment the insert includes 1 a film portion that includes the common thermoplastic matrix component M that is found in first composite part and in the second composite part . The insert also includes an electrical resistance heating element .

As shown in and better seen in the electrical resistance heating element may include a first end and a second end and a plurality of coils about the film portion . To energize and heat the electrical resistance heating element electric current is applied between the first end and the second end in a manner that will be understood to those of skill in the art and which need not be further described in detail. In general electrical power is supplied between first end and second end as noted by power supply P in . Such power supply P may be portable in nature and thus useful for making repairs such as patches in aerostructures i.e. those structures manufactured for flight or any units components or sections of aircraft or other vehicles capable of flight . The precise amount of electrical current required to generate an amount of heat for accomplishing the welding process may be determined by a practitioner without undue experimentation. The actual amount of electrical current and the time which it is applied will vary depending upon the size of the first composite part and the second composite part as well as on the thickness T see of the film portion and the material used for the electrical resistance heating element itself.

As noted in in an embodiment the film portion may be provided with a plurality of notches for location therein of a coil winding of coils of the electrical resistance heating element . The notches may be spaced apart a suitable distance D. As shown in in an embodiment notches may be spaced apart a centerline distance D of about zero point one 0.1 inches. However such spacing may be varied as may be necessary or desirable to achieve the results taught according to the methods described herein. In various embodiments the electrical resistance heating element may be provided in the form of a wire. In various embodiments the electrical resistance heating element may be provided in a brass material. In various embodiments an electrical resistance heating element of brass wire of about eight mils 0.008 inches in diameter may be wrapped around the film portion . In an embodiment an electrical resistance heating element of brass wire may be located within notches .

Attention is directed to and A wherein the insert including film portion and coils of the electrical resistance heating element is placed between a first surface and a second surface . A selected electric current is applied through an electrical resistance heating element for a selected time to heat the film portion to at least a glass transition temperature. During heating the electrical current is applied to heat the film portion and also to heat a portion of the thermoplastic matrix M at or adjacent a first surface and a second surface in the first composite part and in the second composite part respectively. In an embodiment a current of about three 3 amps may be applied for about one minute to an electrical resistance heating element to preheat the film portion before initiation of the application of pressure between the first composite part and the second composite part . After such preheating cycle is completed then the electrical current may be pulsed on and off for the next two minutes. In an embodiment the current may be applied at about six point five 6.5 amps when using the specified wire namely an eight 8 mil wire. In an embodiment it has been found that a selected time schedule of about fifteen seconds on followed by five seconds off provides adequate heating. The pulsing of the electrical current to the electrical resistance heating element allows maintenance of heating thus allowing heat to permeate the entire weldment area yet prevents overheating or burning of the materials involved. During at least a portion of the selected time pressure is applied as indicated by reference arrows and in to the first composite part and to the second composite part respectively to urge the first surface toward the second surface . During heating a low fusion pressure of about one pound per square inch may be adequate to press the first composite part and the second composite part together. With adequate heating of the film portion the first surface and the second surface the thermoplastic matrix M in the said film portion bonds with the thermoplastic matrix M at the first surface and at the second surface to form a composite structure such as composite structure seen in or composite structure seen in . During heating and forming of a welded composite structure the film portion and the thermoplastic matrix M in or adjacent first surface in a first composite part and in or adjacent second surface in a second composite part should be melted without softening and distorting most of the thermoplastic material of the first composite part and of the second composite part . Consequently a careful evaluation and selection of applicable electrical current to be applied and of the selected time for which it is to be applied may be made as appropriate in particular circumstances. When the welded composite structure or has been formed by application of pressure and heat the electrical current applied to the electrical resistance heating element is terminated. Then the welded composite structures and i.e. the parts being welded together are pressed together using a high fusion pressure in the manner indicated by reference arrows and in which may in an embodiment be with a force that produces approximately one hundred pounds per square inch between the parts i.e. at the weldment joint as noted in or . The entire structure is then allowed to cool. The high applied pressure causes at least a portion if not most of the melted film portion to be squeezed out of the weldment joint leaving Z pining fibers further discussed below embedded between the first composite part and the second composite part . Since a portion of the first composite part and of the second composite part may be affected by the welding procedure such parts may be designed by providing extra material adjacent a first surface and adjacent a second surface which extra material is not needed for the structural integrity of the finished composite structure or .

In various embodiments of the method and of a composite structure made by the method the film portion may further include strengthening fibers. In an embodiment carbon fibers within the film portion may be utilized. In an embodiment the strengthening fibers may include Z pins. In an embodiment Z pins may be provided within the structure of film portion . In an embodiment as indicated in external Z pins may be provided. Such external Z pins may be provided in a height H above a surface S of film portion . In various embodiments the Z pins may be provided at a selected areal density. In various embodiments the Z pins may be provided in a material of a type contained in the first composite part. In various embodiments the Z pins may be provided in a material of a type contained in the second composite part. In an embodiment the Z pins may be provided in carbon fiber.

Generally Z pinning is the reinforcement of a composite structure in the Z direction using fiber metal or other materials for pins that are disposed in the Z direction wherein the Z direction is usually defined as along an axis orthogonal to the plane of a joint between parts . The Z pins used may be provided in a selected array pattern and in a selected areal density. Composite fabrication using Z pinning has been described in various patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 5 882 756 issued Mar. 16 1999 to Alston et al. and entitled Composite Patches Having Z Pin Reinforcement and U.S. Pat. No. 6 436 507 B1 issued Aug. 20 2002 to Pannell and entitled Composites Joined with Z Pin Reinforcement e.g. see Z pins in various figures the disclosures of each of just mentioned U.S. Patents are included herein in their entirety by this reference.

Attention is now directed to wherein in may be seen that the application of pressure to urge a first composite part and a second composite part together may result in emergence of residual material along a weldment joint between the first surface and the second surface . As can be seen by comparison between in an embodiment the method may further include removal of the residual material from the composite structure so that a finished composite structure is provided. Removal of residual material may involve removal of a portion of thermoplastic matrix M that originated from the film portion . Also in it may be noted that in an embodiment electrical resistance heating elements may be formed by embodiment of wire in the film portion and as such segment ends of heating elements may be seen. In either case whether the electrical heating element is provided in the manner noted in or in the manner noted as heating element in removal of excess residual material may involve removal of a portion of the heating element.

In general the film portion may be provided in a shape and size e.g. length L and width W as noted in at least as large as the weldment area defined between the first surface and the second surface . In an embodiment the film portion may be provided in a shape and size conforming to the weldment area defined between the first surface and the second surface . In various embodiments the film portion may be provided in a selected thickness T. In an embodiment the film portion may be provided in a thickness T of about zero point zero three zero inches 0.030 inches . In various embodiments uniformity of thickness of film portion T as used in a particular weld operation results in better weld performance. In some embodiments the variation V in thickness T should not vary anywhere in the film portion by more than about two thousandths of an inch 0.002 inches . For example in an embodiment when a thickness T of thirty thousandths of an inch 0.030 inches is used then the thickness T should not be less than twenty eight thousandths of an inch 0.028 inches or more than thirty two thousandths of an inch 0.032 inches .

Attention is now directed to which provides a diagrammatic illustration of a first part and a second part which are to be joined. In an embodiment a weldment may be made along a first surface is set out in a first part at an angle alpha as compared to the longitudinal centerline of first part which is shown here parallel to edgewall wherein the angle is not ninety degrees 90 but at an acute angle i.e. less than ninety degrees 90 . In such an embodiment the length of a welded joint between first part and second part is of length which is longer than the width of a first part or width of a second part . A second surface may be provided in a second part at a complementary angle beta that is larger than ninety degrees 90 as compared to the longitudinal centerline of second part which as shown is parallel to edgewall . In an embodiment as illustrated in corresponding angles delta and sigma respectively may thus complete setting out an angled cut portion between the first and second composite parts and to be joined. This method provides increased surface area along an angled joint as compared to a joint that might be made at a straight cut at a right angle as illustrated in for example. This increase in surface area of angled joint between the first and second composite parts and still uses a film portion as described above and may include Z pins to assist in formation of a strong bond between the first composite part and the second composite part when welded together in the manner described herein. Similar to the reference arrows and noted in above the first part and second part may be urged together in the directions noted by reference arrows and . Alternately depending on the Z pin orientation a slightly different angle for pressure may be selected but in any event first part is pressed toward film portion very generally in a selected direction as indicated by reference arrows and second part is pressed toward film portion very generally in a selected direction as indicated by reference arrows . More generally it should be understood that the method s described herein may be utilized for various weld shapes or types including sheer welds butt welds or angle welds.

The method s described herein may be used for fabrication of a variety of thermoplastic matrix containing materials to produce composite structures. Further the method s described herein may be utilized to fabricate a patched composite structure component or part. The method s may be used with a variety of thermoplastic composites. Further the method s are compatible with the use of carbon fibers in composite structures. The method s may be advantageously utilized with composite parts that include polyetheretherketone PEEK which is a linear aromatic polymer that is semi crystalline and widely regarded as a high performance thermoplastic material. PEEK polymers include repeating monomers of two ether groups and a ketone group. PEEK is particularly advantageous for use in aerostructures since it is lightweight is resistant to fluids such as hydraulic fluids and has good heat and abrasion resistance. Thus in an embodiment a composite structure such as composite structure or may be manufactured using polyetheretherketone. Consequently in an embodiment the first composite part may be polyetheretherketone. In an embodiment the second composite part may be polyetheretherketone. In an embodiment the film portion may be provided in polyetheretherketone. More generally composite structures provided by the method s set forth herein may be composed of a thermoplastic. Further the method s described herein may be useful for providing a patch in a composite structure.

As an example after extensive experimentation using PEEK with chopped carbon fiber placed in a random direction it was discovered that the use of a three hundredths of an inch 0.030 inches thick film portion wherein the with variation in thickness T was less than two thousandths of an inch 0.002 inches when using an eight 8 mil diameter wire with the amperage and pressure profile indicated above reliably produced a good weld time after time. Blocks of PEEK chopped carbon fiber composite and PEEK composite film portions that were two 2 inches wide by one half inch 0.5 inch high in cross section were welded as taught herein. The finished structure after welding was tested in tension. The specified tensile strength of unreinforced PEEK is five thousand 5 000 pounds per square inch psi . The specified tensile strength of the chopped carbon fiber PEEK used for testing was nineteen thousand 19 000 pounds per square inch psi . A tensile test of an unwelded composite PEEK specimen verified the nineteen thousand 19 000 pounds per square inch psi strength. The welding and testing of eight PEEK specimens in a proof of concept experiment produced a good weld every time. The finished welded product had a tensile strength of one hundred twenty percent 120 to one hundred thirty percent 130 of unreinforced PEEK tensile strength. Those tests indicate that not only was the welded PEEK matrix material continuous and undamaged but that at least some of the chopped carbon fibers had crossed the weld boundary in the Z direction and thus were acting as Z pins.
