In some aspects the present invention is directed to a system and method for self service call routing and intelligent transition from self service to agent assisted service.

In other aspects the present invention is directed to a system and method for identifying a caller via a voice e.g. telephone and or video call connection and matching the caller to a web interaction or user session involving the caller. More particularly in these other aspects the present invention may comprise an arrangement which may utilize web components a server and unique agent contact numbers e.g. one or more telephone numbers one or more uniform resource locators URLs and or one or more session initiation protocol numbers SIPs to uniquely identify and match a user s web interaction with their voice and or video interaction with a human agent.

Automated telephone based customer support systems such as auto attendant AA systems which may also be referred to as automated attendant systems virtual receptionist systems interactive voice response IVR systems AA IVR systems and other names have evolved from relatively simple devices to more complex computerized systems for handling calls pertaining to a variety of issues. Modern AA systems can often allow a caller to resolve an issue through self service without the need for a human agent to provide agent assisted service. And in cases where agent assisted service is required to address a caller s issue an AA system may facilitate connecting the caller to the appropriate agent for resolving the issue.

For example an AA system may automatically answer a telephone call from a caller play a standard message to the caller and then await a response from the caller. In some AA systems this response may come in the form of the caller depressing a particular telephone key which often generates a standardized set of tones called Dual tone multi frequency tones DTMF and or in the form of voice input for more sophisticated voice recognition systems. Based on the caller response the system may process the incoming call appropriately to resolve one or more issues which prompted the caller to place the call.

Auto attendant systems often have a complex menu structure via which an incoming caller may for example proceed through a complex decision tree being presented with a series of recorded voice prompts or generated voice prompts utilizing Text To Speech and providing corresponding responses in order to connect the incoming caller with a particular person departmental function or information to resolve the incoming caller s issue s . Some AA systems operate using voice communication over traditional Public Switched Telephone Networks PSTN wireless radio infrastructure and or voice over IP technologies.

Many commercial owners or users of AA systems also operate websites which can provide additional information to a customer and in this case one or more voice prompts which are provided by the auto attendant system may encourage incoming callers to stop using the telephone based AA system and instead to switch to using a web browser to engage in a self service operation with a computer based customer support system.

However callers to an organization s telephone based auto attendant system may experience frustration with unsuccessful IVR interactions or encounter long wait times during peak call periods. Computer based customer support systems may provide e.g. via a network a broader range of automated information and with little or no wait times where a customer seeks a resolution to the customer s issue during a self service session. However if the computer based customer support system fails to allow the customer to resolve an issue the customer may still need to speak with a customer service agent to resolve the issue.

Furthermore if a user engages in a user session with a website e.g. a self service session with a self service application hosted by the website before it is determined that agent assisted service is to be performed it would be desirable to convey to the human agent user data generated during the user session user session data including for example a history of the nodes of a decision tree which were traversed during the interaction of the user with a self service application. In that case it would further be desirable to be able to uniquely identify and match a user s web interaction with that user s voice and or video interaction with a human agent.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide a system and method which supports self service and which can facilitate and streamline the operation of a subsequent agent assisted service session with a human agent for example via telephony web chat web based video etc.

The present invention comprises a system and method for identifying a caller via a voice e.g. telephone and or video call connection and matching the caller to a web interaction or user session involving the caller.

In one aspect of the invention a method of associating a particular user interaction with an access number method comprises determining that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent after the user has initiated a user session via a website wherein the user session produces user session data that is stored in one or more memory devices generating one or more temporary agent access numbers through which a communication channel may be established between a user and a human agent for the agent initiated session communicating a selected one or more of the temporary agent access numbers to the user in response to the determination that an agent assisted service session should be initiated establishing a communication channel between the user and the human agent via a particular agent access number among the selected one or more temporary agent access numbers the communication channel being used for the agent assisted session associating the user session data with the agent assisted session and communicating the user session data to the human agent in conjunction with the agent assisted session.

In another aspect of the invention a non transitory data storage medium has stored thereon instructions for causing one or more processors to execute a process. The process comprises determining that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent after the user has initiated a user session via a website wherein the user session produces user session data that is stored in one or more memory devices generating one or more temporary agent access numbers through which a communication channel may be established between a user and a human agent for the agent initiated session communicating a selected one or more of the temporary agent access numbers to the user in response to the determination that an agent assisted service session should be initiated establishing a communication channel between the user and the human agent via a particular agent access number among the selected one or more temporary agent access numbers the communication channel being used for the agent assisted session associating the user session data with the agent assisted session and communicating the user session data to the human agent in conjunction with the agent assisted session.

In the description to follow an individual may be referred to as a user a caller or a customer. It should be understand that these terms are used interchangeably depending on context to refer to an individual who has an issue which they wish to resolve. The issue may pertain to a technical problem that the individual is experiencing with a product or service provided by a company or organization a need for information about a company or organization and or its products or services a billing problem or any of a variety of other issues for which an individual may seek assistance through an AA system and or via an interaction with a self service application and or via agent assisted support.

Self service access terminal includes a display device one or more processors memory and one or more user input devices which may include a touch screen a keypad a microphone a keyboard a trackball a mouse and or any other known input device. The memory may comprise a non transitory data storage medium and may have stored thereon instructions for causing the processor s to execute a process for supporting an interaction of a user with a self service application as described in greater detail below.

In some embodiments self service access terminal may include an antenna a transmitter and a receiver for communicating over a wireless network. In some embodiments self service access terminal may be capable of voice calls and or data communication over a wireless network for example a 3G or 4G network. In some embodiments self service access terminal may include a wireless local area network WLAN adaptor and antenna for communicating via a WLAN such as an IEEE 802.11 network. In some embodiments self service access terminal may be able to establish an Internet connection via either a wireless network e.g. a 3G or 4G network and or over a WLAN.

In more detail depicts a user interface and application with the ability to render or display various UI controls including but not limited to text areas input fields and virtual buttons . Other embodiments may include the ability to render commonly accepted UI elements including but not limited to listboxes combo boxes multi select scrollable lists and so forth.

In operation still referring to a user may navigate through a series of user interface screens UI screens which are displayed on a display device of self service access terminal selecting various controls available via the various UI screens in order to resolve a specific issue i.e. perform a self service interaction with a self service application which may reside in whole or in part in one or more memory devices of self service access terminal and or a remotely located self service server which will be described in greater detail below . UI screens are updated in response to user input received via UI screens until such time that user s issue has been resolved or until such time that the user chooses to communicate with a contact center agent for agent assisted service to resolve the user s issue. In some embodiments by the series of actions of presenting a UI screen to a user receiving user input in response to the UI screen and presenting a new UI screen in response to the user input a user may traverse through nodes of a decision tree or call tree of a self service application with which the user interacts where each node has associated therewith a corresponding UI screen . Here it should be noted that a decision tree is a logical construct rather than a physical entity and represents an abstraction of a complex algorithm which includes a plurality of optional paths which may be followed by a user while engaged in a self service session to resolve an issue. In some embodiments data representing such a decision tree e.g. metadata may be stored locally in memory of self service access terminal while in other embodiments self service access terminal may execute a client server session with a remotely located self service server where the data representing the decision tree is stored in a database and which communicates data for the UI screen associated with each node of the decision tree to self service access terminal .

Still referring to buttons may exist on UI screen to allow a user at any time during the interaction with the self service application to request an agent assisted service session to resolve the user s issue. The agent assisted service session may take place via a voice call or via a web chat with an agent at a call center. Additionally in some embodiments a button may allow the user to request a call back from the call center agent. Here a Call refers to establishing a voice connection to a call center agent either via regular phone channel e.g. the public switched telephone network PSTN if self service access terminal includes the capability for such phone calls or via a voice over Internet protocol VoIP client installed and running on self service access terminal . In some embodiments buttons allowing the user to place a call to an agent may additionally display the expected hold time that user would experience if calling or web chatting with an agent at the contact center.

In some embodiments when self service access terminal is executing the self service application in a standalone mode and does not presently have access to a communication channel for an HTTP or TCP IP communication session e.g. not presently able to access the Internet then the user may initiate a call to the call center agent via a separate telephone device. In that case UI screen may notify a user of a unique ID assigned to the user s current interaction with the self service application and an AA system to which the user connects via the separate telephone device

In some embodiments self service access terminal or may have associated therewith a variety of sensors and or data gathering devices such as a global positioning system GPS receiver a camera a card swipe or near field readers and or other sensors.

In the description to follow detailed examples and descriptions will be provided in the context of a user employing self service access terminal in particular a smart phone. However as noted above it should be understood that a variety of other devices or platforms may be employed for the self service access terminal without loss of generality.

Referring now to there is shown a mobile device as one possible embodiment of self service access terminal by means of which the user conducts an interaction with a self service application. The self service application executing on self service access terminal retrieves the next step in the self service process from self service application server utilizing either an HTTP or TCP IP connection e.g. via the Internet . HTTP connections are by definition stateless and one or more embodiments of the invention support stateless and stateful operations based on the underlying protocol. Self service application server receives requests from self service access terminal processes logic retrieves data for the next node of a decision tree or call tree from self service application database and returns data associated with the next node to self service access terminal .

In an alternate embodiment the self service application resides on self service access terminal which is able to cache the interaction steps minimizing round trips communications with self service application server . In such a cached deployment a user may be able to navigate through the entire self service session or a subset of such session without communication back to self service application server allowing for operation in a disconnected or offline mode wherein self service access terminal is not in communication from the self service application server and indeed may performs the steps of navigating the decision tree for a self service session without any communication with any external device. In that case self service access terminal may store in a memory device thereof metadata for the processor s of self service access terminal to present the self service application to user as series of UI screens .

In some embodiments self service application server can optionally interact with and integrate with Line of Business LOB applications to retrieve relevant customer or supporting information including but not limited to customer information pertaining to customer information systems billing data pertaining to billing systems and knowledgebases. Data from LOB application s can affect logic flow in self service application server and return the results or interpretation of the results back to self service access terminal . Data from LOB application s may also be proactively pushed by self service application server to self service access terminal without requiring the user to have initiated the request.

In some embodiments self service application server can optionally interact with CTI server in order to initiate a call voice chat session with an agent depicted in further detail in or to determine current hold times or to initiate a call back request. CTI server may be supplied by various vendors.

In some embodiments self service application server can interface to and integrate with the applications running on the agent computer to communicate to agent computer data associated with a user s interaction with the self service application. Examples of such integration to agent computer may include but are not limited to providing a screen pop of incoming caller information to an agent using once the user of self service access terminal requests to place a voice call to the contact center providing a detailed history of the sequences performed by user on self service access terminal and the self service interaction including the pages generated by self service application server and data retrieved from LOB applications . In some embodiments the agent is able to see on agent computer a full call path or interaction history or Call Navigation Path performed by the user of self service access terminal prior to or simultaneously with establishing the voice connection.

In some embodiments whenever a user initiates an interaction through system the a unique ID Interaction ID is assigned to the interaction and the interaction state context data and steps performed are continually saved on self service application server and retrievable by this unique Interaction ID. The Interaction ID may be used to retrieve the details at a later time and may also be used to continue or restart an interaction at a later time by restoring the context state and data entered previously.

An initial self service session may be initiated by a user starting or launching a self service application via self service access terminal depicted in by process . In some embodiments self service access terminal establishes contact with self service application server and downloads data associated with a first page or UI screen of the self service application depicted by processes and . The first page or UI screen may be associated with a node e.g. a starting node of a decision tree see associated with the self service application. Self service application server may determine the best starting node for a particular interaction with the self service application based on any number of business rules including but not limited to previous interaction data and results data collected from LOB systems current Contact Center agent availability and or the current state of self service access terminal .

Self service access terminal may display the first UI screen on a display device e.g. a touch screen associated with self service access terminal . The user may interact with the self service application via self service access terminal by selecting an appropriate option or button presented on the UI screen or otherwise by providing user supplied input as depicted in process . In some embodiments at all times during the process self service access terminal may communicate to self service application server environmental data gathered from one or more sensors and or data gathering devices associated with self service access terminal such as GPS data image data a card swipe data etc. User selection of an option via UI screen may initiate communication of the user supplied input from self service access terminal to self service application server where self service application server may store the user supplied input in self service application database for example in a data file associated with a unique Interaction ID for this particular self service session. Furthermore based at least in part on the user supplied input self service application server may navigate the decision tree to reach a next node of the decision tree. The next node may a UI screen associated therewith and self service application server may communicate self service data associated with that UI screen back to self service access terminal as depicted by process . In some embodiments at all times during the process the self service application server may have the ability to connect to LOB application s to retrieve data e.g. customer data or business data and communicate this data to self service access terminal . Processes and may repeat until the problem has been resolved a completed self service interaction or until a node in the decision tree is reached which indicates that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent.

A node in the decision tree indicating that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between the user and a human agent may be reached in various ways including for example the receipt of user supplied input via a UI screen whereby the user requests a call back or that the self service application initiate a call to an agent or by the user placing a call to a call center agent or by a dead end in the decision tree where the designer of the self service application has determined that resolution of the problem will require an agent assisted service session.

In some cases the user may initiate an agent assisted service session via a button of a UI screen of the self service application as displayed on the display device of self service access terminal depicted in by an optional process . In that case the user supplied input initiating the agent assisted service session may be communicated from self service access terminal to self service application server depicted in by an optional process . In other cases the design of the decision tree for self service application may include or more nodes where an agent assisted service session is initiated automatically by the self service application. In some embodiments when an agent assisted service session is to be initiated a user may be presented with an option via a UI screen to place a call immediately or to request a call back from an agent when the agent becomes available. In order to assist a user in making a decision as to whether to place a call or to request a call back from an agent in some embodiments self service application server is able to integrate with CTI server to determine an approximate current wait or hold time based on the particular queue or agent group which is needed to resolve a particular issue.

Regardless of whether a user requests a call back whether a call is initiated by the user manually or automatically by the self service application self service application server communicates data associated with the user s interaction with the self service application to agent computer which displays information to the human agent depicted in as a process . The data may include user data environmental data and or a detailed interaction data representing a history of the nodes of the decision tree which were traversed during the interaction of the user with the self service application. Further in some embodiments technology may allow automation of entering data received into applications running on agent desktop in order to reduce handling time by the agent .

In some embodiments to initiate an agent assisted session a call may be automatically placed from self service access terminal to CTI server . In other embodiments a user may manually initiate the call via self service access terminal depicted in as an optional process . In still other embodiments where self service access terminal is not able to be connected to CTI server a user may place the call using a separate telephone. As explained above the call may be conducted over a standard phone channel via the PSTN or using VoIP.

Regardless of the method a call connection is established between self service access terminal and CTI server depicted in as process . CTI server routes the call to the agent telephone and or agent computer depending on the nature of the call PSTN VoIP etc. and the CTI server as depicted in as process . The agent processes the call via agent telephone and or agent computer depicted in as process . Also via agent computer the agent accesses the data associated with the user s interaction with the self service application including for example user data environmental data and or a detailed interaction data representing a history of the nodes of the decision tree which were traversed during the interaction of the user with the self service application depicted in as process . Finally the agent and the user communicate with each other to resolve the user s issue depicted in as processes and .

In the example a user may be prompted with choice lists to select the nature of the self service interaction choice buttons and user also has the ability to enter alpha numeric data .

As discussed above if a user engages in a user session e.g. a self service session with a self service application and it is subsequently determined that agent assisted service is to be performed it would be desirable to convey to the human agent data generated during the user session user session data . This may include in various embodiments user interactions with a website a history of the nodes of a decision tree which were traversed during the interaction of the user with a self service application etc. In that case it would further be desirable to be able to uniquely identify and match a user s web interaction for example with that user s voice and or video call to and interaction with a human agent.

In some embodiments as will be described in greater detail below an arrangement of components to meet this need may include a user interaction server an application programming interface API an optional web tracking component an optional web display component a temporary agent access number pool e.g. temporarily telephone number pool and telephony elements. In some embodiments a website may use the API or web tracking component to track and monitor certain user interactions with the website and to store on the user interaction server user session data representing these interactions. Alternatively the website may track and monitor the user s interactions with existing tools and use to the API to store on the user interaction server user session data representing the user s interactions. The web display component or API can also be used by the website to receive a temporary access number such as a temporary phone number or a contact number such as an IP address SIP contact or other from the user interaction server to display to the user. The temporary phone number may be reserved in the user interaction server for the user for a configurable period of time.

When the user calls the provided temporary number the user may be identified based on the unique number assignment. The identification of the user enables the user interaction server to match the user with their website session and any user session data that was stored for that user session e.g. session of interaction s with a website . At this time the temporary number is released and available for re use with a different user. This allows the customer interaction to start in context and with relevant background information as the user has already been identified. In some embodiments the user can bypass the traditional IVR system if they have already performed self service prior to the voice call and the human call center agent has visibility into what the customer had been doing via the website. Additionally the prior knowledge of the details of the user activity via the website enables the telephone systems to make more intelligent choices regarding which agent should receive the user s call to ensure an optimal business outcome. Note that alternate embodiments include initiating a video session call e.g. over an Internet connection instead of a telephone call. Although a concrete example is described in detail in the context of a telephone call this should not be construed as limiting to a voice call only and is representative of establishing some form of communication channel between the user and a human agent.

In particular arrangement entails a customer or user navigating a website . Here website may be considered to comprise an interrelated group of World Wide Web pages usually constructed using hypertext markup language HTML code containing hyperlinks to each other and made available for access at corresponding uniform resource locator URL addresses via the Internet by an individual company educational institution government or organization. Website may be hosted via one or more web servers see e.g. element in which may include a display device one or more processors memory and one or more user input devices which may include a touch screen a keypad a microphone a keyboard a trackball a mouse and or any other known input device. The memory may comprise a non transitory data storage medium and may have stored thereon instructions for causing the processor s to execute a process for providing website to user . User may access website via a processing device such as a personal computer a smart phone e.g. IPHONE a smart pad e.g. IPAD a television a set top box a gaming console a kiosk a point of sale terminal an ATM etc. The processing device may include at least a processor and associated memory a display device for displaying the web pages of the website a user interface e.g. microphone with voice recognition software touch screen keyboard trackball mouse etc. for navigating the web pages of web site and a communication device for communication with the server s which host s website .

At some point during the user interaction with website an API call may be made via an API to a user interaction server at which point a unique user session ID may be assigned or established. User may continue to access and navigate website and user session data which may include for example tracking and monitoring information of the interactions of user with website is sent back to user interaction server and associated with a user session ID . This tracking and monitoring is more fully explained in below. Here user interaction server may include a display device one or more processor s memory and one or more user input devices which may include a touch screen a keypad a microphone a keyboard a trackball a mouse and or any other known input device. The memory may comprise a non transitory data storage medium and may have stored thereon instructions for causing the processor s to execute one or more functions or operations of user interaction server as described herein.

In still more detail referring still to at a certain point within the user session e.g. a session of interaction s with a website it is determined that an agent assisted service session should be initiated between user and a human agent.

In that case user is provided with one or more selected temporary agent access numbers e.g. one or more temporary telephone numbers in order to contact a human agent e.g. via placing a voice call and the one or more temporary agent access numbers may be displayed to user via website utilizing directly or indirectly a component . The selected agent access number s e.g. telephone number s is are received from the user interaction server as described below. Component may comprise a widget JAVA applet or other component of a web page of website which for example may include a piece of code embedded in the HTML code for the webpage.

In some embodiments user interaction server maintains a pool of agent access numbers e.g. telephone numbers .

In still more detail referring still to when an agent access number e.g. a telephone number is to be made available to user via website or another vehicle either 1 component or 2 website without component e.g. directly via API communicates with user interaction server and is provided with one or more selected temporary agent access number s from the pool of temporary agent access numbers. The obtained selected temporary agent access number s is are then displayed via website either via component or as a return value from API . The decision when to display the temporary agent access number s is based on any combination of using developer implemented logic tying into a telephony server to obtain CTI presence information such as making sure a human agent is actually available and using a rules engine. When user interaction server provides one or more selected temporary agent access number s from pool of temporary agent access numbers user interaction server also matches user session ID with the selected temporary agent access number s in order to connect or associate the voice session with the web session or user .

Still referring to there is shown how user then uses a telephone mobile or regular to place a telephone call to the displayed temporary telephone number which is now uniquely assigned to user . The call is typically received by an IVR system . Through an IVR component IVR system is able to recognize the dialed number as being a selected temporary agent access number . IVR component retrieves a unique user session ID and or user session data that is associated with selected temporary agent access number in a process . Usage of user session ID is optional and may allow the selected temporary agent access number to be recycled to the pool of temporary agent access numbers sooner. In configurations where no IVR system is present IVR component may have an alternate embodiment that allows it to be executed on a telephony system and utilize substantially the same workflow as described herein. In addition other embodiments include supporting Video and other calls . In such instances IVR system may be a voice response unit VRU using substantially the same mechanism as described herein. In general IVR system may include a display device one or more processor s memory and one or more user input devices which may include a touch screen a keypad a microphone a keyboard a trackball a mouse and or any other known input device. The memory may comprise a non transitory data storage medium and may have stored thereon instructions for causing the processor s to execute one or more functions or operations of IVR system as described herein.

Based on user session data e.g. tracking data and optionally applying rules IVR system can immediately place the inbound call in a defined call queue in telephony system at process and utilizing attached data or other protocol s associate attach the user session ID and or user session data which may include tracking data to the inbound call using IVRS component . In some embodiments user may not be presented with the typical IVR greeting in this case.

It should be understood that other embodiments include supporting video and other types of calls besides regular telephone calls. In such instances telephony system may comprise a media router or media server still using substantially the same mechanism as described herein.

Telephony system can provide an inbound call alert to the human agent screen pop providing user session ID and or user session data retrieved in process and attached during process . The agent desktop or screen pop component can use the same user session ID to retrieve additional detailed information about customer which were not passed in the attached user session data . When the temporary agent access number is no longer in use it may be recycled to the temporary agent access number pool .

It should be understood that utilizing a pool of temporary agent access numbers is not the exclusive manner for managing temporary agent access number or telephone numbers. Other embodiments may generate or select a temporary agent access number or telephone number based on some number generation algorithm.

Referring now to there is shown how an optional embedded component which displays the temporary access number may also be used to track user interactions with website in the application or on a device. User is illustrated interacting with website . Website is in turn typically interacting with a web or application server which hosts the web pages of website . The user interaction may involve multiple steps screens or processes with multiple roundtrips between website and web server . Some or all of these steps screens events or processes can be tracked by embedded component of website and included in user session data which may be stored in one or more memory devices of user interaction server .

Referring still to tracking component feeds the tracked information back to the user interaction server e.g. via user session data which maintains this tracked information for the user session on user interaction server and updates user session data which is optionally persisted to a permanent file store. Tracking component and temporary agent access number display component may be combined as a single component e.g. widget JAVA applet etc. in some embodiments. Tracking component has an application programming interface an example embodiment of which is detailed in . Some embodiments may omit tracking component and an API may be made available from user interaction server which may be invoked directly from website without the need for tracking component .

Referring now to there is shown a process whereby a user interacting with a website may optionally send user session data which may include tracking information to a user interaction server e.g. user interaction server and request a temporary agent access number e.g. a temporary telephone number .

In more detail still referring to there is shown that at some defined point within a web interaction session user session that certain information should be tracked. Examples include but are not limited to a user places an item in their online shopping cart or a user is viewing a high dollar item on an e commerce website s store. In some embodiments the website owner or developer may determine which events or actions are of importance to be tracked and may utilize an API to initiate tracking. In operation the API or component is invoked to establish a user session on the user interaction server with a unique session key or user ID.

In still more detail still referring to in operation a user may perform some action on the website. In operation it is determined whether the action is asking for an agent access number e.g. a telephone number to establish a communication channel e.g. a voice call or instead whether it is some other action clicking a hyperlink placing an item in the shopping basket clicking a button etc . In operation a decision is made whether this user interaction should be tracked logged and if it is to be logged then data representing the action is stored on the user interaction server and associated with the unique user session ID as depicted at operation .

In still more detail still referring to if a user requests an agent access number e.g. telephone number then a process is utilized see to display a temporary agent access number e.g. a temporary telephone number to the user for example via a component of a web page of a website. That temporary phone number is reserved for a period of time uniquely assigned with the user and is associated with the user session ID on the user interaction server as depicted in process . The temporary agent access number is then displayed to the user via the website and the customer may use that temporary agent access number to initiate a call to a human agent in operation . It should be specifically noted that additional heuristics may determine whether a temporary access number is in fact shown to the user. External factors can be utilized such as first ensuring that a human agent is available to take the call CTI Presence or that the customer is performing a transaction of sufficiently high value as to warrant accepting and processing an inbound call.

Referring now to there is shown a process whereby a temporary agent access number may be allocated from a pool of temporary agent access numbers. When a component on a website or mobile application or other device needs to present a telephone number to a user the component may make a request to the user interaction server as depicted in process . In operation the user interaction server may then attempt to obtain a free non used agent access number from the pool of temporary agent access numbers in addition to checking on optional external factors such as CTI presence and details of the user session. In operation a check is then made if a temporary agent access number was obtained or retrieved from pool of temporary agent access numbers. If no temporary agent access number has been obtained or retrieved then in operation the system can either fallback to a default agent access number or place the request into a retry queue and try some time later to obtain a temporary agent access number from the pool of temporary agent access numbers.

Referring still to there is shown in operation that once one or more temporary agent access numbers are obtained from the pool the obtained more temporary agent access number s is are marked as used or allocated so that it would be reserved for the required duration and not reused by another caller while still in use.

Referring still to there is shown an optional operation whereby a session is created on the user interaction server to establish a unique key e.g. user session ID associated with this temporary agent access number. In operation the temporary agent access number e.g. telephone number is then returned to the component for rendering or display.

Referring now to there is shown in more detail a component .

While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is considered presently to be the best mode thereof those of ordinary skill will understand and appreciate the existence of variations combinations and equivalents of the specific embodiment method and examples herein. The invention should therefore not be limited by the above described embodiment method and examples but by all embodiments and methods within the scope and spirit of the invention.

While preferred embodiments are disclosed herein many variations are possible which remain within the concept and scope of the invention. For example details of specific example embodiments have been described above wherein a user engages in a user session whereby the user interacts with a website prior to an agent assisted service session. However it should be understood that in other embodiments a user may instead engage in a user session whereby the user interacts with other types of information systems for example via a kiosk or a television set or a set top box prior to an agent assisted service session. In that case the user session data may comprises data gathered through those interactions rather than through website navigation and a selected temporary access number may be provided to the user via a user interface of that other type of information system. Such variations would become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art after inspection of the specification drawings and claims herein. The invention therefore is not to be restricted except within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
