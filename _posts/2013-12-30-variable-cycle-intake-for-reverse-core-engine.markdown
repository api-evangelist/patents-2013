This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 61 781 778 filed Mar. 14 2013.

The Government of the United States of America may have rights in the present invention as a result of NASA Cooperative Agreement Contract No. NNX11AB35A and Sub Contract No. MIT PW Subaward No. 5710002937 awarded by NASA.

The present disclosure is directed to a variable cycle intake for a propulsion system having a reverse core engine which variable cycle intake has a first position for supplying free stream air to an inlet of the engine and a second position for supplying fan stream air to the inlet of the engine.

Typical multi spool turbofan engines include a nested core in which a high pressure or core spool is nested inside a low pressure spool. Such a nested core engine includes in axial sequence a low pressure compressor a high pressure compressor a combustor section a high pressure turbine and a low pressure turbine. The high pressure compressor is connected to the high pressure turbine with a high pressure shaft that extends through the combustor section. The low pressure compressor is connected to the low pressure turbine with a low pressure shaft that extends through the high pressure shaft. Increases in efficiency of the turbofan allow for the core to be reduced in size such as by having a smaller diameter. The low pressure shaft however cannot be reduced in diameter because the rotational speeds of the low pressure spool are limited by critical speed. The shaft critical speed is proportional to the shaft diameter and inversely proportional to the shaft length. Thus decreasing the shaft diameter with reduced core sizes is not possible without reducing the shaft length if the same critical speed is desired. Thus reductions in the core size yields compromises in the high pressure spool to accommodate low pressure spool shaft diameters. For example the size and weight of high pressure spool rotor disk need to be increased to accommodate openings for larger low pressure shaft sizes. As such there is a need for improving engine architectures to allow for among other things decreased core sizes resulting from more efficient turbofan engines.

There has been proposed a gas turbine engine comprising a fan drive gear system a low spool connected to the fan drive gear system and a high spool disposed aft of the low spool. The low spool comprises a rearward flow low pressure compressor disposed aft of the fan drive gear systems and a forward flow low pressure turbine disposed aft of the low pressure compressor. The high spool comprises a forward flow high pressure turbine disposed aft of the low pressure turbine a combustor disposed of aft of the high pressure turbine and a forward flow high pressure compressor disposed aft of the combustor.

Other details of the variable cycle intake for reverse core engines are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.

Referring now to each of the propulsors may comprise a propulsor section which has a free turbine a fan having a plurality of fan blades which is driven by the free turbine and a plurality of fan exit guide vanes . The free turbine and the fan rotate about a central axis . Each of the propulsors further has a gas generator which has a longitudinal axis or central axis which is at an angle to the fan central axis .

The illustrated gas generator is a reverse core engine which includes a compressor section having one or more stages such as a low pressure compressor and a high pressure compressor a combustion section having one or more combustors and a turbine section having one or more stages such as a low pressure turbine and a high pressure turbine. The low pressure compressor in the gas generator is driven by a low pressure turbine via a low pressure spool and a high pressure compressor in the gas generator is driven by a high pressure turbine via a high pressure spool. The gas generator delivers combusted fluid to the free turbine for driving same via a plenum connected to the outlet of the gas generator . The free turbine drives the fan .

Referring now to there is shown a variable cycle air intake which is at least partially embedded within the aerodynamic fairing . As can be seen from the aerodynamic fairing has a leading edge a trailing edge an upper aerodynamic surface and a lower aerodynamic surface .

Referring now to the variable cycle intake has a duct system which includes a free stream air inlet a duct extending from the air inlet a slidable duct section which surrounds a portion of the duct and which moves relative to the duct a curved duct segment and an outlet duct section which connects to an inlet of a low pressure compressor section of the gas generator .

The curved duct segment overlaps and surrounds a portion of the outlet duct section . The curved duct segment is movable relative to the outlet duct section between a first position see and a second position see . In the first position the curved duct segment is in communication with the slidable duct section . In the second position see the curved duct segment is in communication with a fan stream air inlet duct .

As can be seen from the curved duct segment is rotated about an axis by a U shaped actuator . As shown in the U shaped actuator has a first arm connected to a first surface of the curved duct segment and a second arm connected to a second surface of the curved duct segment . The actuator may be rotated about the axis by a motor not shown or any other suitable power source.

An upper link is connected at a first end to the first surface of the curved duct segment . At a second end the upper link is connected to a first surface of the slidable duct section . As shown in a lower link is connected to at a first end to the second surface of the curved duct segment . At a second end the lower link is connected to a second surface of the slidable duct section .

Referring now to as the actuator rotates about the axis towards the air inlet the rotation of the actuator causes the slidable duct section to move from a first free stream air position to a second fan stream position. In the first free stream position the slidable duct section is in contact with the curved duct segment . In the second fan stream position the duct is out of contact with the curved duct segment .

When moving from the first position to the second position the slidable duct section moves relative to the duct by siding in a direction toward the air inlet and assume the position shown in and . As shown in movement of the slidable duct section creates a gap which allows the curved duct segment to rotate and come into fluid communication with the fan stream inlet duct . When the curved duct segment is in the position shown in fan stream air is supplied to the inlet of the gas generator .

When the actuator rotates about the axis away from the air inlet the rotation of the actuator causes the curved duct segment to rotate into the position shown in and causes the slidable duct section to slide over the duct and into the position shown in where the slidable duct section is in communication with the curved duct segment and the curved duct segment is out of contact with the fan stream inlet duct . In this position free stream air is provided to the inlet of the gas generator .

The variable cycle intake may include a particle separator see which separates solid particles from the free air stream. The particle separator may be provided with a first upstream outlet that communicates with an internal channel and a second downstream outlet in the external lower aerodynamic surface . Particles within the free air stream tend not to follow the curvature of the intake and continue on straight into the particle separator .

As shown in the aerodynamic fairing may be blended into a bi fi wall surrounding the core of the gas generator .

As shown in a cover plate may be provided within the fairing to cover the free stream air inlet when the variable cycle intake is in the fan stream air position. An actuator not shown may be provided to slide the cover plate over the air inlet .

There has been provided in accordance with the present disclosure a variable cycle intake for a reverse core engine. While the variable cycle intake has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof other unforeseen alternatives modifications and variations may become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly it is intended to embrace those alternatives modifications and variations which fall within the broad scope of the appended claims.
