The present invention is generally a system configured to give casino operators a way to host and manage mobile casino games for use by their players. The system is comprised of a player mobile device having mobile data communications capability and is connected to the mobile data network. A native mobile application downloaded to the mobile device which has access to the GPS interface among others. A collection of application content representing the casino s virtual gaming floor marketing etc. The application content containing navigation to the virtual casino floor and descriptions of each of the available games. Each game description containing a button used to launch the mobile game. Once the game launch button is pressed the native application queries the device GPS to collect the location information then creates a secure connection to the game server and passes the location and player authentication information to the game server and requests the game be launched. In the process of launching the game the game server queries the Network Operator on which the mobile device resides and receives the network s approximation on the geographical location of the mobile device. If the GPS and Network locations are equal within a predefined tolerance the game server launches the game and begins play. The mobile game queries the game server for starting credits and limitations which results in the game server contacting the player s wager account to verify credit and wager and then displays the balance information and the game begins. Each wager is again tagged with a GPS location and authentication as it is sent down to the game server. The game server queries the Network location and confirms the GPS checks the credit balance on the account rules and limitations and then executes the wager and returns the result to the game.

The game server then requests a player identification from the mobile communication device . An identity of the player is authenticated on the mobile communication device and sent to the game server . The game server then requests a player mobile identification from the mobile communication device . A player mobile identification is authenticated on the mobile communication device and sent to the game server . The game server then determines if the location is within an online gaming jurisdiction and if the player has sufficient credits in a loyalty account. The game server then transmits a user interface of the mobile game to the mobile communications device over the network. In playing the game as shown in an action of the player and a wager is packaged and transmitted from the mobile communication device to the game server . The game server confirms if there is sufficient credit for the wager at a CRM database of a loyalty site . The wager and associated game logic is executed at a game server in order to prevent fraud. An outcome is generated and returned to the mobile communication device and recorded at the CRM database of the loyalty site .

A system for managing a virtual casino game is shown in . The system provides for secure online gaming since a user interface is segmented from the game and secure on a game server which prevents tampering and fraud. Further since the game logic is secure on the game server auditing of the results is secure. As mentioned above an end user launches a native application on a mobile communication device for virtual casino game. The virtual casino game is one of a multiple virtual casino games on the native mobile application which can be accessed through a touch screen button . Each of the virtual casino games preferably comprises a button to launch the virtual casino game. A secure connection is created over a network between the mobile communication device and a game server preferably using a cryptographic protocol such as SSL secure sockets layer or TLS transport layer security .

The game server then requests a GPS location from the mobile communication device utilizing a GPS component of the mobile communication device which receives signals from GPS satellites . A GPS location for the mobile communication device is authenticated by a GPS component of the mobile communication device and sent to the game server . The game server also authenticates the location. The game server then requests a player identification from the mobile communication device . An identity of the player is authenticated on the mobile communication device and sent to the game server . The game server queries the mobile data network on which the mobile communication device operates for the geographical location of the mobile communication device . The mobile data network through the network location service utilizes triangulation nearest cell tower data or the like to provide an approximate geographical location of the mobile communication device . The mobile data network transmits the approximate geographical location of the mobile device to game server . The game server then determines if the geographical location provided by the native application on the mobile communication device is within a predefined boundary of the approximate geographical location of the mobile communication device provided by the mobile data network .

The game server then determines if the location is within an online gaming jurisdiction and if the player has sufficient credits in a loyalty account. The game server then transmits a user interface of the mobile game to the mobile communications device over the network. By maintaining the game logic on the server the virtual casino is managed by the loyalty site preventing fraud and allowing for proper audits of the results. Thus the end user sends transmissions from the mobile communication device to the game server in order to play the game which is conducted on the game server not the mobile communication device . Although it appears to the end user that the casino game of the virtual casino application resident on the mobile communication device allows the casino game to be played on the mobile communication device the game logic of the casino game is run at the game server .
