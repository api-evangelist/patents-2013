To ensure the security of any involved host device s e.g. user device s and or peripheral device s various management and or security capabilities may be provided according to example embodiments. For example responsive actions may be centrally managed defined and or controlled such as via a compliance server or the like. According to other example embodiments an authorization procedure may be performed prior to causing the at least one responsive action to be performed. The authorization procedure may for example involve authenticating the host device s e.g. user device s and or peripheral device s and or determining whether causing a given responsive action to be performed is authorized e.g. by one or more compliance rules.

Having thus provided an overview of features and or functionality which may be provided according to some example embodiments attention will now be turned to the Figures so that certain example embodiments may be described in more detail.

The host device s e.g. user device s may comprise any device s configured to communicate over one or more networks such as the network depicted in . For example the host device may comprise a user device such as a mobile telephone smartphone tablet computer PDA pager desktop or laptop computer a set top box a music player a game console or any of numerous other fixed or portable communication devices computation devices content generation devices content consumption devices or combinations thereof.

The peripheral device s may comprise any electronic devices that are accessible to and or controllable by but are not an essential component of at least one host electronic device s such as the user device s . For example the peripheral device s may comprise a printer scanner mouse keyboard external hard drive sensor camera speaker system vehicle home office automation system cloud computing system security system payment processing point of sale system or any number of other electronic devices or combinations thereof. It will be understood that with respect to any given host device or peripheral device any other host device s and peripheral device s that is any host device s and or peripheral device s besides the host device or peripheral device may be considered peripheral device s .

The resource server may for example comprise any type of network accessible electronic device or system that includes storage such as the depicted resource store . The resource server may according to one example embodiment comprise a public server that may be accessible to anyone who connects to it over a network such as the network . According to another example embodiment the resource server may require user registration and or may require use of an authorized user device to access it. The resource server may store any type of data such as various types of content support software e.g. drivers for the one or more peripheral devices applications and or any other data.

The compliance server may be any type of network accessible electronic device or system that includes storage such as the depicted compliance rule store and may be configured to communicate with the host device s e.g. user device s and or the peripheral device s over one or more networks such as the network depicted in to provide device management capabilities. For example the compliance server may comprise cloud based solutions server computers and or any other system providing device management capability. For purposes of convenience the compliance server is referred to herein in the singular although it will be understood that a plurality of servers may be employed in the arrangements as descried herein. Furthermore in some embodiments multiple compliance servers may operate on the same server computer. The components executed on the compliance server for example may comprise various applications services processes systems engines or functionality not disclosed in detail herein.

The compliance server may comprise a management application and a compliance rule store storing one or more compliance rules e.g. compliance policies that may be applicable to the host device s e.g. user device s and or the peripheral device s . While the management application is shown as within the compliance server the management application may additionally or alternately be within the user device s the peripheral device s and or remotely located on the resource server and may be remotely updated such as periodically via compliance server according to any number of suitable over the air OTA updating methods.

Attempts by the host device s e.g. user device s to perform certain functionality such as accessing a peripheral device directly or via the network performing a responsive action or the like may require the host device to be in compliance with one or more of the compliance rules. Depending on the sensitivity and or nature of a given functionality different compliance rules may be necessary to ensure that the functionality is adequately restricted. Some functionality may only require ensuring that the proper user is requesting the functionality. Other resources may require compliance with more stringent authorization rules such as determining whether the functionality is restricted during certain time windows or geographic areas. Accordingly the host device s e.g. user device s and or the compliance server may be operative to determine whether the user of the host device is authorized to perform requested functionality at the time the user requests to perform such functionality.

Compliance server may for example use the compliance rules to impose hardware restrictions regarding the use of specific devices and or specific device features such as for instance cameras Bluetooth IRDA tethering external storage a mobile access point and or other hardware restrictions. The compliance rules may additionally or alternatively impose software restrictions such as the use of specific wireless device operating systems or applications internet browser restrictions screen capture functionality and or other software restrictions. Mobile device management restrictions may additionally or alternatively be included in the compliance rules and may comprise encryption requirements firmware versions remote lock and wipe functionalities logging and reporting features GPS tracking and or other mobile device management features.

The compliance server may determine whether one or more device characteristics of a requesting device e.g. a host device such as the user device s satisfy one or more of the restrictions enumerated in the compliance rules. For example the compliance server may determine that a requesting device that has a camera Bluetooth capability and is executing a specified version of an operating system is compliant with the compliance rules. As another example the compliance server may determine that a requesting device that is associated with an external storage unit and has screen capture functionality enabled is not compliant with the compliance rules.

In some embodiments an agent application executed on the host device s e.g. user device s may make the compliance determination based on a device profile e.g. the device profile depicted in credentials and or user preferences. For instance the agent application may monitor calls by applications such as the web browser email client secure application and or any other application on the host device to an operating system e.g. the operating system depicted in of the host device to determine whether user device s seeks to perform functionality associated with one and or more of the compliance rules described above such as accessing the one or more peripheral device s performing a responsive action or the like. Additionally the agent application executed on the host device s e.g. user device s may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests. For instance the agent application may instruct the operating system on the host device s e.g. user device s to prevent the device from performing a responsive action in response to a determination that a compliance rule e.g. one or more of the compliance rules stored in the data store depicted in specifies that such a responsive is not authorized.

In some embodiments the agent application executed on the host device s e.g. user device s may rely on the compliance server to determine whether a given functionality of the device such as causing a responsive action to be performed is authorized according to the compliance rules. For instance the agent application may transmit information such as a device profile credentials user data information regarding one or more peripheral devices and or information regarding one or more responsive actions to the compliance server so that compliance server may determine whether the host device e.g. user device seeks to perform functionality that may violate a given compliance rule. Additionally the compliance server may approve and or deny the associated functionality requests. For instance the compliance server may instruct the agent application on the host device e.g. user device s to instruct the operating system on the host device to cause or allow a responsive action to be performed. In other cases the compliance server might instruct the agent application to not allow a responsive action to be performed or even to cause or allow a modified or alternative responsive action to be performed depending on applicable compliance rules.

In some embodiments the compliance rules may comprise device settings and or executable instructions that define which functionality the operating system of the host device s e.g. user device s is authorized to perform. Furthermore the compliance rules may comprise a list of functions such as those provided by APIs associated with the operating system and or a platform library such as the platform library depicted in that may be treated as protected functions. Responsive actions may for example comprise or otherwise be associated with one or more of these functions. Calls to these functions such as calls to retrieve login credentials or attempts to perform a responsive action may result in checks by the host device e.g. via the agent application and or the compliance server e.g. via the management application for compliance with the compliance rules.

In some embodiments the agent application may perform a set of ordered operations to accomplish a requested function. These operation sets may be defined on e.g. stored in a memory of the host device e.g. user device s and or the compliance server and may comprise one or more operations to determine whether the host device is in compliance with compliance rules from the compliance rule store . The agent application may control at least one respective computing resource of the host device s . The operations may include configuring at least one respective computing resource of the host device s such as restricting access to at least one resource managed by the agent application .

As shown in the host device s e.g. user device s peripheral device s compliance server and or resource server may communicate with one another directly and or via the network . The host device s peripheral device s compliance server and or resource server may connect to the network via wired or wireless means such as via one or more intermediate networks. For example the host device s peripheral device s compliance server and or resource server may connect with the network via wired means such as Ethernet USB Universal Serial Bus or the like or via wireless means such as for example WI FI BLUETOOTH or the like or by connecting with a wireless cellular network such as a Long Term Evolution LTE network an LTE Advanced LTE A network a Global Systems for Mobile communications GSM network a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA network e.g. a Wideband CDMA WCDMA network a CDMA2000 network or the like a General Packet Radio Service GPRS network or other type of network.

Accordingly the Network may comprise for example one or more wired and or wireless networks such as one or more wireless local area networks WLAN wireless wide area networks WWAN Ethernet networks fiber optic networks and or any other type of wired and or wireless network now known or later developed. Additionally the Network may comprise the Internet and or one or more intranets extranets microwave networks satellite communications networks cellular networks infrared communication networks global area networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of such networks.

As discussed below the operations of may be performed by one or more apparatuses such as the apparatus depicted in embodied by or otherwise associated with one or more of the host devices e.g. user device s peripheral device s compliance server and or resource server depicted in so as to facilitate peripheral device management.

In this regard and turning first to the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the peripheral device and or the compliance server may include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for receiving at least one request to access at least one peripheral device . See operation . Such at least one request may for example be received from one or more of the host devices e.g. user devices . According to another example embodiment the request may additionally or alternatively be received from the at least one peripheral device . That is the peripheral device may for example receive a request from the host device and may in response route this request or transmit a new corresponding request to the compliance server .

Regardless of its origin and or destination the request may according to an example embodiment include information regarding the device requesting to access the at least on peripheral device e.g. information regarding the one or more host devices e.g. user devices from which the request was received.

According to another example embodiment the request to access the at least one peripheral device by the at least one host device e.g. user device may additionally or alternatively include information regarding one or more services to be provided by the at least one peripheral device . For example a request to access a printer may include information about a print job such as whether the print job is in color and or how many pages it includes. A request to access a vehicle may include information regarding load weight and or a distance to be traveled. According to yet another example embodiment the request to access the at least one peripheral device by the host device e.g. user device may comprise a generalized request. That is the request may for example not request any particular peripheral device but instead comprise a general request such as a request for a particular type of peripheral device e.g. printer vehicle etc. . The determination of whether to grant such a generalized request may therefore comprise as will be discussed in greater detail below a determination of what peripheral device is to serve the request if it is granted.

According to an example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server and or the at least one peripheral device may further comprise means such as those discussed above for receiving information regarding the at least one peripheral device. See operation . The information regarding the at least one peripheral device may for example comprise status information.

According to a further embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server and or peripheral device may include means such as those discussed above for determining at least one peripheral device optimization scheme based at least in part on the information regarding the at least one peripheral device such as the usage information. The at least one optimization scheme may for example comprise one or more optimization suggestions such as one or more procurement suggestion e.g. one or more suggestions to purchase and or add one or more additional peripheral devices such as one or more peripheral devices of a specific type or that are configured to provide one or more particular services one or more location suggestions e.g. one or more suggestions regarding where to locate one or more peripheral devices and or one or more disposal suggestions e.g. one or more suggestions to remove and or dispose of one or more peripheral devices such as peripheral devices determined to be unnecessary or redundant based on the usage information.

The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the peripheral device and or the compliance server may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for determining whether to grant the request to access the at least one peripheral device. See operation . The apparatus may for example make this determination based at least in part on the information regarding the host device e.g. user device requesting the access and at least one compliance rule. Thus for example a compliance rule may provided that only members of one or more particular policy groups are permitted to access one or more particular peripheral devices. The request to access at least one of the particular peripheral devices may thus comprise information regarding the requesting host device e.g. user device such as a device or user ID such that a policy group for the host device may be determined and based on this policy group and the compliance rule defining allowed policy groups a determination may be made as to whether the requested access to the at least one particular peripheral device by the requesting host device should be granted.

According to another example embodiment the at least one compliance rule may comprise at least one geographic condition.

According to another example embodiment the at least one compliance rule may for example comprise at least one temporal condition such that for example the at least one compliance rule provides that access to one or more particular peripheral devices is limited to one or more particular periods of time or that such access once initially granted is limited to a particular duration.

Further examples of compliance rules may include rules directed to host device e.g. user device hardware and or software configurations so as to for example ensure only host devices that are compatible with a particular peripheral device are granted access thereto. Compliance rules may additionally or alternatively comprise rules directed to limiting access to peripheral devices by host devices that are not in compliance with various security configuration and or usage policies. As but one example the at least one compliance rule may provide that compromised e.g. jailbroken or rooted devices are denied access to one or more peripheral devices. An unlimited number of other configuration rules may additionally or alternatively be provided according to other example embodiments the scope of the present invention not being limited by the examples being explicitly provided herein.

The determination of whether to grant the request may additionally or alternatively be based at least in part on the information regarding the at least one peripheral device that may be received as discussed above. For example the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server and or the at least one peripheral device may include means such as those discussed above for determining based at least in part on received status or usage information whether the at least one peripheral device would be capable of serving the at least one host device. As discussed above the request to access the at least one peripheral device by the host device s e.g. user device may include information regarding a nature of one or more desired services. Accordingly the determination of whether the at least one peripheral device would be capable of serving the at least one user device may be further based on this information. For example a request to access a printer for the purpose of serving a two hundred page printing request may be denied if for example the operational status information regarding the printer indicates there is only enough ink for twenty pages. Similarly a request to access a vehicle for the purpose of making a delivery 1000 miles away may be denied if for example the operational status information regarding the vehicle indicates an oil change or another type of service is due in 25 miles.

As discussed above the request to access the at least one peripheral device may according to some example embodiments comprise a generalized request. For example such a generalized request may comprise a request to access a particular class or type of peripheral device as opposed to one or more particular peripheral devices. Accordingly determining whether to grant the request may according to an example embodiment additionally or alternatively comprise determining based at least in part on the generalized request one or more particular peripheral devices for handling the generalized request. Such a determination may for example be based at least in part on any of the received information regarding the requesting host device as discussed above such as a location of the host device. For example a peripheral device may be determined based at lest in part on how close in proximity it is to the requesting host device. The determination may additionally or alternatively for example be based at least in part on the at least one compliance rule. That is a particular peripheral device may be determined based at least in part on whether access to the particular peripheral device by the host device would be allowed according to the at least one compliance rule.

According to another example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the peripheral device and or the compliance server may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for causing access to the at least one peripheral device by the host device s e.g. user device to be facilitated in an instance in which it is determined to grant the request to access the at least one peripheral device. See operation . Causing access to the at least one peripheral device may for example comprise causing software such as one or more device drivers or the like corresponding to the at least one peripheral device to be installed on the host device. According to another example embodiment causing access to the at least one peripheral device may for example comprise causing the at least one peripheral device to permit access by the host device or causing a connection to be established between the at least one peripheral device and the host device. Causing access to the at least one peripheral device may in some embodiments be facilitated by processing logging and or negotiating access charge payments associated with the at least one peripheral device . Causing access to the at least one peripheral device may in some embodiments be facilitated by relaying functional commands between the at least one peripheral device and the user device such as through the compliance server .

According to another example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the peripheral device and or the compliance server may further include means such as the processor the memory the communication interface and or the like for causing access to at least one alternative peripheral device by the user device to be facilitated in an instance in which it is determined not to grant the request to access the at least one peripheral device. See operation . For example the apparatus may cause access to at least one alternative peripheral device to be facilitated in an instance in which it is determined that a compliance rule prevents the host device s e.g. user device from accessing the requested peripheral device . According to another example the apparatus may cause access to at least on alternative peripheral device to be facilitated in an instance in which it is determined e.g. based at least in part on operational status information not to grant the request. For example such alternate access may be facilitated in an instance in which the operational status information indicates that the at least one peripheral device to which the host device requested access is malfunctioning low on resources in use being serviced etc.

Having thus described various functionality that may be provided in association with a compliance server and or at least one peripheral device attention will be turned to to discuss corresponding functionality that may be provided in association with a host device such as the user device .

For example a user may select such as via a user interface of the host device an option to print a document backup a file access a vehicle or security door or the like. As another example receiving the indication of at least one service may comprise receiving an indication from a peripheral device configured to provide the at least one service. For example the apparatus may receive a signal indicating one or more available services from one or more peripheral device upon moving in proximity to e.g. in communication range of the one or more peripheral devices .

According to another example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device e.g. user device may include means such as the at least one processor the at least one memory the communication interface and or the like for determining at least one suitable peripheral device e.g. at least one peripheral device configured to provide the at least one service.

For example the apparatus may consult a file database or the like including one or more associations e.g. mappings between one or more services and one or more suitable peripheral devices. According to another example embodiment the at least one peripheral device may be selected e.g. by a user via the user interface . The determination of the at least one suitable peripheral device may additionally or alternatively be based at least in part on information regarding the desired service. The information regarding the desired service may for example comprise more factors and or parameters relating to the desired service such as one or more user preferences regarding the service one or more requirements for optimal provision of the service or the like.

According to another example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device e.g. user device may include means such as those discussed above for causing the above described request to access at least one peripheral device to be generated and or transmitted. See operation . The features and or contents of the request may be in accordance with the description provided above. The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device may cause the request to be generated and or transmitted automatically such as in response to receiving an indication that the user device is in proximity to the at least one peripheral device to which the request pertains. For example a user may approach at least one peripheral device for which physical proximity thereto may have a tendency to indicate a desire or need to access the at least one peripheral device and the user s device may automatically generate an appropriate corresponding request to access the peripheral device. Non limiting examples of peripheral devices for which this behavior may be beneficial that is peripheral devices for which physical proximity may be indicative of a desire or need for access thereto may include vehicles security systems home and or office automation systems scanners fax machines copiers or the like or any other such peripheral devices where accessing a provided service of the peripheral device may either require or be facilitated by user proximity and or direct user interaction.

The determination of the at least one suitable peripheral device may additionally or alternatively be based at least in part on information regarding the at least one peripheral device. The information regarding the at least one peripheral device may for example comprise a proximity to the at least one peripheral device operational status information regarding the at least one peripheral device as will be discussed further below at least one capability of the at least one peripheral device such as continuing with the printer example whether the printer prints in black and white and or color authorization information e.g. which if any of the one or more peripheral devices the user is authorized or is likely to be authorized to access and or usage information such as whether the at least one peripheral device is currently being accessed e.g. used or a number of queued requests to access the peripheral device.

According to an example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device e.g. user device may include means such as those discussed above for accessing at least one peripheral device .

As discussed above the at least one peripheral device accessed by the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device may be the requested peripheral device a peripheral device determined by the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the compliance server or one or more peripheral devices based on a generalized request or an alternative peripheral device such as in an instance in which a request is denied.

According to another example embodiment the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device e.g. user device may include means such as those discussed above for causing information regarding the at least one peripheral device to be transmitted. See operations . The apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device may for example gather various information regarding the at least one peripheral device such as any or all of the information discussed above and may cause this information to be transmitted such as to the compliance server . This information may for example be gathered following accessing the peripheral device or according to another example embodiment may be gathered in an instance in which the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device is in communication range of the at least one peripheral device. Thus for example host devices e.g. user devices may gather information from various peripheral devices as their users carry them into proximity of the peripheral devices. In this way inspections of peripheral devices by support personnel may be supplemented or even rendered unnecessary as user devices may be used to automatically gather and transmit information regarding such peripherals .

Referring now to various operations of some example embodiments of the present invention are depicted. As discussed below the operations of may be performed by one or more apparatuses such as the apparatus depicted in embodied by or otherwise associated with one or more host devices e.g. user device s peripheral device s compliance server and or resource server depicted in so as to provide for autonomous device interaction.

In this regard and turning first to the apparatus embodied by or otherwise associated with the host device e.g. user device and or peripheral device may include means such as the at least one processor the at least one memory the communication interface the user interface and or the like for receiving response configuration information. See operation . At least a portion of the response configuration information may according to some example embodiments be received from the compliance server . According to other example embodiments at least a portion of the response configuration information may be received from one or more other sources such as a device manufacturer e.g. the host device and or peripheral device may be sold pre configured with response configuration information a software provider e.g. response configuration information may be provided during installation of one or more applications utilities drivers or the like a user e.g. a user of the host device and or peripheral device may create modify or otherwise define at least a portion of the response configuration information or any other source either local or remote to the host device and or peripheral device . For example the host device may according to some example embodiments receive at least a portion of the response configuration information from one or more peripheral devices and or the peripheral device may receive at least a portion of the response configuration information from one or more host devices.

The response configuration information may for example include information relating one or more peripheral devices to one or more responsive actions. Thus for example the response configuration information may include a list of peripheral device identifiers such as identifiers of one or more peripheral devices e.g. identifiers of individual peripheral devices categories or groups of peripheral devices or the like along with one or more responsive actions associated with the identifiers. Examples of identifiers of individual peripheral devices may include identifiers such as network addresses media access control MAC addresses serial numbers or any other identifiers suitable for identifying individual peripheral devices. Examples of identifiers of categories or groups of peripheral devices may include identifiers of for example functionality provided by one or more peripheral devices classes or classifications of one or more peripheral devices model numbers of one or more peripheral devices or any other identifier suitable for identifying categories or groups of peripheral device.

According to some example embodiments the response configuration information may additionally or alternatively include a variety of context data. The context data may for example include information regarding the triggering event. According to some example embodiments the context data may additionally or alternatively include environmental information such as a date and or time weather or the like. Such context data may for example include device information such as any information included in the device profile depicted in and discussed above.

Indeed example embodiments may define these relationships using various general or special purpose programming and or scripting languages. For instance various programming and or scripting languages providing object oriented programming capabilities may be used thereby providing the capability to encapsulate various peripheral device and or host device properties and or functionality in corresponding objects. Thus an example of response configuration might include a relationship defined thusly 

for peripheral device X if user device.policygroup peripheral device X.policy group then peripheral device X.responsive action Y wait 20 user device.responsive action Z .

It will be understood that the foregoing examples are merely illustrative pseudo code and that embodiments within the scope of the present invention may use any special or general purpose language and or syntax to define these relationships between one or more peripheral devices context data and one or more responsive actions.

Accordingly the response configuration information may within the framework discussed above define anything from simple relationships such as specifying that host devices e.g. user devices are to automatically download and install a particular driver when they come in in proximity of peripheral device B to more complex relationships such as specifying that host devices e.g. user devices belonging to policy group X that are in proximity of a vehicle system computer are to receive and re transmit status information from the computer if the vehicle has returned from its last delivery of the month or the status information indicates that maintenance is needed for the vehicle. The response configuration information might also define relationships very broadly such as specifying that a particular class of peripheral devices in a home or office are to power down when no more user devices are in proximity to any of the peripheral devices in the particular class or very narrowly such as specifying that a specific peripheral device is to power on when a user device associated with a particular user is in proximity to the specific peripheral device.

The vehicle computer system may then receive information regarding one or more user devices in proximity e.g. within the cabin and cause a responsive action such as disabling various functionality of the one or more user devices to be performed. For example in the case of an aircraft computer system the responsive action may comprise forcing the one or more user devices into an airplane mode or similar state in which wireless transmission reception functionality is deactivated. Similarly in the example of a vehicle computer system the responsive action may comprise disabling text message and or data functionality or the like.
