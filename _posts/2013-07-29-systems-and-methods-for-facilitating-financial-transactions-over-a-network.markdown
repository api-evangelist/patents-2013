The present invention generally relates to financial transactions and more particularly to facilitating financial transactions over a network.

In online financial transactions customers search for and purchase products and services through electronic communications with online merchants over electronic networks such as the Internet. During the course of these transactions customers may provide payment in various ways including for example credit cards electronic fund transfers and other payment techniques offered by payment providers.

Typically when online shopping at a particular website customers select items to purchase by clicking on a link for a specific item. The selected items are placed on reserve in some type of virtual shopping cart. When done shopping the customer proceeds to a checkout page to provide some form of payment for the selected items. At this point in the process the customer provides some form of identification and payment. When the customer continues shopping and is ready to purchase items from another website the customer is typically prompted to re enter some form of identification and payment.

This process can be tedious and inconvenient. Entering information every time an online transaction takes place is inefficient and time consuming. Thus there currently exists a need to improve the process of purchasing products and services in online transactions.

In accordance with embodiments of the invention systems and methods for facilitating financial transactions over a network include a merchant device a client device and a payment processing device. The merchant device is adapted to allow a merchant to provide one or more items for purchase via the network. The client device includes a browser application adapted to allow a user to access the merchant device via the network and view the one or more items for purchase. The client device includes a service application adapted to provide a payment mechanism to the user. The user generates a purchase request for at least one item by selecting the at least one item dragging the at least one item to the payment mechanism and dropping the at least one item over the payment mechanism. The payment processing device is adapted to receive the purchase request from the client device via the network and authorize the user to purchase the at least one item from the merchant based on information passed with the purchase request.

In accordance with embodiments of the invention the merchant device may be adapted to allow a merchant to generate a bill image summarizing the one or more items selected for purchase. The client device may be adapted to allow the user to generate a purchase request for at least one item by selecting the at least one item instructing the merchant device to generate the bill image summarizing purchase of the at least one item selected for purchase dragging the bill image to the payment mechanism and dropping the bill image over the payment mechanism. The payment processing device is adapted to receive the purchase request including information related to the bill image from the client device via the network and authorize the user to purchase the at least one item from the merchant based on information passed with the purchase request.

In accordance with embodiments of the invention systems and methods for facilitating financial transactions over a network include a first component adapted to communicate with a user via a client device over the network and a merchant via a merchant device over a network and a second component adapted to receive a purchase request from the user via the client device over the network and authorize the user to purchase at least one item from the merchant based on information passed with the purchase request. The second component provides a service application to the user as a payment mechanism and the service application allows the user to generate the purchase request for the at least one item by selecting the at least one item from the merchant device dragging the at least one item to the payment mechanism and dropping the at least one item over the payment mechanism.

In accordance with embodiments of the invention systems and methods for facilitating financial transactions over a network include receiving a purchase request for a selected item from a user via the network. The purchase request includes user information merchant information and selected item information embedded as arguments in an expression. The systems and methods include verifying the user information including accessing a user account based on the user information to verify the availability of monetary funds for the selected item and verifying the merchant information including accessing a merchant account based on the merchant information and availability of the selected item related to the selected item information. The systems and methods include processing the purchase request by authorizing the user to purchase the selected item from the merchant based on the verified user and merchant information and completing the purchase request by deducting monetary funds from the user account and crediting the deducted monetary funds to the merchant account.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the invention and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Embodiments of the present disclosure enable users to drag and drop an image e.g. icon of an item e.g. product or service for purchase displayed in a graphical user interface GUI such as a web browser to a payment mechanism such as a desktop image or icon and or a toolbar. When enabled the payment mechanism recognizes the selected item and communicates with a payment processing provider to purchase the selected item. In one implementation the payment processing provider may redirect the user to a page on a merchant site that confirms their purchase of the selected product. The payment mechanism may also take different actions such as adding the product to a virtual shopping cart and providing buttons to complete the purchase at a later time. In various embodiments the payment mechanism may be implemented with a browser plug in bundled with an existing toolbar or application or a provided in a frames based implementation that may not require the user to download an application.

In some implementations the image on the web page representing an item for purchase may include an image attribute having dynamic arguments identifying the item for purchase as information in a bill or invoice. When enabled the payment mechanism may transmit a bill or invoice identifier along with a user identifier and or a merchant identifier to the payment processing provider for payment processing of the purchase. After payment processing is completed the payment processing provider may inform the merchant of the processing result which may include a successful payment. In another implementation the bill or invoice image may be dragged by the user to any of a plurality of payment provider images or icons e.g. Visa MC AmEx PayPal . Therefore it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present disclosure may extend beyond a browser application to other applications that enable dragging and dropping of objects while retaining information associated with the objects.

Embodiments of the present disclosure overcome deficiencies of conventional approaches to processing online financial transactions wherein the merchant manages a cash register and or point of sale POS device and receives credit card information from a client or user. Instead embodiments of the present disclosure enable a merchant to manage the cash register e.g. a user s shopping cart and the payment processing provider manages the POS device and the user s credit card and or banking information. Thus the merchant transmits bill or invoice information to the payment processing provider which handles the payment processing and reports back results thereof such as success or failure thereby simplifying the merchant s involvement with the payment transaction.
