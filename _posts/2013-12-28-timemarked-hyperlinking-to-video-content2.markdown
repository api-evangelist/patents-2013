This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 412 112 filed Mar. 26 2009 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

A first user may direct a second user to a video over the Internet by communicating to the second user a hyperlink to the video. The first user may communicate the hyperlink to the second user for example by e mail or instant message IM or by inserting it into a web page or document accessible to the second user. The second user may click on or otherwise select the hyperlink or an element such as hypertext or a graphical element embedding the hyperlink and a web browser such as GOOGLE CHROME of the second user may fetch a web page such as a web page of the domain YOUTUBE.COM that the hyperlink points to. The web page may contain a video player that automatically or in response to input from the second user such as the second user clicking on or otherwise selecting the video player in the web page starts playing the video from the beginning of video.

In one embodiment a method includes receiving from a first user interface a first input from a first user specifying a first particular instant in a video other than a beginning of the video in response to the first input generating by one or more computer systems first data for inclusion in a link to the video the first data representing the first particular instant in the video and being operable automatically to direct playback of the video at a second user interface to start at the first particular instant in the video in response to a second user selecting the link at the second user interface and communicating the first data to a link generator for inclusion in the link to the video.

In particular embodiments a client may enable a user at client to access content via one or more servers and enable the user to communicate with one or more other users at one or more other clients . Reference to a client may encompass a user at client and vice versa where appropriate. A client may be a computer system such as a desktop or notebook computer system a personal digital assistant PDA or a mobile telephone or other suitable client . A client may include one or more clients . A client may receive input from and communicate output to a user at client . As examples and not by way of limitation client may receive input from the user by way of a keyboard mouse or touch screen and communicate output to the user by way of a display. Clients need not be the same throughout system . One or more first clients may differ from one or more second clients . The present disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable clients .

A client may have a web browser such as GOOGLE CHROME. A user at client may click on or otherwise select a hyperlink or an element such as hypertext or a graphical element embedding the hyperlink in an e mail an IM a web page or a document and a Uniform Resource Locator URL or other address in the hyperlink may direct the web browser to a particular server which may be web servers . The hyperlink may include other information in addition to a URL or other address. The web browser may generate a Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP request and communicate the HTTP request to server . Server may accept the HTTP request and communicate to client one or more Hyper Text Markup Language HTML files responsive to the HTTP request. Client may render a web page from the HTML files from server for presentation to the user. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable web page files. As an example and not by way of limitation web pages may render from HTML files Extensible HyperText Markup Language XHTML files or Extensible Markup Language XML files according to particular needs. Such pages may also execute scripts such as by way of example and not by way of limitation those written in JAVASCRIPT JAVA MICROSOFT SILVERLIGHT combinations of markup language and scripts such as AJAX Asynchronous JAVASCRIPT and XML and the like. Herein reference to a web page encompasses one or more corresponding web page files which a browser may use to render the web page and vice versa where appropriate.

The present disclosure contemplates any suitable web pages. As an example and not by way of limitation a web page hosted by a server may be static or dynamic. In particular embodiments multiple web pages stored together in a common directory at a server make up a website or a portion of a website. In particular embodiments a web page includes one or more elements. As an example and not by way of limitation presented or rendered elements of a web page may include static text static images animated images audio video interactive text interactive illustrations buttons hyperlinks or forms. Such elements may each occupy a particular space on the web page when displayed. Internal or hidden elements of a web page may include for example and not by way of limitation comments meta elements databases diagramation and style information and scripts such as JAVASCRIPT. One or more elements of a web page may be inline frames IFrames which enable web developers to embed HTML documents into other HTML documents. Herein reference to a document may encompass a web page where appropriate. Reference to an element of a web page may encompass one or more portions of a web page file for rendering the element and vice versa where appropriate.

A server may be a web or other server providing access to content . Content may reside at one or more databases accessible to one or more servers . Herein reference to content encompasses audio static images video web pages and other content where appropriate. A server may be unitary or distributed spanning multiple computer systems or multiple datacenters. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable servers . A server may include one or more servers . In particular embodiments one or more servers each include one or more servers or other computer systems for hosting web pages or particular elements of web pages. As described above a server may host HTML files or other file types or may dynamically create or constitute files upon a request and communicate them to clients in response to HTTP or other requests from clients . In particular embodiments a web browser at a client may render a web page from one or more HTML files received from one or more servers . In particular embodiments a server may render a web page and then serve the rendered web page to a client for display. When a web page renders the browser or the server rendering the web page may retrieve one or more elements of the web page from one or more servers providing access to particular content . As an example multiple servers operated by a single publisher may host elements of web pages of the publisher. For example the publisher may operate one or more first servers for video one or more second servers for text one or more third servers for images and one or more fourth servers for advertisements. Servers operated by the publisher may serve the domain of the publisher. When a web browser at a client renders a web page the web browser may retrieve and load one or more elements of the web page from one or more servers as directed by one or more HTML or other files for rendering the web page. The web browser may retrieve and load one or more video files in the web page from one or more databases containing video.

It may be difficult to integrate output from ASR service with video playback to display all the details provided by the speech recognizer in a useable way. Often a transcript lacks punctuation or contains errors making it hard to read. However the transcript may still improve the video browsing experience. Particular embodiments apply the concept of a snippet to spoken content making snippets with bolded hit terms available. As with text snippets users will most likely only skim them so a rough transcript will suffice in most cases. For a more detailed overview particular embodiments may return the ten or other suitable number of best snippets selected primarily on the number of token hits in the snippet and the confidence scores associated with those hits.

To facilitate faster video navigation the snippets may index into the video and provide points to start playback at their occurrences. In particular embodiments user interface implements this through custom JAVASCRIPT controls of a YOUTUBE video player enabling any element on the page seek to arbitrary points in the video. In user interface integrates snippets to player controls which may reduce the amount of space needed to display user interface placing markers on playbar at the start time of each snippet . A user may interact with playbar by clicking on or otherwise selecting a particular location along playbar or moving slider to a particular location along playbar . Clicking on a marker corresponding to a snippet may initiate playback two seconds before the start time of a first word in snippet . This offset may reduce the chance of missing audio that should be in snippet but is not possibly due to timing imprecision or seeking irregularities. Markers may be yellow or another suitably conspicuous color against playbar and may provide a good one glance overview of the frequency of the query terms in the video. Because markers correspond to relevant video sections markers may provide a high level overview of token hits.

In particular embodiments playbar is a logical point of integration of text to video timing but may be less than ideal due to the combination of small playbar size and dense transcript information. Especially for longer videos a pixel in playbar may encompass ten or even more seconds which may cause some markers to overlap with each other taking away from mouseover and browsing interaction with user interface . Particular embodiments merge overlapping markers with each other. Particular embodiments may show only one of two or more overlapping snippets and recalculate overlaps if the player is resized. In user interface utilizes space beneath the video player to provide immediate access to all snippets . In particular embodiments audio indexing facilitates searching within the selected video which may be especially useful for longer videos where the localization of information is time consuming. This may be useful to people interested in a particular topic covered in the video or to bloggers or reporters searching for a particular quote. In particular embodiments user interface enables a user to link to a video with a particular search query filled in.

In particular embodiments user interface may provide links to the search page as a sharing option. In particular embodiments user interface enables a user to link to one or more particular instants in a video. As an example and not by way of limitation a user at user interface may select particular instants in the video and have user interface generate a link to the video that includes data representing the particular instants in the video selected by the user. The user may select a particular instant in the video by left clicking on or otherwise selecting a marker on playbar that user interface has placed there automatically in response to a search inside the video after the user has navigated to the web page containing the video. In addition or as an alternative to user interface placing a marker on playbar in response to a search inside the video after the user has navigated to the web page user interface may place a marker on playbar in response to a search initiated at another web page that led to the web page. Playbar may already include one or more markers when the user navigates to the web page. In particular embodiments the user may tag a marker on playbar as a selected instant in the video to distinguish it from other markers which may be of less interest to the user for sharing purposes. The user may tag marker as a selected instant in the video by right clicking on or otherwise selecting marker and in a pop up menu that appears in response to the user selection selecting an appropriate menu option. User interface may change a color of marker for example from yellow to red to indicate that the user has tagged it as a selected instant in the video.

In addition or as an alternative to user interface automatically placing markers on playbar the user may manually place one or more markers on playbar . In particular embodiments the user may manually place a marker at a particular location on playbar which may for example correspond to a particular time a particular point in time with respect to one or more of the beginning of the video or an end of the video or a particular frame of the video by left clicking on or otherwise selecting the particular location on playbar where the user wants marker to be. In addition or as an alternative to a user selecting a location for a marker on playbar by left clicking on playbar at the location on playbar where the user wants marker to be the user may play the video and during playback of the video left click on or otherwise select a designated button or other icon on user interface . In response to the user left clicking on or otherwise selecting the designated button or other icon user interface may place a marker at a location on playbar corresponding to a point in time in the playback of the video when the user left clicked on or otherwise selected the designated button or other icon. In particular embodiments when a user manually places a marker at a particular location on playbar user interface may automatically move marker back e.g. toward the beginning of the video a predetermined amount of time such as two seconds to account for a potential time delay between the user recognizing an instant in the video that is of interest to the user and the user selecting a particular location on playbar or selecting a designated button or other icon on user interface .

A marker on playbar may correspond to the beginning of a portion of the video that is particularly relevant to the user e.g. a portion of the video that the user wants to share with one or more other users. In addition or as an alternative a marker on playbar may correspond to an end of a portion of the video that is particularly relevant to the user. The user may tag a marker as the beginning of a portion of the video that is particularly relevant to the user by right clicking on or otherwise selecting marker and in a pop up menu that appears in response to the user selection selecting an appropriate menu option. Similarly the user may tag a marker as the end of a portion of the video that is particularly relevant to the user by right clicking on or otherwise selecting marker and in a pop up menu that appears in response to the user selection selecting an appropriate menu option. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable menu option for any suitable tagging of any suitable marker according to particular needs. In particular embodiments the user may remove a marker from playbar by right clicking on or otherwise selecting marker and in a pop up menu that appears in response to the user selection selecting an appropriate menu option.

In particular embodiments in addition or as an alternative to markers on playbar user interface may visually indicate particular instants in the video selected by the user by populating a designated area of user interface with text icons or both which may be similar to snippets or player controls representing the particular instants selected by the user. As an example and not by way of limitation this designated area may be located immediately below snippets in a demarcated space. The text icons or both in the designated area may facilitate the user keeping track of particular instants in the video selected by the user.

In particular embodiments user interface may generate a link such as for example a URL to the video that includes data representing one or more instants in the video selected by the user. The user may communicate the link to another user and when the other user clicks on or otherwise selects the link a web browser or other software application of the other user may fetch automatically a web page that the hyperlink points to. Automatically or in response to input from the other user instead of the video starting to play from a beginning of the video the video may start playing for the user at the first of the particular instants in the video represented by the data in the link. If the data in the link includes a stopping point the video may stop playing once playback of the video has reached the stopping point. User interface may generate a link to the video with data representing the instants in the video selected by the user in response to a user selecting a link icon . In particular embodiments a link generator which may include a hardware software or embedded logic component or combination of two or more such components for generating links in response to user input may generate the link. The link generator may but need not necessarily be embedded in user interface . User interface may output the link by displaying it in field . In particular embodiments data representing an instant in a video may have the format xxx AmBs where xxx is a document identifier ID A represents minutes and B represents seconds. As an example and not by way of limitation user interface may include the data in a link to a video as follows http video.google.com videoplay docid xxx AmBs. In particular embodiments a YOUTUBE link that has for example t 1m10s appended to the URL for video playback may allow for playback starting with a given time. Although the present disclosure describes a particular format for data representing an instant in a video for inclusion in a link to the video the present disclosure contemplates any suitable format for representing an instant in a video for inclusion in any suitable link to the video.

Software supporting user interface e.g. software providing the functionality of user interface described or illustrated herein may reside at a client one or more servers or both according to particular needs. As an example and not by way of limitation a server may communicate one or more web page or other files to a client and client may render user interface for a user at client . Using software residing locally at client client may respond to input provided by the user including for example generating a link to a video that includes data representing one or more instants in a video selected by the user. As another example a server may communicate one or more web page or other files to a client and client may render user interface for a user at client . In response to input provided by the user at client client may communicate requests to server . Using software at server server may generate a response including for example a link to a video that includes data representing one or more instants in a video as requested by the user to the request from Client and communicate the response to client for presentation to the user. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable arrangement between a client and one or more servers or other devices for supporting user interface and carrying out one or more processes underlying the functionality of user interface described or illustrated herein.

In particular embodiments user interface may generate the link and insert the data representing the one or more particular instants in the video selected by the user into the link. In particular embodiments user interface may communicate the data representing the one or more particular instants in the video selected by the user to a server which may generate the link and insert the data into the link. As described above the data representing the one or more particular instants in the video selected by the user may be inserted into the link by embedding a data represent a particular instant corresponding to a start time using the following format http video.google.com videoplay docid xxx AmBs where xxx is a document identifier ID A represents minutes and B represents seconds. This can direct the playback to commence at A minutes B seconds from the beginning of the video. After the link has been generated and the data representing the particular instants in the video selected by the user have been added to the link the user may communicate the link to another user for example by e mail IM or otherwise. As described above the other user may receive and click on or otherwise select the link which may direct a web browser of the user to a web page containing the video. Automatically or in response to input from the other user the video may start playing for the user at the first of the one or more particular instants in the video represented by the data in the link. If the data in the link includes a stopping point the video may stop playing once playback of the video has reached the stopping point.
