title: Selective interactivity
abstract: A system may selectively deliver interactive portions of a piece of content, based for example on a recipient user's historical tendency to use interactive portions of prior content. Multiple levels of interactivity may be defined for a given piece of content, such as an advertisement, and different users may receive different levels of interactivity based on how much they use interactive features. Some users may receive no interactive features at all, while others may receive the interactive features, and despite the fact that all of the users' devices may be perfectly capable of processing the interactive features for the user. The omission from transmission may conserve bandwidth and transmission resources.

The growing sophistication among users and their content consumption devices such as their digital video recorders DVRs tablet computers etc. has led to an increased availability of interactive options when consuming content. Watching a television program may include interactive options to respond to the program. These options consume bandwidth and transmission resources however and there remains an ever present need to more efficiently use available resources.

The following summary is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit or constrain the detailed description.

Some of the features described herein may allow a content provider a data services provider a network operator or the like to selectively avoid delivering interactive content or an interactive portion of a piece of content to users who are not likely to actually use the interactive content. For example if a television commercial includes an interactive option allowing a user to request more information about an advertised product that option might be delivered to a first user who often or regularly responds to such options but the option might not be delivered to a second user who seldom or never responds to such options. Even if the second user s devices have the processing resources needed to offer the interactive option network resources that would otherwise be consumed by delivering unwanted or unlikely to be used interactive data or components would be saved.

In some embodiments one or more computing devices may monitor a user s historical level of usage of interactive features that accompany or are included in content consumed by the user. The user s historical level of usage of interactive features may be monitored and stored or learned to determine a level of interactivity. Such levels alone or together with other data may be used to deliver content such as different content to the user. Different levels of interactivity may be defined for a piece of content such as one with no interactivity and another with one or varying levels of interactivity such as an option to receive additional information to manipulate a graphical object displayed in the content etc.

In some embodiments a one or more computing devices may store or otherwise have access to information identifying one or more conditions for a user to receive interactive features and for each of a plurality of interactive features conditions for varying levels of interactivity. The conditions may identify a frequency with which a user historically accesses interactive content or a frequency with which a user historically uses a preidentified interface or random option with interactive content.

In some embodiments it may determined that two sequential pieces of content have interactive options and that the user is engaged with an interactive option for a first one of the sequential pieces of content. In response interactive features of the second one of the pieces of sequential content may not be transmitted to the user or removed from the second content before the second content is sent to the user.

Some embodiments may involve identifying a plurality of interactive features available for a piece of content e.g. video content delivering the video content to a plurality of user devices and selectively delivering some or all of the interactive features to the plurality of user devices e.g. based on corresponding or particular users historical patterns of using interactive features. One disclosed implementation may also select interactive features for a user based on a frequency with which the user has previously engaged in interactive features and or based on what type of features were engaged. The implementation may identify one or more user interface options for a first one of the interactive features and determine a frequency with which the user has previously engaged in interactive features using the identified one or more user interface options. It may also identify one or more user consumption devices for a user and determine a frequency with which the user has previously engaged in interactive features using the identified one or more user consumption devices. In some embodiments the determination of whether to send an interactive feature to a user may be made based on the type of interactive features that the user uses without requiring any particular frequency of use. For example if the user uses reacts to interactive features that are games but not to features that merely provide additional information about an advertised product then the system may withhold the unused interactive feature type from future advertisements that are sent to the user.

The summary here is not an exhaustive listing of the novel features described herein and are not limiting of the claims. These and other features are described in greater detail below.

In the following description of various illustrative embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments in which aspects of the disclosure may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

Various features described herein allow for the conservation of transmission resources such as bandwidth when delivering information e.g. software data etc. for interactive experiences that accompany a primary presentation of information. For example some video advertisements may include interactive features that the user can use to engage with the ad. In some embodiments these features may be withheld from certain users who are deemed to be unlikely to actually take advantage of the interactive features. Withholding the delivery of those interactive features to those users may help conserve data transmission bandwidth and processing.

There may be one link originating from the local office and it may be split a number of times to distribute the signal to various premises in the vicinity which may be many miles of the local office . The links may include components not illustrated such as splitters filters amplifiers etc. to help convey the signal clearly but in general each split introduces a bit of signal degradation. Portions of the links may also be implemented with fiber optic cable while other portions may be implemented with coaxial cable other lines or wireless communication paths. By running fiber optic cable along some portions for example signal degradation may be significantly minimized allowing a single local office to reach even farther with its network of links than before.

The local office may include an interface such as a termination system TS . More specifically the interface may be a cable modem termination system CMTS which may be one or more computing devices configured to manage communications between devices on the network of links and backend devices such as servers to be discussed further below . The interface may be as specified in a standard such as the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification DOCSIS standard published by Cable Television Laboratories Inc. a.k.a. CableLabs or it may be a similar or modified device instead. The interface may be configured to place data on one or more downstream frequencies to be received by modems at the various premises and to receive upstream communications from those modems on one or more upstream frequencies.

The local office may also include one or more network interfaces which can permit the local office to communicate with various other external networks . These networks may include for example networks of Internet devices telephone networks cellular telephone networks fiber optic networks local wireless networks e.g. WiMAX satellite networks and any other desired network and the network interface may include the corresponding circuitry needed to communicate on the external networks and to other devices on the network such as a cellular telephone network and its corresponding cell phones.

As noted above the local office may include a variety of servers that may be configured to perform various functions. For example the local office may include a push notification server . The push notification server may generate push notifications to deliver data and or commands to the various premises in the network or more specifically to the devices in the premises that are configured to detect such notifications . The local office may also include a content server . The content server may be one or more computing devices that are configured to provide content to users at their premises. This content may be for example video on demand movies television programs songs text listings etc. The content server may include software to validate user identities and entitlements to locate and retrieve requested content to encrypt the content and to initiate delivery e.g. streaming of the content to the requesting user s and or device s .

The local office may also include one or more application servers . An application server may be one or more computing devices configured to offer any desired service and may run various languages and operating systems e.g. servlets and JSP pages running on Tomcat MySQL OSX BSD Ubuntu Redhat HTMLS JavaScript AJAX and COMET . For example an application server may be responsible for collecting television program listings information and generating a data download for electronic program guide listings. Another application server may be responsible for monitoring user viewing habits and collecting that information for use in selecting advertisements. Yet another application server may be responsible for formatting and inserting advertisements in a video stream being transmitted to the premises . Although shown separately one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the push server content server and application server may be combined. Further here the push server content server and application server are shown generally and it will be understood that they may each contain memory storing computer executable instructions to cause a processor to perform steps described herein and or memory for storing data.

An example premises such as a home may include an interface . The interface can include any communication circuitry needed to allow a device to communicate on one or more links with other devices in the network. For example the interface may include a modem which may include transmitters and receivers used to communicate on the links and with the local office . The modem may be for example a coaxial cable modem for coaxial cable lines a fiber interface node for fiber optic lines twisted pair telephone modem cellular telephone transceiver satellite transceiver local wi fi router or access point or any other desired modem device. Also although only one modem is shown in a plurality of modems operating in parallel may be implemented within the interface . Further the interface may include a gateway interface device . The modem may be connected to or be a part of the gateway interface device . The gateway interface device may be one or more computing devices that communicates with the modem s to allow one or more other devices in the premises to communicate with the local office and other devices beyond the local office . The gateway may be a set top box STB digital video recorder DVR computer server or any other desired computing device. The gateway may also include not shown local network interfaces to provide communication signals to requesting entities devices in the premises such as display devices e.g. televisions additional STBs or DVRs personal computers laptop computers wireless devices e.g. wireless routers wireless laptops notebooks tablets and netbooks cordless phones e.g. Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephone DECT phones mobile phones mobile televisions personal digital assistants PDA etc. landline phones e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP phones and any other desired devices. Examples of the local network interfaces include Multimedia Over Coax Alliance MoCA interfaces Ethernet interfaces universal serial bus USB interfaces wireless interfaces e.g. IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.15 analog twisted pair interfaces Bluetooth interfaces and others.

The example is a hardware configuration although the illustrated components may be implemented as software as well. Modifications may be made to add remove combine divide etc. components of the computing device as desired. Additionally the components illustrated may be implemented using basic computing devices and components and the same components e.g. processor ROM storage display etc. may be used to implement any of the other computing devices and components described herein. For example the various components herein may be implemented using computing devices having components such as a processor executing computer executable instructions stored on a computer readable medium as illustrated in . Some or all of the entities described herein may be software based and may co exist in a common physical platform e.g. a requesting entity can be a separate software process and program from a dependent entity both of which may be executed as software on a common computing device .

One or more aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in a computer usable data and or computer executable instructions such as in one or more program modules executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally program modules include routines programs objects components data structures etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types when executed by a processor in a computer or other data processing device. The computer executable instructions may be stored on one or more computer readable media such as a hard disk optical disk removable storage media solid state memory RAM etc. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments. In addition the functionality may be embodied in whole or in part in firmware or hardware equivalents such as integrated circuits field programmable gate arrays FPGA and the like. Particular data structures may be used to more effectively implement one or more aspects of the disclosure and such data structures are contemplated within the scope of computer executable instructions and computer usable data described herein.

An interactive feature may accompany the primary video presentation. In the example a pop up message may appear inviting the user to press a button on an associated remote control e.g. a DVR remote a computer keyboard etc. to request more information about a displayed product. For example the pop up message may invite the user to press an OK button on a remote control and in response to doing so the providers of the primary video may arrange to have additional related information sent to the requesting user. In the illustrated example the requesting user might receive additional information regarding an automobile being advertised in the main video .

Pressing the OK button to request more information is one example of an interactive function accompanying the main video . Supporting this interactivity may involve transmitting additional content for the feature such as a command to cause the user s display device to present the pop up the textual message in the pop up and one or more instructions to be executed if the user presses the OK button while the pop up is displayed. This additional information may be sent as part of a video stream delivering the main video or in a separate stream that is transmitted apart from the main video s stream e.g. in a separate concurrent stream or delivered in advance etc. . For example an MPEG Moving Picture Experts Group stream may use an elementary stream MPEG ES to carry software and or data to provide an interactive experience in conjunction with the main video stream.

The example showed a relatively simple form of interactivity. illustrates an example of a more complicated form of interactivity. In the example the viewer may be presented with an interactive feature to press a direction on a corresponding control e.g. directional keypad on a remote control keyboard tablet etc. to change the color of an automobile shown in the main video . This form of interactivity may require more data to support. For example software instructions may need to be provided to identify the portion s of the screen that are to change color e.g. identifying the car as an object in the screen identify the available colors and responses to the button press in addition to the messaging and pop up data discussed above for the example. The additional or alternative data needed to offer the interactive feature may be sent in the same types of additional streams e.g. the MPEG ES or other related stream discussed above in the example but would require a larger amount of bandwidth and processing to handle.

Supporting this more sophisticated interactive option may require transmission of even more data than used in the experience. The secondary stream may need to carry instructions for coordinating communications with the tablet identifying the viewer s table e.g. as distinguished from other devices that the user may own such as a smartphone or other computing device communicating with a chat server for the automobile advertiser etc. Features herein may help reduce the amount of interactivity data that is needed to be transmitted and illustrates an example process for accomplishing this.

In step a computing device such as an application server may determine whether an advertisement update is desired. In general an update may be desired whenever a new advertisement is added to the application server for eventual delivery to users e.g. when an advertiser provides its new commercial to a service provider or when an existing advertisement is modified e.g. the advertiser may decide to remove an interactive contest option because the contest has ended . This determination may be made proactively or in response to consideration of a variety of factors. For example a system administrator may decide to upload a new commercial that has been received from a sponsor e.g. of a television program or a service provider may decide to insert a new local commercial into a national transmission e.g. a multicast feed. Updates may also entail modifying existing advertisements. For example a sponsor may decide to cut a 30 second commercial down to only 15 seconds. Or the sponsor may wish to change or remove or add the interactive features that accompany an existing commercial. For example the sponsor may decide to place additional restrictions on a promotional contest e.g. reducing a coupon s value raising eligibility requirements etc. if initial response to the promotion has exceeded expectations.

If an advertisement update is needed or desired then in step one or more computing device may identify one or more levels of interactivity for the new or updated advertisement. This identification may be made by a user e.g. a system administrator using an interface indicating levels of interactivity or it can be performed automatically e.g. a computing device such as an advertising server may retrieve an indicated advertisement and the additional interactivity may be transmitted with the ad . The levels may vary depending on the content and the illustrate one example of how a single piece of content e.g. an automobile advertisement can have multiple levels of interactivity.

In step one or more computing devices may prepare the different levels of interactivity for delivery to users. This preparation may entail retrieving the software and data associated with each level of interactivity and processing the software and data for transmission on any delivery networks e.g. network to be used to deliver the interactive content to users. For example separate MPEG elementary streams may be prepared for each level of interactivity and information may be stored to indicate which stream corresponds to which level of interactivity. In some embodiments this preparation of interactivity levels may involve first determining whether any users are expected to want the interactivity. For example it may be possible that in an entire neighborhood serviced by an advertising server no households have ever engaged in a type of interactivity that can be offered with an advertisement e.g. an automobile commercial that includes an interactive option to initiate a video chat session with a local dealer representative . In such a situation the advertising server may determine that step may be skipped.

One or more computing devices may also store conditional information applicable to the different levels of interactivity. The conditional information may identify one or more prerequisites preferences or conditions that may help determine whether a particular interactive feature is to be delivered to a particular user. One condition may be based on the user s consumption device for the main content such as main video . For example the interactivity level may only be applicable if the user is using a DVR to view the content e.g. if the software used to change the color of the automobile is written to run on the DVR s processor or if the user is using a device that supports the software language in which the color changing feature is written.

Another condition may involve other devices besides the one used for the main content. For example the interactive chat feature may require the presence of the second computing device . For this level of interactive service the computing device may store information indicating that the service should only be provided to users who have a registered secondary device that supports that feature. This condition may also require certain types of networks or connection qualities and or availability of certain interface options on the user s main and or secondary device. For example availability of directional buttons accelerometers gyroscopes cameras and other features may be a condition for using certain interactive features e.g. one feature may involve the user tilting the second device to see different views of the automobile and that feature would only be of use to users whose devices have an accelerometer gyroscope .

Another condition may involve the user s previous history of using interactive features. For example a service provider or any party may store information indicating that the highest level of interactivity should only be delivered to users who regularly interact with interactive feature. Using the examples the service provider may determine that the level of interactivity should only be delivered to users who use 80 or more of offered interactivity and that the level of interactivity should only be delivered to users who use between 30 and 79 of offered interactivity and that users who use 29 or less of offered interactivity should only be presented with the level of interactivity. These requirement levels described herein may indicate a probability that the user will use the corresponding type of interactivity e.g. the user is 30 likely to hit the ok button on a pop up . The conditions may also indicate a frequency with which the user uses specific devices and or interface options and or the types of interactive options used e.g. options for additional information sports or movies genres shopping commerce education travel etc. . For example one level of interactivity may be limited to those users who use their accelerometers a minimum of 60 of the time that interactive features involving accelerometers are presented to the user e.g. a commercial may invite users who are viewing the commercial on a tablet having an accelerometer to rotate their tablet and see alternative views of an advertised product such as an automobile .

Another condition may involve the current state of the data delivery network and the available bandwidth. For example the service provider may establish network conditions that must be met before a particular level of interactive service is delivered to a user. For example the highest level of interactive service may require the greatest amount of data traffic and the service provider may establish a condition that prohibits delivery of the highest level if the available bandwidth falls below a predetermined amount e.g. 20 . The service provider may for example adjust the percentages in the previous condition upwards or downwards in response to changing network conditions and available bandwidth. If bandwidth availability is low then the service provider could increase the 80 threshold for the highest level of interactivity to a higher value such as 90 . Raising this threshold may reduce the amount of traffic needed to deliver interactive experiences to accommodate the lowered amount of available bandwidth.

Another condition may include a time based restriction on a number of interactive features that can be offered to the user. Some content providers may wish to limit the number of interactive features to potentially help avoid overloading users and to keep interactive features new and interesting for users. Such a condition may for example indicate that a user should be given no more than one interactive feature offering per hour of programming consumed.

The computing device may also store combinations of any of the conditions described above. For example a condition may be a combination of a network condition and device condition e.g. allow interactivity on the user s tablet when the user is viewing content on the DVR only if available bandwidth to the user exceeds 30 of available capacity to the user .

In step the computing device may determine for one or more users who may in a group region or associated with a particular distribution device or network whether a user update is desired. A user update may be desired when there is a change in a user s account or profile information. For example if a new user registers for a content delivery service then a user update may be desired to establish user profile parameters identifying the content and or services that may be delivered to the user and their corresponding conditions. As another example a user who is already registered may need to update his her registration information when the user obtains a new computer tablet or other device or if the user wishes to identify a different device for receipt of the primary and or interactive content or change the conditions of service.

If a user update is desired then in step the user s configuration information may be updated or created in the case of a new user . The configuration information may include a database storing information identifying the user the user s payment parameters if applicable the services and content accessible to the user and various conditions under which interactive features are to be offered to the user. A user may update the configuration for his her account for example by logging in to a web page for a service provider. In doing so the user may adjust various personal preference parameters surrounding the user s access to interactive content that is associated with a main content being consumed. Examples of these parameters are discussed below.

As one example the user may identify a preferred device for receiving interactive content or for providing responses to interactive content. For example the user may specify one or more devices e.g. the user s tablet smartphone personal computer DVR etc. on which the user wishes to receive interactive content. The individual devices may be registered with the service provider as part of the user registration process.

The identification of preferred device may also depend on which device is being used to present the main content. For example the user may indicate that when main content is being displayed on Television identified using any suitable identification such as name device identifier MAC Media Access Control address etc. the user wishes to receive interactive content associated with the main content on the user s DVR that is supplying the television with the main content and or on the user s tablet computer. The user may also indicate that when the main content is being displayed on the user s tablet computer then the associated interactive content should be delivered to the user s tablet as well to be displayed alongside the main content and that the DVR need not receive the interactive content.

The personal preferences can also identify the user s device s interactive capabilities and whether those capabilities are accessible for interactive content. For example the user s smart phone may include a front facing camera rear facing camera global positioning system GPS a compass and an accelerometer and the stored preference information may identify these capabilities as well as any indication as to whether the user wishes to permit their use for interactive features e.g. a user may wish to not use any interactive features that require an accelerometer or that would use a camera on their tablet or smart phone .

The personal preferences can also identify the types of main content for which the user does or does not wish to engage in interactive content. For example if the user enjoys participating in game shows then the user s profile may indicate that the user wishes to receive that form of interactive content. If the user does not wish to participate in news program polling then the user s profile may also indicate that distaste of the user.

As noted above the user configuration update may be initiated by a user accessing a service provider web page. In some embodiments the user profile may also be updated by the service provider. Many of the same parameters discussed above can be tracked by the service provider as well and stored in a service provider database at the computing device . For example the service provider may store information identifying the user and identifying the number of times and or frequency with which the user engages with interactive content.

The service provider may store information identifying the device s that the user uses to engage with interactive content and which devices are most favored by the user. For example the service provider may note that a user uses his her tablet to respond to thirty 30 interactive offerings per week and uses his her DVR to respond to fifty interactive offerings per week and that the user never uses his her personal computer or smart phone to engage with interactive features.

The service provider may track the types of interactive content and corresponding main content that the user favors. For example the service provider may track a percentage of interactive offerings to which the user responds and the characteristics of those offerings. The service provider computing device may determine that the user responds to 75 of interactive offerings that are related to automobile advertisements and only 10 of the interactive offerings that are related to home cleansers.

The service provider computing device may determine that of the interactive features that the user used the user used his her DVR controller 90 of the time used his her tablet computer 10 of the time and never used his her smart phone.

The service provider computing device may also monitor the user s device features that were used for interactive responses. For example the computing device may note that the user consistently responded to interactive features that relied on a tablet computer s accelerometer and that the user occasionally e.g. 50 of the time took advantage of the table computer s GPS capabilities when using interactive content but that the user never used an available front facing camera on the tablet device.

The service provider computing device may also monitor the types of interactive features that the user tended to enjoy. For example the examples showed various features. If the user regularly e.g. 80 of the time offered selected the OK button to receive more information but rarely e.g. 0.05 of the time offered selected directional buttons to change color of the object then the computing device may store information indicating this history. Types of interactive features may include game playing manipulation of 3 D objects changing of color and or appearance of graphical objects features that require initiation of additional data streams of content and any other desired form of interaction.

The various configuration preferences and tracked information discussed above can be combined as well. For example the user may indicate a preference using a combination of the device capability preference and main content device preference e.g. when main content is viewed on a display connected to the user s DVR use the user s tablet computer for interactive features but do not use the tablet s accelerometer however if the main content is viewed on the tablet then use the tablet for interactive features and enable the accelerometer .

In step the computing device may determine whether it is time to deliver an interactive advertisement to a user. To make this determination the computing device may first be provided with information identifying content that the user and various other users is watching and the playback time of the user s consumption of the content. For example the computing device may note the time when the user began watching the a program on demand and may retrieve a schedule of when interactive segments such as but not limited to advertisements are to appear in the program or during a commercial break in the program and by comparing the current time with the schedule the computing device may determine when it is time to deliver an advertisement to the user.

This determination may also be simpler if the user is consuming a scheduled multicast content that is being transmitted according to a predetermined schedule as opposed to on demand . For example a linear broadcast of a nightly news program may begin at 6 pm on weeknights with predetermined commercial breaks at 6 08 6 12 and 6 18. The computing device may obtain from the user s consumption device e.g. a DVR tablet computer smart phone etc. an identification of the scheduled program that the user is viewing and may retrieve information identifying the predetermined commercial break schedule for the program to determine when it is time to deliver an advertisement to the user.

If it is time then in step the computing device may obtain the user s profile in step by retrieving the one or more data files containing the user s information. As discussed above the user s profile may identify a wide range of interactivity preferences of the user and the interactivity feature usage history of the user.

In step the computing device may obtain the network status. The network status may indicate for example the amount of current network usage being made by the user or by all users served by the computing device and the amount of available resources e.g. bandwidth processing capacity at the interactive feature application server etc. .

In step the computing device may determine the appropriate advertisement interactivity level for the user based on the user profile information and the network status information and on the overall available number of levels provided by the content source e.g. the producer of the advertisement . By selecting the interactivity level the computing device may avoid the transmission of software instructions and data for interactive features that the user is not likely to use or that the user does not wish to receive thereby conserving that amount of bandwidth. Note that in doing so the user s consumption and or second device may be fully capable of supporting the interactive features e.g. the user s device may have all the resources needed to process and display the interactive features but the decision to send a lower level of interactivity and omit certain interactive features may result in sending the user a version of the content that omits features that the user s device is able to support. On a larger scale the computing device may service a wide range of users all of whom may have devices that are able to handle interactive features but rather than consume the bandwidth to transmit these features to all of the users devices the computing device may selectively transmit the interactive features to just the users who are more likely to actually use the interactive features. In some embodiments a user who originally did not receive interactive features may request to have those features delivered to him her via an upstream command. The user may also change his her interactivity settings to allow selected levels of interactivity for different programs and or services and can also reset his her settings to allow the system to reset the user s history information and start anew with tracking the user s behavior patterns.

In step the computing device may retrieve the software and data needed to support the selected ad interactivity level and generate one or more data transmission streams to provide the resources for the interactive features. As noted above the additional transmission stream may be an MPEG ES accompanying an MPEG stream that carries the main video . In such an embodiment the user s MPEG decoder e.g. within the consumption device being used to consume the main content may decode the MPEG ES and provide the contents to the device e.g. the same consumption device or a different one that will provide the user with the interactive feature and those contents when executed by the receiving device may result in providing the interactive experience to the user. If from step it was determined that no interactive features are to be provided to the user for the current advertisement then in step the ad may simply be transmitted in a basic form without interactive features.

In step the computing device may receive information from the user s consumption device e.g. DVR and or the user s secondary device e.g. tablet indicating a degree with which the user is engaging in the interactive features. This may include providing user input responses that the user has entered in to the devices e.g. button keypresses menu options chosen motion detected via accelerometer etc. . Alternatively this information may indicate that the user declined to engage in any of the interactive features that were transmitted and offered or otherwise made available to the user.

In step the computing device may update the user s profile adding information identifying the interactive features that were transmitted to the user and the level of responsive interaction made by the user. The stored information may also indicate whether the user has concluded using the interactive features. This information may be useful for avoiding inundating the user with interactive options before the user is ready for them. For example if two commercials are transmitted sequentially each with an interactive feature the user may choose to interact with the first one. If by the time the first commercial ends and the second commercial begins the user is still engaged with the interactive feature related to the first commercial then in step for the second commercial the computing device may determine that the interactive portion of the ad should not be delivered to the user because the user is already engaged in an interactive session for the first commercial.

In step the computing device may determine whether the user s interactivity requires further response. For example if the user selected to initiate a chat session to ask about an advertised automobile then the computing device may take steps necessary for establishing the requested chat session with the automobile provider. The appropriate response will depend on the type of interactive feature that was offered and the software instructions and or data needed for the response may be established when the advertisement s interactivity levels were prepared in step .

In some embodiments the response may involve a reward for the user. An advertiser may run a promotion with prizes and if the user s response satisfies the advertiser s conditions e.g. scoring a certain number of points in an interactive game then the user may be granted the corresponding reward.

If a response is needed then in step the computing device may retrieve the associated software instructions for the advertisement s response and execute them to provide the response.

As a result of the process a user who is likely to use interactive content may receive the content with its interactive portion while a user who is not likely to user interactive content may receive just the non interactive portion of the content e.g. an audiovisual portion without the interactive portion e.g. information that supports viewing alternative images of a product being advertised . illustrates this conceptually. The content may include both an interactive portion e.g. a script that allows the user to view different images of an advertised product and a non interactive other portion e.g. audio and video for a second commercial with no interactivity . This content may be processed by a computing device executing a decision engine or business rules to determine which users are likely to use interactive content. Users who are unlikely to use the interactive portion may receive the other portion of the content without the interactive portion while users who are likely to use the interactive portion receive both the interactive portion and the other portion
