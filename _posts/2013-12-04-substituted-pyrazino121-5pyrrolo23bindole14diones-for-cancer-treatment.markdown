In some embodiments M includes within its scope any unit of a Ligand L that for example binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target cell population. In some embodiments a Ligand is a molecule that binds to complexes with or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. In some embodiments the Ligand unit acts to deliver the drug unit e.g. a compound of formulae I c or I d to the particular target cell population with which the Ligand unit reacts. Such Ligands include but are not limited to large molecular weight proteins such as for example full length antibodies antibody fragments smaller molecular weight proteins polypeptide or peptides lectins glycoproteins non peptides vitamins nutrient transport molecules such as but not limited to transferring or any other cell binding molecule or substance nucleic acids and their derivatives and analogs. In some embodiments a Ligand is modified from its corresponding natural form by for example amino acid mutations including substitutions deletions insertions etc incorporation of unnatural building blocks such as unnatural amino acids and unnatural nucleotides e.g. those with unnatural bases sugars and or internucleoside linkages chemical modifications and or conjugation with other small or macro molecules. In some embodiments M comprises a reactive functional group such as an amine NH aldehyde CHO carboxyl COOH or a sulfhydryl group SH or can be modified to contain such a functional group.

In some embodiments M is an antibody. In some embodiments an antibody refers to any immunoglobulin whether natural or wholly or partially synthetically produced. All derivatives thereof which maintain specific binding ability are also included. In some embodiments an antibody also covers any protein having a binding domain which is homologous or largely homologous to an immunoglobulin binding domain. Such proteins may be derived from natural sources or partly or wholly synthetically produced. An antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal. An antibody may be a member of any immunoglobulin class including any of the human classes IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE. In certain embodiments an antibody may be a member of the IgG immunoglobulin class. In some embodiments M is an antibody fragment or characteristic portion of an antibody which refers to any derivative of an antibody which is less than full length. In general an antibody fragment retains at least a significant portion of the full length antibody s specific binding ability. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fab Fab F ab scFv Fv dsFv diabody and Fd fragments. An antibody fragment may be produced by any means. For example an antibody fragment may be enzymatically or chemically produced by fragmentation of an intact antibody and or it may be recombinantly produced from a gene encoding the partial antibody sequence. Alternatively or additionally an antibody fragment may be wholly or partially synthetically produced. An antibody fragment may optionally comprise a single chain antibody fragment. Alternatively or additionally an antibody fragment may comprise multiple chains which are linked together for example by disulfide linkages.

In some embodiments an antibody may be a humanized antibody. Exemplary antibody embodiments for M include intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.

Useful polyclonal antibodies as Ligand are in some embodiments heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest. For example for the production of polyclonal antibodies various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof including but not limited to rabbits mice rats and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete adjuvant mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Useful monoclonal antibodies as Ligand are in some embodiments homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant e.g. a cancer cell antigen a viral antigen a microbial antigen a protein a peptide a carbohydrate a chemical nucleic acid or fragments thereof . A monoclonal antibody mAb to an antigen of interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by K hler and Milstein 1975256 495 497 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kozbor et al. 19834 72 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. 1985 Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 . Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG IgM IgE IgA and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.

Useful monoclonal antibodies include but are not limited to human monoclonal antibodies humanized monoclonal antibodies antibody fragments or chimeric human mouse or other species monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art e.g. Teng et al. 198380 7308 7312 Kozbor et al. 19834 72 79 and Olsson et al. 198292 3 16 .

The antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Milstein et al. 1983305 537 539 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Similar procedures are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C2 and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region C1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. Nucleic acids with sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In an embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation International Publication No. WO 94 04690 .

For further details for generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 1986 121 210 Rodrigues et al. 1993151 6954 6961 Carter et al. 199210 163 167 Carter et al. 19954 463 470 Merchant et al. 199816 677 681. Using such techniques bispecific antibodies can be prepared for use in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.

Bifunctional antibodies are also described in European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 105 360. In some embodiments hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically i.e. by cell fusion techniques or chemically especially with cross linking agents or disulfide bridge forming reagents and may comprise whole antibodies and or fragments thereof. Methods for obtaining such hybrid antibodies are disclosed for example in International Publication WO 83 03679 and European Patent Publication No. EPA 0 217 577. Bifunctional antibodies include those biologically prepared from a polydoma or quadroma or which are synthetically prepared with cross linking agents such as bis maleimido methyl ether BMME or with other cross linking agents familiar to those skilled in the art.

An antibody can be a functionally active fragment derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens or other antibodies bound to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard functionally active means that the fragment derivative or analog is able to elicit anti anti idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art e.g. the BIA core assay See for e.g. Kabat et al. 1991 Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. Kabat E et al. 1980125 3 961 969 .

Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as but not limited to F ab fragments which contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab fragments. Other useful antibodies are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies SCAs e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird 1988242 423 42 Huston et al. 198885 5879 5883 and Ward et al. 1989334 544 54 or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.

In some embodiments an antibody is an immunoglobulin antibody. In some embodiments an immunoglobulin antibody recognizes a tumor associated antigen.

In some embodiments an antibody is a recombinant antibody such as a chimeric and or a humanized monoclonal antibodies comprising both human and non human portions which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions. See e.g. Cabilly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Boss et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 397. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. See e.g. Queen U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089. Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art for example using methods described in International Publication No. WO 87 02671 European Patent Publication No. 184 187 European Patent Publication No. 171496 European Patent Publication No. 173494 International Publication No. WO 86 01533 U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 European Patent Publication No. 12 023 Berter et al 1988 Science 240 1041 1043 Liu et al. 1987 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 3439 3443 Liu et al. 1987 J.

In some embodiments completely human antibodies are desirable and can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar 1995 Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 569 825 5 661 016 5 545 806. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from for example Abgenix Inc. Freemont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. .

Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope Jespers et al. 1994 12 899 903 . Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 Quan M.

However due to the synthetic challenges posed by the complex molecular architecture only very few structures could be made and even for those that have been synthesized only very limited amounts have been provided. Therefore although various ETP alkaloids have been assessed in a diverse array of biological tests the non uniformity of these studies precludes comparative analysis and the inference of meaningful conclusions. In some embodiments among other things the present invention recognizes that access to greater quantities of ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines and their analogs and derivatives is highly desired. In some embodiments the present invention provides methods for synthesizing ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines and analogs and derivatives thereof. In some embodiments the present invention provides methods for synthesizing ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines and analogs and derivatives thereof wherein the methods produce ETP alkaloids or thiodiketopiperazines or analogs and derivatives thereof in quantities large enough to enable uniform biological studies.

In some embodiments the present invention provides ETP or thiodiketopiperazine compounds and compositions thereof in quantities enough to enable uniform biological studies.

Exemplary structurally diverse ETP or thiodiketopiperazine alkaloids and analogs and derivatives thereof are depicted below 

Compounds that were differentially substituted at the C3 quaternary stereogenic center were constructed and then elaborated with different types of sulfur motifs. For example compounds 3 7 10 and 14 67 were concisely and efficiently accessed as described in Schemes E1 1 E1 3 or according to experimental procedures previously reported by our group.

endo Tetracyclic bromide 54 prepared from sarcosine 1 tryptophan cyclo dipeptide N. Boyer and M. Movassaghi 2012 3 1798 was used to access epidithiodiketopiperazines bearing different C3 substituents Scheme E1 I . Electrophilic activation using silver I tetrafluoroborate in nitroethane and trapping of the transient tertiary benzylic carbocation with the desired nucleophile i.e. fluoride N TIPS pyrrole E. M. Beck N. P. Grimster R. Hatley and M. J. Gaunt 2006 128 2528 anisole 5 Br N TIPS indole afforded the C3 substituted endo tetracycles 59 and 68 70 in high yields and excellent levels of regio and stereoselection N. Boyer and M. Movassaghi 2012 3 1798 . Dihydroxylation of 59 and 68 70 at the C11 methine and C15 methylene positions was achieved with tetra n butylammonium permanganate n BuNMnO 4 equiv in dichloromethane to provide the corresponding diols in moderate to good yields as single diastereomers. The direct double cis thiolation was accomplished in a single step and in good to high yields 47 80 by exposure of the bis hemiaminals to trifluoroacetic acid TFA in hydrogen sulfide saturated dichloromethane solution followed by mild aerobic oxidation to access the bridgehead disulfides as epimers 26 30 33 and epimers 34 35. The relative stereochemistry of the epimers 26 30 33 of the epidisulfide bridges has been confirmed by key NOESY cross peaks on the corresponding bis thiomethylether . In some embodiments the diastereoselectivities are consistent with the steric bias imposed by the C3 substituents ratio 2 1 C3 F 4 1 C3 Br 5 1 C3 pyrrol 3 yl 7 1 C3 indol 3 yl 10 1 C3 p MeOPh .

As exemplified in Scheme E1 2 a set of compounds with a modified sulfur motif within the DKP core were prepared. Chemo and stereoselective thiolation of diol 56 by treatment with TFA in hydrogen sulfide saturated dichloromethane solution at 0 C. generated the corresponding thiohemiaminal 48 in 90 yield and in a highly diastereoselective fashion 10 1 dr . Masking of both alcohol and thiol groups as isobutyrates and photoinduced reductive removal of the benzenesulfonyl group gave 51. The desired degree of sulfidation was eventually accomplished by hydrazinolysis chemoselective S sulfenylation with chloro triphenylmethane sulfane or disulfane followed by hafnium triflate mediated cyclization to afford 12 deoxybionectin A 10 and its epitrithiodiketopiperazine congener 29 in 65 and 47 yield 3 steps respectively. A similar two step approach was employed to access benzenesulfonyl protected epitri and epitetrathiodiketopiperazines 27 and 28 in 42 and 44 yield respectively. Ultimately reduction of the bridgehead disulfide with NaBHfollowed by in situ S methylation afforded gliocladin B 7 and bis methylthioether 39 in high yields.

 Gliocladin C 52 Y. Usami J. Yamaguchi and A. Numata 2004 63 1123 and several C11 hydroxylated 57 58 and C11 C12 dehydrogenated 53 intermediates were prepared following the procedures previously reported for the synthesis of this atypical non thiolated triketopiperazine N. Boyer and M. Movassaghi 2012 3 1798 .

Exposure of hemiaminal 56 to benzyl mercaptan and TFA in nitroethane resulted in the formation of the corresponding bis benzylthioether C15 C15 5.7 1 in 80 yield single diastereomer C15 . Further derivatization of the indole nitrogen with a t butoxycarbonyl group gave 43 in 69 yield. After masking the indole substituent of the key ETP intermediate 26 the bridgehead disulfide was reduced with NaBHand S methoxymethylated in a single flask. Subsequent t butoxycarbonyl removal with TFA in dichloromethane afforded bis thioether 40 in 66 yield over two steps. A similar strategy including the photoinduced reductive removal of the N1 benzenesulfonyl group provided 41 in 55 over three steps. Reduction of the sulfur bridge of ETP 24 with NaBHin a mixture of THF and methanol and in situ trapping of the resulting thiolates with 2 methoxyethoxy methyl chloride MEMCl led to thioether 47 and bis thioether 42 in 19 and 80 yield respectively.

Further modifications to the sulfur bridge were accomplished by treatment of the corresponding dithiol obtained from NaBHreduction of ETP 26 with 1 1 thiocarbonyldiimidazole TCDI or 1 1 carbonyldiimidazole CDI to afford di and trithiocarbonates 36 and 37 respectively. Similarly thioacetal 38 was accessed directly by double alkylation using diiodomethane. Desulfurization of epidithiodiketopiperazine 26 was realized by treatment with triethylphosphite in THF to give epimonosulfide 25 in 63 yield F. Cherblanc Y. P. Lo E. De Gussem L. Alcazar Fuoli E. Bignell Y. He N. Chapman Rothe P. Bultinck W. A. Herrebout R. Brown H. S. Rzepa and M. J. Fuchter . 2011 17 11868 . The sulfur atoms were also capped with the S acetyl and S methylsulfane functional groupings to afford compounds that are potentially more labile under intracellular conditions. After reduction of the sulfur bridge of epidisulfide 26 its treatment with an excess of acetyl chloride methanesulfenyl chloride or dimethyldisulfide afforded compounds 44 45 and 46 respectively in good yields.

Compounds with substituent at the C15 position were also prepared for example compounds derived from N methyl 1 alanine 1 tryptophan cyclo dipeptide. As exemplified in Scheme E1 3 synthesis of these derivatives commenced with endo tetracyclic bromide 73. Tertiary benzylic bromide 73 also proved to be an excellent substrate for the desired regio and stereoselective Friedel Crafts type coupling with 5 bromo 1 triisopropylsilylindole 67 over 2 steps to afford C3 indolyl tetracycle 74. Allylation of the C3 tertiary benzylic halide using allyltributylstannane under radical conditions K. M. Depew S. P. Marsden D. Zatorska A. Zatorski W. G. Bornmann and S. J. Danishefsky 1999 121 11953 followed by hydrogenation of the terminal olefin afforded C3 n propyl tetracycle 75. These two C3 substituted tetracyclic monomers were subsequently subject to hydroxylation conditions using bis pyridine silver I permanganate PyrAgMnO in pyridine. Treatment of the resultant diols with potassium trithiocarbonate and TFA in dichloromethane resulted in rapid formation of the desired monomeric dithiepanethiones 64 and 66 in 63 yield as a 5 1 isomeric mixture as well as 65 and 67 in 52 and 17 yield respectively. Exposure of these compounds to ethanolamine in acetone followed by oxidative workup using potassium triiodide yielded the corresponding epidithiodiketopiperazine analogs 60 63.

Among tested compounds in both U 937 and HeLa cells the homodimers are the most potent compounds IC U 937 0.18 nM IC HeLa 0.09 nM with the N1 N1 benzenesulfonylated analog 14 of 12 12 dideoxyverticillin A 3 showing the best activity IC U 937 0.18 nM IC HeLa 0.09 nM. Monomeric ETP derivatives also show good activity in both HeLa IC 5.9 nM and U 937 IC 2.8 nM human cancer cell lines. Within the N1 benzenesulfonyl monomeric class various aromatic substituents indol 3 yl 26 N Boc indol 3 yl 24 pyrrol 3 yl 32 p MeO phenyl 33 are well tolerated at the C3 position and their IC s are of the same order of magnitude IC U 937 2.8 14.8 nM IC HeLa 22 75 nM. Halide substitution at C3 bromide 30 fluorides 31 and 35 results in intermediately good activity. While not wishing to be limited by theory Applicant notes that in some embodiments the steric environment of the C3 position may be crucial for biological activity n alkyl groups at that position n propyl analogs 61 and 65 lead to substantially lower potencies than more sterically hindered hetero aryl and halide substituents or the C3 quaternary carbon of a second monomeric subunit and the dimers in some embodiments have better activity than hetero arylated monomers. In some embodiments dimers containing two sulfur bridge groups are one order of magnitude more potent than monomeric C3 3 indolyl analogs and 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more potent than heterodimers bearing a single sulfur bridge. This non linear increase of biological activity between mono and dimeric ETP compounds was also observed in other families. While not wishing to be limited by theory Applicant notes that the observation may suggest a synergistic effect pharmacokinetic properties could also play a role.

Comparing homodimers 12 12 dideoxyverticillin A 3 chaetocin A 4 chaetocin C 5 and 12 12 dideoxychetracin A 6 head to head reveals that in some embodiments the chaetocin type ETP derivatives are more potent than their non C15 hydroxylated counterparts IC U 937 0.75 1.3 nM vs. 15.5 nM IC HeLa 5.6 6.9 nM vs. 7.2 nM. In some embodiments acetylation of the 17 17 hydroxyl groups 15 16 also results in a reduction of potency 5.8 to 12.9 fold for U 937 2.0 to 11.1 fold for HeLa . Methyl substitution at C15 in monomeric alkaloids Trp Ala cyclo dipeptides 60 vs. 26 and 64 vs. 36 affects the potency of the compounds moderately in the test. Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that the difference in potency between the different types of substituents at C15 may be generally minimal although it could be sensitive to variations of the steric environment. In some embodiments the present invention provides a method of optimizing an ETP compound or a derivative of an analog thereof comprising modifying substituents at the C15 position. In some embodiments a provided method is used to optimize the pharmacokinetic parameters during drug development. In some embodiments a compound of formula I a I b I c or I d is connected to L through C15 or a substituent on C15.

In some embodiments the present invention discovered that substitution at N1 and N1 with electron withdrawing groups such as benzenesulfonyl 14 or trifluoroacetyl 17 groups enhanced the anticancer activity of the alkaloids. For example sulfonyl group 14 dramatically increased the potency 2 orders of magnitude more potent than the corresponding secondary aniline 12 12 dideoxyverticillin A 3 . The trifluoroacetamide at N1 and N1 17 vs. 16 also enhanced the anticancer activity. For the monomeric ETP containing analogs the N1 benzenesulfonyl substitution also amplifies the anticancer effect in U 937 cell line epidisulfide 26 vs. 10 epitrisulfide 27 vs. 29 . Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that the N1 group could confer significantly higher chemical stability and may also affect the pharmacodynamic properties of these ETP compounds.

In some embodiments the present invention demonstrated that sulfuration at only the tryptophan C position is not sufficient for potent activity bis trisulfanes 19 and 20 C11 thioesters 50 51 C11 thioether 49 and C11 thiols 47 48 . In some embodiments a provided method for optimizing an ETP compound or derivatives or analogs thereof comprises maintaining or installing sulfurization at both C position of the diketopiperazine ring e.g. C11 and C15 . In some embodiments both amino acid C positions have sulfuration by separate sulfur atoms.

In some embodiments sulfur derivatives possessing non labile alkyl groups S methylthioethers 7 and 39 S methoxymethyl thioethers 40 41 S 2 ethoxyethoxymethyl thioether 42 and 47 S benzylthioether 43 did not display any anticancer activity IC 10 M . Thioacetal 38 were active. In some embodiments the degree of sulfuration of the polysulfide bridge dimers chaetocin A 4 vs. chaetocin C 5 vs. 12 12 dideoxychetracin A 6 or 15 vs. 16 monomers 10 vs. 29 26 vs. 27 vs. 28 has no substantial impact on cell death induction in some embodiments the ICvalues are within the margin of error of each other.

In addition to ETP containing compounds several monomeric or dimeric derivatives provided by the present invention possessing modifications directly on the sulfur bridge are competent anticancer agents. Exemplary derivative compounds include thioacetate 44 dithiocarbonate 37 trithiocarbonates 18 36 64 and alkyl disulfides 45 46 . Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that certain derivatives could be readily converted to the thiols for example the methyl disulfides would readily be converted to the thiols through reduction or nucleophilic displacement. While not wishing to be limited by theory Applicant notes that the data could suggest a mode of action that involves a common intermediate in the presence of a reducing cytoplasmic environment combined with the presence of enzymes hydrolases carboxylesterases and lipases W. Kroutil A. A. St mpfli R. Dahinden M. J rg U. Miller and J. P. Pachlatko 2002 58 2589 methyl disulfides thioacetates and thiocarbonates could play the role of prodrugs a C. A. Fink J. E. Carlson P. A. McTaggart Y. Qiao R. Webb R. Chatelain A. Y. Jeng and A. J. Trapani 1996 39 3158 b B. Testa and J. M. Mayer Wiley VCH Weinheim 2003 c J. Rautio H. Kumpulainen T. Heimbach R. Oliyai D. Oh T. J rvinen and J. Savolainen 2008 7 255 . Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that these compounds may be converted to their corresponding epidisulfide pharmacophores which could be potentially actively concentrated within the cell via a glutathione dependent uptake mechanism a P. H. Bernardo N. Brasch C. C. L. Chai and P. Waring 2003 278 46549 and b C. S. Sevier and C. A. Kaiser 2002 3 836 . In some embodiments compounds with the sulfur bridge on the face of the DKP 34 62 63 66 67 are inactive.

Certain provided compounds were tested in culture against a panel of three supplementary human cancer cell lines representing three additional tumor histologies H460 lung carcinoma 786 O renal carcinoma MCF 7 breast carcinoma . As shown in Table E1 2 the ETPs retain their potency across the cell lines. In some embodiments a provided compound is active in all cell lines. In some embodiments a provide compound can be used to selectively target certain cells and or cancers. For example compound 14 retains high levels of activity in all of the cell lines while compound 17 is more active toward some of the cell lines. Without the intention to be limited Applicant notes that certain cell lines could be more sensitive to provided compounds for example U 937 and HeLa are slightly more sensitive to the ETPs than the other three cell lines.

The polysulfide dimers 12 12 dideoxyverticillin A 3 chaetocins A 4 and C 5 12 12 dideoxychetracin A 6 14 and bisdithiepanethione 18 are active across the board. In the case of the N1 N1 benzenesulfonylated analog of 12 12 dideoxyverticillin A 14 the potency is dramatically increased 2 orders of magnitude more potent than with the addition of the benzenesulfonyl group.

In some embodiments the degree of sulfuration has a larger impact in some of the adherent cell lines tested H460 786 O and MCF 7 especially in the case of 26 28. In some embodiments this set of compounds shows a 2 fold decrease in activity with each additional sulfur atom in the polysulfide bridge. Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that lack of substitution at N1 10 and 29 and dimers 4 6 mitigates this effect.

Bisthioacetate 44 trithiocarbonate 36 and dithiocarbonate 37 display lower activity than the corresponding epidisulfide 26 but are active toward the cell lines. These compounds show consistently lower ICvalues than epidisulfide 10 up to 6.7 fold more potent . In some embodiments a provided compound displayed different activity across cell lines. C3 pyrrolyl 32 and C3 p methoxyphenyl 33 epidisulfides displayed a consistent potency 4 fold change in activity as compared to 6 to 40 fold changes for other derivatives in addition to good relative potency in H460 cells.

The exemplary compounds were evaluated for their ability to induce hemolysis in human erythrocytes at concentrations well above their anticancer IC50 values. As shown in the compounds show no hemolytic activity. The concentrations at which hemolytic activity was assessed 1 and 10 M are in some cases over 1000 fold higher than the IC50 values for cancer cells.

Compounds 5 14 26 and 33 were examined for their ability to induce caspase dependent apoptotic pathway on U 937 cells. The induction of apoptosis was first evaluated by the level of phosphatidylserine externalization detected by FITC conjugated Annexin V AnnV that occurs prior to the disruption of cell membrane integrity detected by propidium iodide PI . The progression of cells through the AnnV PI quadrant lower right demonstrates the ability of both monomeric and dimeric ETP containing derivatives to induce apoptosis.

Another marker of apoptosis is the cleavage patterns of various intracellular proteins. Caspase 3 one of the key apoptotic executioner caspases is activated from its low Page activity zymogen procaspase 3 at an early stage of apoptosis. This activation was visualized by Western blot by the cleavage of procaspase 3 35 kDa to caspase 3 12 and 17 kDa . Caspase 3 in turn cleaves one of its cellular substrates PARP 1. Treating cells with the four ETP derivatives followed by Western blotting for procaspase 3 caspase 3 and PARP 1 revealed that all these compounds induce cleavage of procaspase 3 and PARP 1. Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that data in indicate that these ETP derivatives may induce caspase dependent apoptotic cell death.

The present invention provides methods and compounds that enable structural activity relationship study. Some of the results were presented below in Scheme E1 4.

Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that some human cancer cell lines were most responsive to variations in functionalization at the C3 and C11 C15 centers while displaying a more modest response to modification at the N1 and Cpositions. Again without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that compounds may be highly potent if the diketopiperazines were sulfurated at the C11 C15 sites in a manner consistent with a species capable of being converted to an epidisulfide on the same face of the hexahydropyrrolo 1 2 a pyrazine 1 4 dione moiety as N1 in the biological milieu. In some embodiments the anticancer potencies of this collection of compounds correlate positively with the steric environment at the C3 position rendering the dimeric ETP alkaloids in certain cases the most potent with sub nanomolar IC s against a range of human cancer cell lines. Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that the muted sensitivity of these cell lines to variations in N1 and Csubstitution make these ideal sites for compound optimization. In some embodiments despite their attenuated activity a lower molecular weight monomers may prove to have more optimal pharmacokinetic properties and provide further avenues for molecular modification in the optimization and development of small molecule drugs.

At least three numbering systems for dimeric diketopiperazine alkaloids exist in the literature a Von Hauser D. Weber H. P. Sigg H. P. 1970 53 1061. b Barrow C. J. Cai P. Snyder J. K. Sedlock D. M. Sun H. H. Cooper R. 1993 58 6016. c Springer J. P. B chi G. Kobbe B. Demain A. L. Clardy J. 1977 28 2403 . In assigning the H and C NMR data of all intermediates en route to our different naturally occurring ETPs and their synthetic analogs a uniform numbering scheme was to employed. For ease of direct comparison particularly between early intermediates non thiolated diketopiperazines and advanced compounds the numbering system used by Barrow for WIN 64821 using positional numbers 1 21 is optimal and used throughout this report. In key instances the products are accompanied by the numbering system as shown below.

Cells were grown in media supplemented with fetal bovine serum FBS and antibiotics 100 g mL penicillin and 100 U mL streptomycin . Specifically experiments were performed using the following cell lines and media compositions U 937 HeLa H460 and 786 O RPMI 1640 10 FBS and MCF7 EMEM 10 FBS . Cells were incubated at 37 C. in a 5 CO 95 humidity atmosphere.

The cell suspensions were transferred to 1.5 mL tubes and pelleted 600 g 3 min . The media was removed via aspiration and the cells were lysed by adding 40 L of RIPA buffer 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 150 mM NaCl 1 TX 100 0.5 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS with 1 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a general method for preparing epidithiodiketopiperazine alkaloids for example a provided compound of formulae I a I b I c and I d by using 3 hydroxytryptophan in lieu of tryptophan as our feedstock material.

In some embodiments an exemplary synthesis of bionectins A and C commenced with the development of a concise and scalable route to erythro hydroxytryptophan Scheme E2 2 . While several methods have been reported for the synthesis of the threo diastereomer a H. Sugiyama T. Shioiri and F. Yokokawa 2002 43 3489 b S. J. Wen H. W. Zhang and Z. J. Yao 2002 43 5291 c K. S. Feldman and A. G. Karatjas 2004 6 2489 d S. J. Wen and Z. J. Yao 2004 6 2721 e D. Crich and A. Banerjee 2006 71 7106 f D. B. Hansen A. S. Lewis S. J. Gavalas and M. M. Joulli 2006 17 15 g J. Patel G. Clav P. Y. Renard and X. Franck 2008 47 4224 there was no scalable available method to the desired tryptophan derivative. After extensive optimization it was surprisingly found that titanium IV mediated anti aldol reaction A. Solladi Cavallo and J. L. Koessler 1994 59 3240 b A. Solladie Cavallo and T. Nsenda 1998 39 2191 c A. Teniou and H. Alliouche 2006 18 2487 to indole 3 carboxaldehyde E2 10 and pinanone derived ethyl iminogylcinate E2 11 T. Oguri N. Kawai T. Shioiri and S. i. Yamada 1978 26 803 efficiently afforded the aldol adducts in some embodiments in 81 yield on greater than 40 gram scale. Subsequent hydrolysis of the Schiff base then afforded greater than 20 grams of hydroxy amino ester E2 13 in 94 ee along with recovery of the chiral auxiliary. The absolute and relative stereochemistry of the material were verified through single crystal X ray diffraction analysis of its 3 5 dinitrobenzamide derivative E2 14.

With a rapid and scalable route to erythro hydroxytryptophan available we proceeded to the synthesis of the desired tetracycle E2 16. Dipeptide formation with N Boc scarcosine followed by unveiling of the amine and intramolecular cyclization with AcOH and morpholine in tert butanol afforded diketopiperazine E2 15 in 97 yield. Exposure of diketopiperazine E2 15 to excess bromine in MeCN at 0 C. and subsequent addition of anisole led to a diastereoselective halocyclization with concomitant loss of the silyl ether. In some embodiments in addition to preventing undesired ring halogenation quenching of excess bromine with anisole resulted in the in situ formation of hydrobromic acid which was responsible for the desired removal of the silyl ether function. Under these optimized conditions tetracyclic bromide E2 16 could be accessed in decagram quantities in 94 yield 9 1 dr endo exo favoring the desired diastereomer. In some embodiments we found that the C12 hydroxyl group favors the formation of the desired endo cyclization product independent of the ancillary amino acid substituent at the C15 center.

Using the tetracyclic bromide we tried to implement an intermolecular Friedel Crafts indolylation at the C3 position in a manner akin to gliocladin synthesis however without the intention to be limited by theory due to the inductive effects of the C12 hydroxyl group Scheme E2 3 we found the C3 bromide proved recalcitrant toward ionization. Under more forcing conditions C3 carbocation derivatives E2 18 could be formed but their instability required rapid trapping a feat in some embodiments hindered by the additional substitution at C12. Application of the conditions for intermolecular Friedel Crafts reaction a J. Kim and M. Movassaghi 2011 133 14940 b N. Boyer and M. Movassaghi 2012 3 1798 resulted in regioisomeric and diastereomeric products Scheme E2 3 . In some embodiments the geometry of the tricyclic substructure was insufficient in overcoming the steric pressures imposed by C12 hydroxylation resulting in 10 undesired byproducts consistent with indole addition from the concave face.

After examining a variety of strategies it was surprisingly found that an intramolecular delivery of the indole fragment provided the desired product efficiently. Silylation of tetracyclic alcohol with chlorodimethyl N Boc 2 indole silane E2 20 S. E. Denmark and J. D. Baird 2004 6 3649 provided the desired silyl tethered indole adduct E2 21 in 74 yield Scheme E2 4 . Surprisingly a silver mediated intramolecular Friedel Crafts reaction proceeded smoothly in nitroethane at 0 C. to afford the C3 3 indolyl silacyclic product E2 22 in 68 yield. The structure of a diethyl silyl variant E2 23 was confirmed through X ray analysis Scheme E2 4 . The desired C3 indolylated tetracycle E2 24 was accessed in 58 yield by treatment of silacyclic product E2 22 with aqueous hydrochloric acid.

The key indolylated intermediate E2 24 was subsequently bis tert butoxycarbonyl protected in 92 yield using BocO and DMAP in anticipation of our C H hydroxylation chemistry. In some embodiments the hydroxylation proceeded effectively in the presence of less electron rich substructures Scheme E2 4 . In some embodiments the oxidation was more efficient with the tert butoxycarbonyl group on N1 on this system. Surprisingly rather than providing the expected stereoretentive dihydroxylation product Scheme E2 1 in some embodiments oxidation of the tetracycle with excess bis pyridine silver I permanganate in dichloromethane afforded triketopiperazine 25 in 45 yield as a single diastereomer representing an average of 77 yield per oxidation event. Direct access to a triketopiperazine motif is a highly enabling transformation and can be used to preparation C 15 derivatives for example as described in J. E. DeLorbe D. Home R. Jove S. M. Mennen S Nam F. L. Zhang and L. E. Overman 2013 135 4117.

The C15 carbonyl group of triketopiperazine E2 25 was reduced in a highly diastereoselective fashion using sodium borohydride in methanol at 20 C. to afford the desired diol E2 27 in 75 yield Scheme E2 4 . The relative stereochemistries of the C11 and C15 alcohols were then verified by peracetylation of a C12 acetylated diol derivative followed by single crystal X ray diffraction analysis of the resultant triacetate E2 28. Surprisingly the C11 stereochemistry is consistent with hydroxylation with inversion of the originating C H stereochemistry an event unprecedented in other oxidations of diketopiperazines without C12 hydroxylation a J. Kim J. A. Ashenhurst and M. Movassaghi 2009 324 238 b J. Kim and M. Movassaghi 2010 132 14376. c N. Boyer and M. Movassaghi 2012 3 1798 . While not wishing to be limited by theory Applicant notes that it is likely that the captodatively stabilized radical resulting from permanganate mediated C H abstraction is sterically shielded by the C12 tert butoxycarbonate group preventing the subsequent hydroxylation step through a rapid rebound mechanism K. A. Gardner and J. M. Mayer 1995 269 1849 b T. Strassner and K. N. Houk 2000 122 7821 reaction of a permanganate molecule with the persistent stereochemically labile carbon centered radical on the opposite face of the diketopiperazine would afford the oxidation product.

In some embodiments recognizing the C11 and C15 alcohols to be recalcitrant toward ionization by virtue of their proximity to an inductively withdrawing carbonate and their location on a secondary carbon respectively the hydroxyl groups were activated for ionization by acylation with pivaloyl chloride and DMAP in dichloromethane to provide dipivaloate E2 27 in 83 yield. Constraining our search to functional groups capable of withstanding conditions for the photoinduced reductive removal of a benzenesulfonyl group we initially evaluated the use of thioacid and alkyl mercaptan nucleophiles. While thioacids resulted in categorically low levels of diastereoselection for the nucleophilic addition alkyl mercaptans proved highly diastereoselective on this substrate in affording their bisthioether adduct. However known thioether reagents such as 2 cyanoethyl and 2 trimethylsilylethyl mercaptans required intolerably harsh conditions for their conversion to the necessary thiols.

In some embodiments the present invention provides new sulphide surrogates and new methods for sulfidation. We generated 4 mercaptobutan 2 one E2 29 N. C. Ross and R. Levine J. Org. Chem. 1964 29 2346 by addition of hydrogen sulphide to methyl vinyl ketone and 3 mercaptopropiophenone E2 30 by addition of thioacetic acid to 3 chloropropiophenone followed by hydrolysis. Exposure of several diketopiperazine derived bishemiaminals to trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile gratifyingly resulted in diastereoselective cis thioether adducts Table E2 1 . While the additions were highly diastereoselective using either of our thiol reagents on our bisproline substrate in some embodiments mercaptan E2 30 afforded superior diastereoselectivities to mercaptan E2 29 on other substrates including the diol presursor to bisthioether E2 33. In some embodiments bisthioether adducts of methylketone based mercaptan E2 29 underwent pyrrolidine catalyzed sulfide cleavage at a faster rate and was better suited for use with more sensitive compounds such as substrate E2 27.

The bisthioethers generated using this new method could be converted to the corresponding epidithiodiketopiperazine under exceedingly mild conditions. Addition of pyrrolidine to a solution of the adducts in acetonitrile under an atmosphere of oxygen resulted in the direct conversion of substrates E2 31 E2 33 to their corresponding disulphides Table E2 1 . In the event that a dithiol cannot be oxidized readily with molecular oxygen to the disulphide in order to drive the addition elimination equilibriation process toward product formation a sacrificial thiol can be added to the reaction mixture to effect a transthioetherification.

Indeed application of the provided new methodology for sulfidation of diketopiperazines proved critical in the synthesis of bionectins A and C. Treatment of a solution of dipivaloate E2 27 and ketomercaptan reagent E2 29 with trifluoroacetic acid in nitromethane at 23 C. yielded a diastereomeric mixture of bisthioethers E2 36 in 80 yield and 3 1 dr with concomitant removal of the tert butoxycarbonyl groups at the N1 amine and C12 alcohol. While not wishing to be limited by theory Applicant notes that ionization at C11 did not occur in acetonitrile likely due to the inductive effects of the C12 hydroxy group. The major diastereomer possessed the desired C11 C15 stereochemistry and could be isolated in 56 yield upon photoinduced electron transfer mediated removal of the benzensulfonyl group T. Hamada A. Nishida and O. Yonemitsu 1986 108 140 . The bisthioethers were then removed with a mild enamine mediated transthioetherification protocol employing pyrrolidine and ethanethiol in THF. The use of a sacrificial thiol was surprisingly found to be optimal in the unveiling of the thiols exposure to an atmosphere of oxygen was insufficient in oxidizing the dithiol to a disulphide. Without the intention to be limited by theory Applicant notes that the C15 thiol may prefer an equatorial disposition in its ground state and that conformation may not be as conducive to oxidation by molecular oxygen. Mild oxidation with KIin pyridine then afforded the target compound bionectin A E2 1 in 81 yield.

We treated the synthetic sample of E2 1 with p nitrobenzoyl chloride and DMAP in CHClat 0 C. to afford bionectin A p nitrobenzoate E2 38 in 98 yield. Single crystal X ray diffraction analysis of this C12 p nitrobenzoate derivative confirmed its structure. Reductive methylation of bionectin A E2 1 with sodium borohydride and MeI in pyridine and methanol afforded bionectin C E2 2 in 97 yield H. Poisel and U. Schmidt 1971 104 1714 .

At least three numbering systems for dimeric diketopiperazine alkaloids exist in the literature a Von Hauser D. Weber H. P. Sigg H. P. 1970 53 1061. b Barrow C. J. Cai P. Snyder J. K. Sedlock D. M. Sun H. H. Cooper R. 1993 58 6016. c Springer J. P. B chi G. Kobbe B. Demain A. L. Clardy J. 1977 28 2403. d Zheng C. J. Kim C. J. Bae K. S. Kim Y. H. Kim W. G 2006 69 1816. e DeLorbe J. E. Jabri S. Y. Mennen S. M. Overman L. E. Zhang F. L. 2011 133 6549 . In assigning the H and C NMR data of all intermediates en route to our total syntheses of bionectins A E2 1 and C E2 2 we wished to employ a uniform numbering scheme. For ease of direct comparison particularly between early intermediates non thiolated diketopiperazines and advanced compounds the numbering system used by Barrow for WIN 64821 using positional numbers 1 21 is optimal and used throughout this report. In key instances the products are accompanied by the numbering system as shown below.
