title: Remote console access in a scalable cloud computing environment
abstract: A scalable cloud infrastructure serves two or more customers, where each customer is associated with at least one unit of virtual resources. The virtual resources are established by apportioning physical resources in the cloud infrastructure that are partitioned into pods within one or more zones in a scalable manner. Additionally, the cloud infrastructure establishes one or more management server clusters each comprising one or more management servers. The two or more customers create a number of virtual machines within pods in a zone. Due to the scalability of the cloud infrastructure, a console proxy virtual machine and server is introduced to support console access to virtual machines. The console proxy server serves as an intermediary between a browser and a viewed virtual machine configured to maintain viewing session quality while minimizing network impact.

This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. 120 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 020 801 filed on Feb. 3 2011 which is a non provisional under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Patent Application No. 61 301 168 filed on Feb. 3 2010 both these applications being incorporated by reference herein.

This disclosure generally relates to cloud computing and more particularly to enabling infrastructure information technology services including computing storage and networking services to be provisioned on demand and delivered over the Internet in a scalable manner.

Service providers and enterprises have traditionally relied on large local installations of commodity data center hardware including computing storage and networking devices to provide information technology services and applications to their users. The advent of computing services that enable applications to run in the cloud or on remote data centers that provision computing storage and networking services to applications has left many service providers and enterprises with a large inventory of unused commodity data center hardware.

A cloud infrastructure provides on demand computing resources to a customer whether an individual or an enterprise of the cloud operator through virtualization. The customer typically is physically remote from the computing resource and is agnostic to the location of the physical resources that support the computing resources. In a virtualized cloud infrastructure the computing resource generally comprises a virtual machine characterized by some amount of processor memory storage networking capability or capacity. Virtualization allows the physical resources support a large number of computing resources often well beyond the limited number of actual physical devices. Physical resources in the cloud infrastructure are shared amongst the different customers of the cloud infrastructure. Each customer gets the illusion of operating a physically distinct computing resource.

Traditional virtualization infrastructure is built on shared storage and shared Layer 2 Data Link networking. These requirements severely limit scalability of conventional cloud systems. In shared storage the physical disks may be physically separate from the computing server. These disks are typically controlled by a dedicated computer known as a storage controller or storage server. The storage controller provides access to the physical server via network protocols such as NFS and iSCSI. The virtual machines therefore access their storage over the network but in a transparent fashion such that their storage appears to be locally attached. Each storage server provides storage to multiple physical servers. The virtual machines access their virtual disks over the network via a hypervisor deployed on the physical servers hosting the virtual machines. The hypervisor is responsible for managing the virtual machines access to the storage servers.

When the storage is networked in such a fashion it may provide many advantages to the cloud operator. However a typical infrastructure cloud is characterized by massive scale with hundreds or thousands of customers operating thousands of virtual machines simultaneously with each customer getting the illusion of operating physically distinct computers. To support such scale the operator needs to deploy hundreds of physical servers and the networking elements and storage to support these physical servers.

While advantageous as outlined above commercially available storage servers are not the ideal solution. The storage servers may not scale sufficiently to support such deployments due to architectural limitations. They may be prohibitively expensive or represent more capital outlay than warranted by the initial anticipated demand for the service. They may present single points of failure or increased cost due to deployment of redundant elements. Insurmountable performance bottlenecks may be present for example due to the limits of networking speed. Expensive large centralized storage may require long term technology and vendor lock in detrimental to the competitiveness of the cloud operator.

The networking elements may provide a similar challenge in large scale cloud deployments. Typically the network between the physical servers is provided by switched Ethernet since it provides performance at optimal price points. However interconnecting all physical servers using Layer 2 switching has a number of drawbacks.

First each physical server uses broadcasts and multicasts to discover services and advertise services on the network. As the number of physical servers increases to accommodate a growing number of virtual machines the amount of broadcast traffic scales accordingly. Broadcast traffic is detrimental to the performance of the network since each server is interrupted by every broadcast even if it is not relevant to the server. Commercially available network switches can often only support a few dozen physical ports each physical server is connected to one or more ports. Switches can be linked together with high speed switches but at great expense and potentially lower reliability.

Additionally previous virtualization technologies resorted to one of two approaches physical host based network virtualization using software drivers integrated in the hypervisor or physical network VLAN based network virtualization either via port based VLANs or IEEE 802.1q tagged Ethernet frames. The popular IEEE 802.1Q standard defines a 12 bit tag which allows more than 4000 VLANs to be supported within a broadcast domain. But neither of these approaches by themselves are sufficient to build a scalable cloud infrastructure.

In a cloud infrastructure physical resources are partitioned into pods within one or more zones in a scalable manner. The physical resources comprise physical compute storage and networking resources within data centers distributed across a network. Each zone comprises a subset of the pods and is physically isolated from other zones in the plurality. Each pod comprises a discrete set of physical resources in a zone which resources are tightly connected via a communications network. The physical resources across pods are weakly connected via a communications network in contrast to the physical resources within pods. Additionally the cloud infrastructure establishes one or more management server clusters each comprising one or more management servers. In one embodiment resources are strongly connected by physical and data link level protocols and weakly connected by network or higher level protocols. In another embodiment resources are strongly connected by having relatively low latency and or high bandwidth network links between them and weakly connected by having high latency and or low bandwidth network link between them.

The cloud infrastructure serves two or more customers with authenticated accounts. Each customer is associated with units of virtual resources on the cloud infrastructure. The cloud infrastructure establishes units of virtual resources by apportioning selected sets of the physical resources within the pods. The apportioned physical resources may be shared between two or more of the units of virtual resources. Each management server is configured for allocating the units of virtual resources to an account associated with each customer.

The cloud infrastructure comprises one or more data networks built from the distributed networking resources. A data network connects the pods and is configured for routing traffic to the pods from the customers of the cloud infrastructure and vice versa. The cloud infrastructure also comprises establishing one or more management networks. A management network connects the management servers to one of the zones and connects the compute and storage resources partitioned within the pod.

A console proxy virtual machine facilitates and handles a multitude of customer viewing sessions on console proxy servers for a number of virtual machines belonging to the customer. Embodiments include a Domain Name System herein DNS translation technique within a virtual computing network the implementation of console proxy servers and the use of image stripes to communicate display updates during customer viewing sessions to a device.

The DNS server translation technique facilitates the on demand launch and termination of console proxy virtual machines to manage physical resources while supporting customer viewing sessions.

In one embodiment console proxy servers establish a viewing session and receive virtual machine display changes. An image stripe contains a number of image tiles which are changed portions of a virtual machine display combined into a single image. Image stripes also include mapping information to facilitate application of the contained tiles at their corresponding locations. The image stripe is then communicated to the customer device. The customer device extracts the image tiles and associated location information from the image stripes. Then the customer device applies and displays the tiles as to create an updated view of the virtual machine display.

The use of image stripes reduces the volume of network traffic requests and enables console proxy viewing session traffic to traverse firewalls with allowed network protocols such as HTTP. The DNS server and console proxy virtual machines also enhance the scalability of virtual machine environments and provide a manageable and scalable number of viewing sessions while reducing associated network traffic with image stripe display updates.

The features and advantages described in this summary and the following detailed description are not all inclusive. Many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims hereof.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments of the present invention s examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. It is noted that wherever practicable similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality.

The present invention improves the organization and utilization of data center hardware to provide a scalable cloud infrastructure by building a system of small blocks within data centers and connecting the physical servers across data centers using high speed networks. illustrate the overall framework for the scalable cloud infrastructure.

Each pod is a self contained physical grouping of servers that acts as a management unit for the scalable cloud infrastructure. Each pod includes a discrete i.e. non overlapping set of the physical resources in the zone . The physical resources in each pod have strong connectivity with each other and weak connectivity with the physical resources outside the pod. The strong connectivity and weak connectivity refer to the latency for traffic between connected physical resources. The latency for traffic may be determined by many different factors.

In one embodiment strong connectivity and weak connectivity may be switching of traffic between any two connected physical resources on a particular layer of a standard for instance the OSI model. As an example strong connectivity may imply Layer 2 switching. Similarly weak connectivity may imply layer 3 or higher layer switching. In another embodiment strong connectivity and weak connectivity may be based on the bandwidth available for traffic between the connected physical resources. As an example strong connectivity may be implemented by provisioning a minimum of 10 GHz links between the connected physical resources. Similarly weak connectivity may be implemented by a minimum of 1 GHz links between the connected physical resources. Additionally geographic proximity may also be used to define strong connectivity and weak connectivity. It is possible that geographically distant physical resources have a higher latency for traffic than geographically closer physical resources.

The discrete set of physical resources in a pod may be based on the anticipated processor memory network and storage requirements of potential customers of resources within a zone . For example a customer s storage and network requirements can be significant. Given a specification of resources e.g. an average and peak throughput in terms of input output operations per second IOPS and assuming that that throughput is to be divided equally amongst the devices e.g. virtual machines in a pod then the IOPS capacity of the servers determines an overall total number of virtual machines for a pod . If each server within the pod can host a specified number of virtual machines then a pod could be sized accordingly in terms of the number of servers storage and networking requirements.

The pods can be coupled with any number of other pods using Layer 3 switching thereby enabling unlimited scaling of the number of customers using the scalable cloud infrastructure. The pods allow the scalable cloud infrastructure to be built from smaller units of management and without a large up front hardware investment.

Typically the management server cluster is deployed as a primary management server cluster in a first datacenter with a back up management server cluster installation at a second datacenter

In one embodiment data stored by the first management cluster is replicated and transmitted for storage by the second management cluster . In response to a failure of the first management cluster the domain name system DNS records are updated in the servers in the zones such that network traffic that would normally be directed to the first management server cluster instead is directed to the second management server cluster . Thus operation of the servers in the zones is unaffected by failure of the first management server cluster . The two management server clusters are isolated from one another by residing in different data centers to minimize the likelihood of simultaneous failure of the management server clusters .

It is within the architectural framework of that the scalable cloud infrastructure is further described herein.

The administrator or operator of the cloud infrastructure deploys the various resources as discussed above. In one embodiment the operator of the cloud infrastructure is distinct from one or more providers of the resources e.g. a provider may own any number of virtual machines that will be used by the administrator in the cloud infrastructure. In one embodiment the provider owns a large number of servers .

One or more customers are users of portions of the resources of the cloud infrastructure. The term customer may refer to either the device or the user entity or person . Customers access the resources associated with their respective customer accounts and are connected to the resources via the network . Details of customer account resource allocation and access to those resources are discussed further in conjunction with .

The management server cluster is a cluster of management servers and their associated database . As indicated in conjunction with the management server cluster serves multiple zones and pods within data centers . The management server cluster also maintains customer account information. For example the management server cluster may establish virtual machines units of virtual resources by apportioning the physical resources within the pods to each of the units. The physical resources may be shared between two or more of the virtual machines. Although one management server cluster is depicted multiple management server clusters may be distributed throughout the cloud infrastructure each serving a plurality of data centers and zones . The details of the management server cluster are described further in conjunction with .

Each management server allocates and manages use of the physical resources within one or more zones . For example management server manages the resources in zone management server manages the resources in zone and management server manages the resources in zone . A management network may connect each of the management servers to a zone and may also connect the physical resources within the pod . A management server can allocate to and manage units of virtual resources associating customer accounts with the physical resources in a zone associated with that management server . The details of the management server are described further in conjunction with . The database can be any database commonly used for storage. According to one embodiment the database is a MySQL database.

The data centers zones and pods were described briefly in conjunction with . Switching within the zones typically is Layer 3 switching while switching within the pods typically is Layer 2 switching providing unlimited scaling of the cloud infrastructure. Zones are described in greater detail in conjunction with pods are described in greater detail in conjunction with and the servers in each pod are described further in conjunction with

The zone layer switch manages the network traffic to and from the pods within the zone and comprises one or more Layer 3 L3 i.e. network layer switches. For a zone comprising the servers in a small data center a pair of L3 switches may suffice. For large data centers high end core switches may implement core routing capabilities and include line cards that support firewall capabilities. A router redundancy protocol like VRRP also may be deployed. Traffic within the zone and or pods also is switched at other levels of either the OSI model or other networking models as described further below.

One embodiment of the zone layer switch supports two internal networks within the zone a data network and a management network . The data network is used to carry traffic to and from the zone from customers and other entities on the network . For example operation of virtual machines implemented on the servers within the pods of the zone e.g. if a virtual machine within the zone issues an HTTP request over the network both the HTTP request and any associated HTTP response will be routed via the data network .

The management network is used to carry traffic to and from the zone from the management server cluster and individual management servers within the management server cluster as well as traffic generated internally within the zone . Each pod in the zone is communicatively coupled to both the data network and the management network .

All traffic in and out of the zone passes through a firewall . The firewall may comprise one or more network firewalls specific to each internal network . The firewall provides connection to the public network space i.e. network and is configured in routing mode.

In one embodiment the firewall operates in a transparent mode for the data network such that the data network comprises the same IP address space as the public Internet. For example if the data network utilizes public IP addresses the zone is assigned a unique set of IP addresses that do not overlap with the IP addresses assigned to other zones .

In one embodiment the firewall operates in a network address translation NAT mode for the management network . For example the zone can be assigned an IP address in the 192.168.0.0 16 Class B private address space and each pod within the zone can be assigned an IP address in the 192.168. .0 24 Class C private address space the firewall remaps between the two address spaces as data is sent to or from the pods within the zone . Hence it is possible for the pods of different zones to have overlapping or identical private IP addresses. In some embodiments the firewall is outside of the zone such that it filters traffic to both the zone and the management server cluster . In some embodiments the firewall enables site to site VPN such that servers in different zones can reach each other within a virtual private network.

The routing servers are configured primarily to provide networking for computer data by the inclusion of suitable networking hardware network interfaces networking ports and the like . The routing servers can be implemented using any manner of suitable networking hardware and software and in some instances are combined with computing servers .

The storage servers are implemented as any device or combination of devices capable of persistently storing data in non transitory computer readable storage media such as a hard disk drive RAM a writable compact disk CD or DVD a solid state memory device or other optical magnetic storage mediums. Other types of computer readable storage mediums can be used and it is expected that as new storage mediums are developed in the future they can be configured in accordance with the teachings here. In addition the storage servers support local or distributed databases for storing customer information in one embodiment the database are MySQL databases.

Typically single uniform storage servers do not scale to more than a few dozen servers. A system architecture using pods however allows multiple smaller storage servers to be associated with each pod . Pod level shared storage delivers the benefit of shared storage such as the ability to restart virtual machines on a server different than where the virtual machine last ran which provides the ability to start up shut down and reallocate available servers.

The computing servers host the virtual machines within the pod as will be discussed further in conjunction with . The computing servers may comprise computing routing and or storage servers having different processing memory storage and networking capabilities according to various embodiments and may perform all of the functions of routing servers in embodiments that exclude separate routing servers . Additionally the computing servers can utilize different data storage systems such as direct attached storage DAS network attached storage NAS or a storage area network SAN .

The pod layer switch switches network traffic into and out of the pod . The pod layer switch may comprise one or more pod layer switches. The pod layer switch typically is a Layer 2 switch but switching is also possible at other levels of either the OSI model or other networking models. In alternate embodiments the pod may implement internal networks in addition to or distinct from the data network and the management network .

In one embodiment a public switch may be used for public traffic e.g. traffic on the data network and a private switch for management traffic e.g. traffic on the management network . Storage traffic e.g. traffic between the computing servers and the storage servers via the private switch may be isolated from other traffic to avoid packet loss and delays that are common with regular TCP IP traffic and to protect the servers from potentially malicious Internet traffic. In addition the storage traffic may be directed over a higher speed switch to meet the higher performance demands of the storage system.

In one embodiment of the pod the pod layer switch es are duplicated for redundancy with each computing server connected to multiple switches. Further it should be noted that multiple layers of switches can be coupled to effectively form a pod layer switch with an increased number of ports.

In another embodiment of the pod design Virtual LANs VLANs are used to segment traffic while using a single pod layer switch . The pod layer switch may support quality of service guarantees for virtual machines within the pod the storage VLAN is then given the appropriate share of the available bandwidth on the switch to meet the IOPS requirements of such virtual machines.

The VLANs for the management public and storage traffic may be created before the pod is deployed into production by programming the pod layer switch using the usual management interfaces. The storage server is also configured to use the storage and management VLANs using the usual management interfaces of the storage server . In other embodiments more than one traffic type can be directed over a single switch while other traffic types can have their own separate switches. For example guest traffic which refers of traffic between the virtual machines of each customer may be segmented using VLANs and directed on the same switch as management traffic.

In one embodiment the multitenant hypervisor is implemented on the computing server as a set of computer executable instructions encoded onto a non transitory computer readable storage medium included in the computing server and executed by a processor included in the computing server . The multitenant hypervisor therefore can comprise for example a software layer that manages the physical computing elements e.g. processors memory network cards and interfaces data storage disks of the computing server . The virtual machines access and use these physical computing elements as dictated by the multitenant hypervisor . The multitenant hypervisor can alter the allocation and accessibility of computing elements within the computing server over time in response to changes in the number and configurations of hosted virtual machines . The changes in the number and configurations of hosted virtual machines may occur for example because the customers associated with the hosted virtual machines made such a request or changes have occurred at other virtual machines associated with the customer .

A number of virtual machines may run on the computing server . The virtual machine comprises an allocation of the computer hardware and computer software elements of the computing server . The virtual machine simulates a physical computing device and can be configured to perform any computing task via inclusion of appropriate computer hardware and or computer software elements therein. For example a virtual machine can simulate a physical computing device having a 1 GHz processor 1 GB of memory and a 16 GB hard drive.

A virtual machine is associated exclusively with a single customer . However a computing server may host a set of virtual machines each associated with different customers . For example in one customer may be associated with virtual machine where as another customer may be associated with virtual machine and

A single computing server simultaneously can host virtual machines associated with different customers but the multitenant hypervisor along with the associated management server manages the hosted virtual machines such that each virtual machine appears to the corresponding customer as a physically distinct and self contained computing device.

In one embodiment the virtual machine comprises a processing resource a memory resource a storage resource a networking resource and a user interaction resource . The resources of the virtual machine comprise allocations of the computer hardware and or computer software elements of the computing server according to the units of virtual resources designated for a given customer account. The processing resource comprises an allocation portion of one or more computer processors. The memory resource and the storage resource can comprise an allocation of any physical device or combination of physical devices capable of persistently storing computer data such as a hard disk drive random access memory RAM a writable compact disk CD or DVD a solid state memory device or other optical magnetic storage mediums. Other types of non transitory computer readable storage mediums can be used for the memory resource and or the storage resource and it is expected that as new storage mediums are developed in the future they can be configured in accordance with the teachings here. In one embodiment the memory resource provides operational memory and comprises a specified amount of RAM. The storage resource provides long term data storage and again can comprise any suitable type of non transitory computer readable storage medium such as one or more hard disk drives.

The networking resource comprises an allocation of computer networking hardware and software elements to enable the virtual machine to communicate with other networked entities over the management network . One or more IP addresses can be associated with the virtual machine and supported by the networking resource . Accordingly the networking resource can include any type of communication interface suitable for transmitting and receiving data over the network . For example the networking resource can comprise an Internet interface a serial interface a parallel interface a USB Universal Serial Bus interface an Ethernet interface a T1 interface a Bluetooth interface IEEE 802.11 interface IEEE 802.16 interface or any other type of wired or wireless communication interface.

The user interaction resource comprises hardware and software elements to enable the customer or administrator to interact with the virtual machine . For example the user interaction resource can provide display elements such as a graphical user interface GUI whereby either the customer or administrator can interact with and manage operation of the virtual machine . The user interaction resource can also support a keyboard and mouse or the like to further enable the customer or administrator to manage operation of the virtual machine .

In some embodiments the resources of the virtual machine are supported within a single computing device such as a server. In other embodiments portions of the virtual machine can be distributed among any number of physically separate computing devices that are communicatively coupled via the network . For example the storage resource can comprise multiple hard drives residing on multiple servers. Because the resources are communicatively coupled to one another the virtual machine appears to the customer to be a single computing device that includes the cumulative capabilities of the resources regardless of the actual physical location or distribution of any computer hardware or software elements associated with of the resources .

In some embodiments there is a specially designated virtual machine called the management domain that provides a standard set of commands to control the multitenant hypervisor for example to start and stop virtual machines and to control the networking stack of the multitenant hypervisor . In other embodiments the multitenant hypervisor is hosted by a host operating system and the virtual machines operate as processes of the operating system with the multitenant hypervisor providing isolation. The multitenant hypervisor ensures that the virtual machines share the physical resources of the compute host such as the processor memory network interfaces and storage. In some cases the multitenant hypervisor defers the operation and management of the network stack and storage interfaces to the management domain or host operating system.

The physical network interfaces are shared among the virtual machines by the multitenant hypervisor . In one embodiment the virtual machines get the illusion of possessing a standard physical network interface such as those provided by commercially available network interface cards. The multitenant hypervisor ensures that these virtual interfaces are connected to the underlying physical network interfaces of the compute host.

The cloud infrastructure comprises a management server interacting with agents that in turn interact with and control the multitenant hypervisor using its standard set of commands. In one embodiment there may be one agent running in each operating system or management domain on a server . In other embodiments one agent may interact with a group of servers whose multitenant hypervisors have been clustered using cluster management software. The agents are controlled by the management server .

The management server also interacts with the storage servers in order to create and destroy the virtual disks for the virtual machines. In one embodiment a special version of the agent known as the storage agent runs on the processor subsystem of the storage server to perform these activities. In another embodiment the management server uses the standard set of commands provided by the management server or its Application Programming Interface API to create and destroy virtual disks.

The storage server presents virtual disks to the computing server . In one embodiment the virtual disks are visible as networked file systems to the multitenant hypervisor . In another embodiment the virtual disks are presented as block devices to the multitenant hypervisor . The multitenant hypervisor ensures that these virtual disks are presented to the virtual machine while giving the illusion of locally attached storage to the virtual machines.

The multitenant hypervisor provides a standard set of commands that the agent uses. Some examples of the command set are start a virtual machine stop a virtual machine reboot a virtual machine add or remove a virtual disk for a virtual machine add or remove a virtual network interface for a virtual machine mount dismount a virtual disk from the storage server add or remove VLANs from the physical network interfaces of the server .

The agents collect information from the computing servers and storage servers and report to the management server . The management server maintains the reported information in database tables. The database includes for example the state of the multitenant hypervisor the state of the virtual machines the configuration of the networking stack such as configured VLANS explained subsequently in the description of IP addresses speeds and aggregations of the physical network interfaces storage resources visible from the compute server the capabilities of the multitenant hypervisor the capabilities of the storage server the capacity used and allocated size of the storage server statistics such as network traffic consumed by the virtual machine processor and memory usage of virtual machine.

The management server commands the agent to perform certain actions in response to actions by the cloud customer or cloud operator at the user interface or API. For example when a customer starts a virtual machine the management server may look up its table of servers and identify a server that has enough spare capacity to satisfy the requested processing memory and network resources for the virtual machine. The management server may also look up its table of virtual machines to verify if the virtual machine is already running or if its virtual disks already exist on a storage server . If the virtual machine is not already running or its virtual disks do not exist the management server may command the storage server or storage agent to create the disks.

The management agent then sends a start virtual machine instruction to the agent for the compute host chosen in step . In the start instruction are included information such as the portion of the physical processors to allocate to the virtual machine the virtual network interfaces to create for the virtual machine and their mapping to the physical interfaces and identification of the virtual disks to present to the virtual machine.

The agent may then instructs the multitenant hypervisor on the computing server or computing server in the example of to mount the virtual disks from the storage server create the virtual network interfaces and start the virtual machine with the desired processors memory network interfaces and disk. The agent verifies that the virtual machine has started using the hypervisor command set and reports the success to the management server . The management server updates its table of virtual machines with information about the virtual machine including the server it is running on.

The management network handles traffic associated with the multitenant hypervisor executed by the computing servers within the pods of the zone . Hence traffic on the management network may additionally comprise messages between a multitenant hypervisor and a virtual machine e.g. messages related to the allocation of the physical computing elements of the particular computing server to a particular virtual machine .

In an embodiment of the invention network and storage isolation may comprise isolation of data alone and not quality of service. In other embodiments the quality of service capabilities built into the multitenant hypervisor s as well as network and storage hardware may be used to support enhanced isolation.

Network bandwidth throttling is used to limit the rate of traffic from each virtual machine. The operator of the cloud infrastructure may configure the management server with the desired maximum network bandwidth for each virtual machine. The configuration can be done on a per service offering basis a per customer account basis or across the cloud. A management server includes this maximum in the start instructions sent down to the multitenant hypervisor when starting a virtual machine. The multitenant hypervisor uses a standard set of commands to limit the guest traffic from the new virtual machine.

Storage bandwidth throttling is used to limit the rate of storage traffic from each virtual machine while reading or writing to a virtual disk. The operator of the cloud infrastructure may configure the management server with the desired maximum IOPs bandwidth for each virtual machine. As before the configuration can be done on a per service offering basis a per consumer basis or across the cloud. The management server includes this maximum in the start instructions send down to the multitenant hypervisor when starting a virtual machine. The multitenant hypervisor uses a standard set of commands to limit the storage traffic from the new virtual machine to a maximum number of IOPS as defined by the operator of the cloud infrastructure.

The depicted management server cluster comprises three management servers two load balancers primary storage and backup storage . Other embodiments of a management server cluster may comprise different numbers of management servers and load balancers .

The management servers are communicatively coupled to the load balancers and the load balancers are communicatively coupled to the networks . Thus the management servers can transmit and receive data and commands via the networks through the load balancers . The load balancers distribute traffic from the networks and associated workload among the management servers to optimize utilization of the management servers . In some embodiments the load balancers comprise dedicated hardware devices e.g. multilayer hardware switching devices or severs configured to provide load balancing functionality . In other embodiments the load balancers comprise load balancing software installed on the management servers .

The primary storage and the backup storage can be implemented as any device or combination of devices capable of persistently storing data in non transitory computer readable storage media such as a hard disk drive RAM a writable compact disk CD or DVD a solid state memory device or other optical magnetic storage mediums. Other types of computer readable storage mediums can be used and it is expected that as new storage mediums are developed in the future they can be configured in accordance with the teachings here. In one embodiment the primary storage and the backup storage further comprise MySQL databases. The primary storage and backup storage can also comprise one or more dedicated storage servers. The primary storage for the management server cluster is communicatively coupled to the management servers and provides data storage as required by the management servers . The backup storage is communicatively coupled to the primary storage and comprises a replicated version of the data stored by the primary storage . The devices in the management server cluster may be Layer 2 switched.

In one embodiment the management server comprises a management user interface UI a management application programming interface API a service manager and a workload manager .

In one embodiment the management UI provides the primary user interface for customers and administrators . The management UI can provide a graphical user interface GUI that is accessible over the networks via a conventional web browser using any networked computing device. A customer can for example input specifications for configuring a new virtual machine using a web GUI provided by the management UI . More particularly a customer configures a virtual machine by specifying the amount of processor storage memory and networking resources in appropriate units e.g. processor speed for processors amount in mega or giga bytes for storage and memory and throughput for networking .

A customer can also interact with a configured virtual machine using a web GUI provided by the management UI by for example inputting data for processing by the virtual machine viewing outputs computed by the virtual machine and inputting commands related to a complete or partial shutdown of the virtual machine . The management UI can provide a different web GUI for a customer than for an administrator .

One embodiment of the management API allows an administrator or a customer with appropriate access credentials to further oversee virtual machine . For example the management API can enable customization of the primary user interface provided by the management UI . The management API can also allow customization of billing policies and procedures as well as access policies e.g. granting different levels of access to a virtual machine based on credentials associated with a customer .

The service manager communicates with computing servers to oversee the creation operation and shutdown of virtual machines . For example the service manager can receive specifications for a virtual machine from the management UI select a computing server suitable for hosting the virtual machine and transmit commands to the selected computing server that case the computing server to implement the virtual machine . Once the virtual machine is configured and implemented on the computing server the service manager can monitor its operation and implement corresponding billing and access policies e.g. via routing appliance discussed further in . For example the service manager can bill a customer 20 per hour of operation for a virtual machine with processing equivalent to a 1 GHz processor memory equivalent to 1 GB of RAM and storage equivalent to a 250 GB hard drive as well as 0.10 per GB of network traffic associated with the networking resource of the virtual machine .

The workload manager interacts with the multitenant hypervisors installed on the computing servers . The workload manager monitors the status e.g. availability and workload of the different physical computing elements included in the computing servers . The workload manager can also oversee the transfer of a virtual machine from a first computing server to a second computing server upon failure of the first computing server or an imbalance of workload between computing servers .

In a cloud infrastructure serving multiple customers the administrator may ensure that accesses are secure and protected against attacks from malicious customers by allocating resources on demand for instance. Routing appliances run as virtual machines in the system to provide functionalities such as routing DNS load balancing console access etc. When they are no longer needed they are garbage collected to release any precious system resources that they are holding. The routing appliances may be hosted by the routing server .

The eth0 interface of a routing appliance serves as the gateway for the guest virtual network and has the IP address of 10.1.1.1 which is configurable. The eth1 interface of the routing appliance resides on the management network and is used to configure the routing appliance. The eth2 interface is assigned a public IP address on the data network .

As indicated in VMs associated with customers and are segmented on the same physical network. In order for the VMs associated with a customer to access the internet or to accept connections from the internet such as ssh a routing appliance may be started up for the VM. In the example of customer accesses virtual machines VM and through routing appliance hosted on computing server while customer accesses virtual machines VM and through routing appliance . While physical resources such as network and physical server are shared the networks of customers are segmented and cannot see each other.

When a customer starts a VM in a certain zone a management server determines if a routing appliance for that customer is already running within that zone . If it is not the routing appliance is started prior to the actual start of the VM. As the VM starts the routing appliance may then provide network functionalities such as DHCP DNS routing load balancing and firewall protection to the VM. After the last VM associated with customer is stopped the management server garbage may garbage collect the routing appliances after a defined interval. One routing appliance may be needed per customer account per zone .

In one embodiment each customer is assigned a guest virtual network in each zone . A guest virtual network may be configured to any private address space for example the Class A network in 10.0.0.0 8 private address space. The guest virtual network is an overlay network on top of the management network and is managed by the multitenant hypervisor .

A guest virtual network may be valid within one zone . Therefore virtual machines in different zones cannot communicate with each other using their IP addresses in the guest virtual network. Virtual machines in different zones communicate with each other by routing through a public IP address.

A routing appliance is associated with each guest virtual network. The routing appliance automatically assigns an IP address for each virtual machine associated with the customer for example in the 10.0.0.0 8 network. The customer may manually reconfigure virtual machines to assume different IP addresses as long as the customer does not introduce IP address conflicts.

Source NAT is automatically configured in the routing appliance to forward out bound traffic for all virtual machines associated with the customer . The customer may configure port forwarding rules to direct inbound public traffic to the virtual machines associated with the customer . A management server programs the routing appliance and the firewall according to the port forwarding rules specified by the customer . A customer may also configure a software load balancer running on the routing appliance to dispatch inbound traffic to multiple virtual machines associated with the customer according to customer specified load balancing rules.

The cloud infrastructure can support multiple guest virtual networks per customer . The concept of routing appliances as virtual machines may be generalized to include virtual machines with multiple virtual NIC interfaces and connected to multiple guest virtual networks. The virtual NIC interfaces are discussed further in conjunction with .

As shown in although some of the physical resources are shared by the customers traffic between the two customers and their virtual machines is segmented using two separate routing appliances as are the individual virtual machines assigned to each customer .

The customer can provide a functional specification for the virtual machine i.e. that the virtual machine be capable of performing one or more specified computing tasks while meeting specified performance criteria or the customer can provide a resource specification for the virtual machine i.e. that the virtual machine include specified computing resources such as hardware and or software elements . The virtual machine can also be configured according to any number of default specifications. Once the virtual machine is configured the customer can access the virtual machine over the network and thereby interact with the virtual machine to accomplish tasks as desired. For example the customer can utilize remote access software such as secure shell and or virtual displays to control the virtual machine .

The agent running on the computing server on behalf of the management server ordering the instantiation sets up a number of virtual networking components that co operate to achieve communication between the virtualized operating system and the hardware. The virtual NIC is an emulated network adapter that shuttles traffic back and forth between dom0 and VM . The bridge is a virtual switch that shuttles traffic back and forth between two segments in this case the network adapter of the customer virtual machine and VLAN network adapter. The bridge may also comprise a VNIC in some embodiments. The VNIC is a pseudo network adapter that tags and untags frames in the communication using a standard for example the 802.1q trunking standard.

Similarly traffic from customer goes through routing device and when it meets the physical NIC of DOM 0 it goes instead through a separate bridge 2 for customer traffic before reaching virtual NIC1 or virtual NIC3 of virtual machines and respectively. Note that even though customer has two virtual machines within the computing server it has only one bridge 2 as only one is needed for each customer . Doing so allows traffic for the same customer to be seen but not traffic to from other customers e.g. on the same computing server

The cloud infrastructure combines physical host based network virtualization and physical network VLAN based network virtualization. Each customer s virtual machine gets the illusion of participating in a physically distinct local area network with the customer s other virtual machines. It is possible for example that both customer A s private network and customer B s private network is in the IP address space 10.1.1.0 24 but they never see each other s packets. It is possible that the networks addresses are not shared as well.

A prospective customer may contact the administrator requesting resources from the cloud infrastructure. The administrator registers a customer account in the name of customer . A management server reserves and assigns a unique VLAN ID Vx for example within the 802.1q VLAN range 12 bit number totaling 4000 possible unique IDs to the customer. If no unused VLAN IDs are found the customer is informed that it is not possible to start a virtual machine.

In some embodiments this ID is stored in a database that the management server uses. The customer now starts a virtual machine within the cloud infrastructure and the management server orders the instantiation of a virtual machine within one of the computing servers .

Vy is then transmitted to the agent running on the computing server in question as part of the virtual machine instantiation procedure. The agent uses Vy to set up a tagged VLAN interface that will shuffle the correct traffic back and forth between the network and the virtual machine. In some embodiments this setup communication happens through the management network . The management network shares the same physical network but is effectively segmented from other customers because it has a different or no tag. 

Traffic coming out of the virtual machines set up in this fashion will be tagged with the VLAN number as the packet travels through the multitenant hypervisor traffic coming into that interface tagged with Vy will be unwrapped from the tagged frame and delivered to the appropriate virtual machine based on the MAC address.

When a virtual machine associated with a customer actually starts on a particularly server the virtual NIC required to provide multi tenancy is created on the server and associated with the virtual machine to provide segmented network access. When the user VM is stopped the virtual NIC is destroyed i.e. garbage collected and its resources returned to the server .

In the embodiment of for VM and VM there s only one virtual NIC and bridge created because they belong to the same customer and the virtual machines are allowed to see each other s traffic. This makes the virtual NIC garbage collection more difficult as the agent cannot terminate the bridge until all virtual machines for that customer are stopped on that server . Each bridge and virtual NIC created requires resources on the server in terms of memory. The agent may create and garbage collect bridges and virtual NICs as needed.

In the embodiment of the zone level switch comprises two layer 3 switches L3 switches . Additionally redundant pairs of layer 2 switches L2 switches are deployed in the pod layer switches . In large deployments of pods that include multiple racks a second level of pod layer switch may be deployed.

Browser is an application running on customer device such as a web browser on a computer or mobile device capable of facilitating the communication of data images and or user input over network . Although only one customer is shown for clarity of description multiple customers may be included in the architecture as described elsewhere herein. Referring to the illustrated embodiments herein browser can be applications such as INTERNET EXPLORER OPERA SAFARI or FIREFOX or other applications supporting HTTP over TCP IP JAVA HTML and Asynchronous JavaScript and XML herein AJAX . In other embodiments specifically considering limited computing devices such as handhelds certain communications may be restricted on customer device or limited in order to facilitate proper operation. For example browser may still receive HTTP display update information even when communication of customer input is limited. Browser may communicate with management server DNS server and pod within zone over network according to various methods well known in the art which may include protocols such as TCP IP FTP HTTP DNS IMAP UDP or any other protocol capable of communicating data over a network.

DNS server is wild card capable and configured to translate viewing session connection requests into actual domain system names for console proxy virtual machines and servers . Browser uses the translated domain system names to connect to assigned console proxy servers. The translation method is described in further detail with .

Management server manages console proxy virtual machines in a similar method to that of any other virtual machine e.g. allocated to a pod . As described above management server creates terminates and migrates virtual machines as needed within and across pods . A number of dedicated console proxy virtual machines along with a number of virtual machines are running on computing server . While only console proxy virtual machines and virtual machines are discussed herein any type of virtual machine may reside on a computing server .

One or more console proxy servers reside within dedicated console proxy virtual machine . Each console proxy server may host a number of virtual machines for secure viewing sessions. Browser connects to one or more virtual machines associated with the customer through one or more console proxy servers . In one embodiment customers requesting access to a virtual machine are assigned a console proxy server to host their traffic. In other embodiments security protocols such as SSL or TLS provide secure HTTP HTTPS connections for multiple customers on one console proxy server instance . In one embodiment browser communicates with management server and DNS server to view virtual machine through console proxy server . In some embodiments all virtual machines assigned to console proxy virtual machine also are assigned a console proxy server residing on the console proxy virtual machine . Alternatively the console proxy virtual machine and console proxy servers are assigned only when browser accesses a virtual machine .

In the example presented herein DNS server operates the dynamic RealHostIP.com domain for illustrative purposes only. In response to assignment of a console proxy server management server requests browser to connect through RealHostIP DNS server . Connection request includes the corresponding name IP address of the allocated console proxy server . In others proxy server name IPs correspond directly to the actual IP addresses of console proxy servers and are decoded at RealHostIP DNS server . In the illustrated embodiment RealHostIP DNS server translates imbedded name IP addresses to actual console proxy server IP addresses. While a direct translation between the actual proxy IP address and name IP is presented herein one skilled in the art will recognize that methods of encoding and decoding such as hash tables and encryption keys are equally applicable. In one embodiment of the direct translation method console proxy server has assigned IP address 1.1.1.1 and the requested virtual machine instance not shown has local IP address 192.168.1.220 5903 management server requests that the browser connect through a URL say 1 1 1 1.RealHostIP.com to 192.168.1.220 5903. In response to browser request the RealHostIP DNS Server returns the corresponding actual proxy IP address 1.1.1.1 to browser . Responsive to receiving the proxy IP address browser initiates a TCP connection to the assigned console proxy server at IP address 1.1.1.1.

Following initiation of TCP connection browser and assigned proxy server participate in handshaking process . The handshaking process comprises the presentation of the RealHostIP.com digital certificate to browser verification of the certificate at browser and confirmation of connection to console proxy server target VM at local IP address 192.168.1.220 5903 to complete the handshake. A successful handshake results in a SSL or TLS connection facilitating HTTPS data exchange between browser and assigned console proxy server .

Responsive to completing handshake console proxy server connects to the requested virtual machine . In one embodiment management server provides console proxy server with virtual machine local IP addresses. Alternatively management server may indicate a customer virtual network or number of including a number of virtual machines available for viewing. In other instances console proxy server may already host connection to the requested virtual machine .

Referring to in response to starting a capacity scan management server determines whether another management server is running a scan. In embodiments with only one management server this logic is optional. Responsive to continuing the scan the management server calculates the theoretical maximum capacity of supported viewing sessions on running console proxy virtual machines . The management server also calculates the current assignment of viewing sessions in progress. The theoretical capacity and current assignment are determined from virtual machine information in database . Database includes virtual machine console proxy assignments and information on running console proxy virtual machines . In one embodiment an indication of sufficient reserve capacity is determined from the information calculated in and . Alternatively parameters such available viewing slots number of running servers or virtual machine instances theoretical capacity and current assignment are determined and operated on in a variety of methods. One skilled in the art will recognize database is capable of storing information capable of indicating reserve capacity or similar as determined in block .

If the determined reserve capacity is sufficient the management server may determine whether the reserve capacity is greater than needed. If the reserve capacity is greater than needed management server may destroy excess console proxy virtual machines . If the determined capacity is insufficient the management server may determine whether sufficient resources are available on a console proxy virtual machine . If sufficient resources are available on a console proxy virtual machine a new console proxy server instance is launched on virtual machine . Alternatively management server may launch a new console proxy virtual machine instance entirely and launch a console proxy server instance on new console proxy virtual machine before ending the current scanning period.

In one embodiment preparing the storage for a console proxy virtual machine instance comprises loading a console proxy virtual machine template onto the allocated storage server resource in a pod . However the storage server may be placed elsewhere according to other embodiments or types of storage used in the pod architecture as long as the coupling to the computing server provides the necessary data throughput. In one embodiment the console proxy template used to prepare storage in may be a dedicated virtual machine wherein the computing and disk configuration is optimally configured to avoid unnecessary overhead. In one embodiment the console proxy virtual machine template comprises a Fodera OS and automated configuration scripts for security and service auto starting.

Responsive to the return of a new console proxy assignment and corresponding virtual machine information browser connects to the assigned new console proxy server according to an embodiment described in and resumes the display. The connection to the newly assigned console proxy server may bypass a number of steps illustrated in to prevent the loss of session continuity. When a virtual machine is migrated the networking resources and specifically the associated network addresses are the same. Thus browser does not require re authentication with management server to access the migrated virtual machine . Depending on the embodiment if all console proxy servers reside on the RealHostIP.com domain browser need only resolve the console proxy server IP and TCP connect to it.

Console proxy servers communicate display updates from viewed virtual machines to browsers in the form of an image stripe according to one embodiment. Image stripes comprise changed portions of a virtual machine s display for communication to the browser . These changes may be communicated as a plurality of image tiles corresponding to changed areas as a single image or image stripe. Several embodiments concerning the creation of image stripes are discussed below.

A virtual machine s display image is mapped onto tiles corresponding to discrete locations within a browser window. show the image stripe process. illustrates tiles corresponding to discrete locations within browser window a virtual machine display image . Browser tiles may correspond to the virtual machine display completely such as tiles and or partially such as tiles and depending on tile geometry or size and tile location. When virtual machine display image only partially covers a tile or number of tiles partially covered tiles are padded to a full tile for display in the browser window . Alternatively the virtual machine display image or browser tiles may be positioned or sized in part to determine image quality or in response to browser window sizing. Additionally overall image quality may be handled by a console proxy server through compression or resize of the virtual machine display or image tiles containing display changes dirty tiles such as tiles through included in outbound image stripe updates. In four tiles tiles through are marked as dirty since they contain pixel information that has changed since the last browser update. These tiles will be included in an image stripe for the next browser update.

After an image strip is created from dirty tiles including a display change the dirty tiles are unmarked. Unmarking the dirty tiles indicates that another virtual machine display image image may be processed to determine a new set of dirty tiles and create a new image stripe.

VNC communication module within user virtual machine is configured to send display changes and or receive user input from devices such as a mouse keyboard touch screen or others well known in the art. Virtual Network Computing herein VNC is a graphical desktop sharing system using remote frame buffer herein RFB protocol to remotely control another computer. VNC and RFB are available under General Public License and easily extensible for custom applications. While VNC protocol is discussed herein in several embodiments any protocol layer or driver set capable of communicating display and or user input can provide an acceptable communication layer or protocol for data communication between console proxy server and user virtual machine .

HTTPS server is capable of combining the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the SSL TLS protocol to provide encrypted communication and secure identification of a network web server. Display translation module receives display updates from VNC communication module in native VNC protocol and translates them into an HTTPS based protocol. According to some embodiments display translation module creates image stripes from received display updates. User input translation module is configured to transmit input events to VNC communication module .

In use HTTPS server communicates outbound display updates to and receives inbound user input from browser . HTTP provides inherent firewall integration over networks e.g. as HTTP is typically allowed without specific network considerations for customer traffic. Outbound traffic results from a GET request GET commands request a representation of the specified resource. Multiple GET commands comprise the data sent as outbound traffic. For example browser may use a GET request to retrieve aggregated tile image and associated tile information from a specified location. Alternatively browser may use a GET request to retrieve the location of aggregated tile image and associated tile information and use a number of subsequent GET requests to retrieve the data. Inbound traffic results from a POST request or number of POST commands submit data to be process to the identified resource. For example browser may use a POST request or number of such requests to communicate input events. Alternatively any networking protocol or transport layer capable of data transfer between a client and server may be used.

In one embodiment HTTPS server is configured to send image stripes created in display translation module as outbound traffic and associated data in packets to browser in response to corresponding requests. HTTPS servers are well known in the art and capable of the functionality described herein.

In one embodiment browser may communicate user input to virtual machine through console proxy server . In the present embodiment for example browser aggregates input events and communicates a first in first out FIFO order for said events in an inbound packet. In one embodiment a HTTPS server capable of receiving POST requests receives inbound traffic containing aggregated user input packets from browser . In one embodiment user input translation module accesses the aggregated user input data received by HTTPS server and translates the input into appropriate VNC protocol.

In another embodiment HTTPS server sends user input POST packets or the location of received and stored user input POST packets to input translation module . In one embodiment input translation module transmits VNC input according to the FIFO order of the aggregated events communicated in the POST data to the VNC module on virtual machine thus preserving the original user input sequences as recorded and aggregated at browser .

Browser uses AJAX to facilitate asynchronous bi directional communication of HTTPS outbound and HTTPS inbound data. The asynchronous data exchange represents that the processes above and below the lines may occur simultaneously or in any order. The order of the illustrated elements is meant to convey the conceptual order of events and not necessarily the actual order. Accordingly AJAX enabled browser polls console proxy server for updated image stripes using HTTPS protocol while asynchronously transmitting other data such as user input. Input is aggregated at browser and transmitted asynchronously as a POST request packet to console proxy server . Alternatively input may be transmitted in response to a display update at browser or any other suitable method. Responsive to receiving post packet console proxy server translates the packet into user input for transmission to virtual machine .

AJAX facilitates the aggregation of input from devices such as a mouse keyboard touch screen or others well known in the art. For example if a number of mouse events occur within some temporal period they are collapsed into a single event. In one embodiment a plurality of events may undergo further aggregation and serialization before transmission. Input events are aggregated in a way to preserve FIFO as communicated by the input devices. Timestamps numbering methods and inherent data ordering are several ways well known in the art to appropriately communicate a FIFO order. In one embodiment following the creation of packets containing aggregated input events packet POST requests are also queued in FIFO order by browser to maintain FIFO event translation at a console proxy server .

AJAX facilitates asynchronous data transfer however other technologies can provide similar functionality. For example browser may be a standalone application and communicate with console proxy server using the illustrated HTTPS method a proprietary data exchange format or any other protocol capable of communicating image and user input events. Other embodiments may include a browser with limited functionality in such embodiments the browser may only participate in a portion of the processes discussed herein use a modified set of commands such as a mobile specific API and other communication methods well known in the art or use limited processing methods for the image stripes and user input as is typical with a number of mobile devices.

Tile rows are looped with the retrieved VNC image coordinates to determine whether a change occurs in the current tile row. In the present embodiment a change indicates any image update within a determined tile area. Changes include for example an update intersection with a tile boundary or an update wholly contained within a tile. After determining whether a change occurs in the current tile row the update is looped with the tile columns in the current row. Any changes within each tile column are determined for the current row. In the present embodiment tiles with changes are marked as dirty to indicate a display change occurred and updated in the image stripe being readied.

In one embodiment the entire update process of concludes before image stripe updates are made available to the HTTP server. Accordingly the update process loops through each column and row to determine all image changes contained in the VNC display update packet before ending . In other embodiments the HTTP server may accesses partially readied image stripe updates on browser request throughout the process.

While a row column incremental scan is implemented in one skilled in the art will recognize that other scanning and update methods applicable as well some of which are discussed herein. For example hysteresis logic can be implemented to determine which tiles are frequently dirty and in response scan those tiles more often than others. In other embodiments steps for abandoning the current update process when a new packet is received may be implemented. Accordingly the update process may continue from a previous location begin in a different sector or implement the hysteresis logic outlined above.

In accordance with embodiments discussed herein only tiles containing image changes are included in an image stripe update for HTTP communication to the browser. Thus the browser proxy server HTTP data exchange requires only the bandwidth needed to communicate display changes.
