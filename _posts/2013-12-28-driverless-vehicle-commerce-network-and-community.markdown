This disclosure relates generally to data processing devices and more particularly to a method and or a system of a driverless automobile commerce network and community is disclosed.

An proprietor may own and or lease a driverless vehicle e.g. a self driving vehicle an autonomous vehicle requiring no human driver . The driverless vehicle may remain unused for a portion of a day a week a month and or a year. For example the driverless vehicle may remain idle e.g. stationary unutilized when the proprietor is at home work and or on vacation.

Other individuals may wish to rent the driverless vehicle from the proprietor when the driverless vehicle is idle. The proprietor may be willing to share e.g. rent his her driverless vehicle to the other individuals when the driverless vehicle is idle. However the proprietor may not know who wants to borrow rent the driverless vehicle when it is predictably idle e.g. at a home location and or a work location at a predictable time of day . In addition the proprietor may not have a clear idea about how long a rental time of the driverless vehicle might be and or an expected time of return. In addition the proprietor may not trust the other individuals. Even still the other individuals may not be able to pay the proprietor when renting the driverless vehicle. Therefore valuable monetization opportunities of the driverless vehicle may be lost.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in in effect may create a link between verified users and or driverless vehicles of the network that allows the users and or driverless vehicles to communicate with each other and this link may be based on the physical distance between the users as measured relative to a current geospatial location of the driverless vehicle and or mobile device with a claimed and verified e.g. through a verification mechanism such as a postcard verification a utility bill verification and or a vouching of the user with other users non transitory location e.g. a home location a work location of the user and or other users. In an alternate embodiment the transitory location of the user e.g. their current location a current location of their vehicle and or mobile phone and or the driverless vehicle and or the other users may also be used by the radial algorithm to determine an appropriate threshold distance for broadcasting a message.

Furthermore the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may automatically update a set of pages associated with profiles of individuals and or businesses that have not yet joined the network based on preseeded address information. In effect the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may update preseeded pages in a geo constrained radial distance from where a broadcast originates e.g. using an epicenter calculated from the current location of the driverless vehicle and or a mobile device e.g. the mobile device of the owner of the driverless vehicle and or the recipient device with information about the automotive listing data . In effect through this methodology the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may leave inboxes and or post alerts on pages created for users that have not yet signed up based on a confirmed address of the users through a public and or a private data source e.g. from Infogroup from a white page directory etc. .

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in of the automobile sharing server may be different from previous implementations because it is the first implementation to simulate the experience of local radio transmission between individuals using the internet and non radio network technology by basing their network broadcast range on the proximity of verified users to one another according to one embodiment.

The radial algorithm may operate as follows according to one embodiment. The radial algorithm may utilize a radial distribution function e.g. a pair correlation function 

in the automobile sharing network . The radial distribution function may describe how density varies as a function of distance from a user according to one embodiment.

If a given user is taken to be at the origin O e.g. the epicenter and if is the average number density of recipients in the automobile sharing network then the local time averaged density at a distance r from O is according to one embodiment. This simplified definition may hold for a homogeneous and isotropic type of recipients according to one embodiment of the radial algorithm .

A more anisotropic distribution e.g. exhibiting properties with different values when measured in different directions of the recipients will be described below according to one embodiment of the radial algorithm . In simplest terms it may be a measure of the probability of finding a recipient at a distance of r away from a given user relative to that for an ideal distribution scenario according to one embodiment. The anisotropic algorithm involves determining how many recipients are within a distance of r and r dr away from the user according to one embodiment. The radial algorithm may be determined by calculating the distance between all user pairs and binning them into a user histogram according to one embodiment.

The histogram may then be normalized with respect to an ideal user at the origin o where user histograms are completely uncorrelated according to one embodiment. For three dimensions e.g. such as a building representation in the geospatially constrained social network in which there are multiple residents in each floor this normalization may be the number density of the system multiplied by the volume of the spherical shell which mathematically can be expressed as

The radial distribution function of the radial algorithm can be computed either via computer simulation methods like the Monte Carlo method or via the Ornstein Zernike equation using approximative closure relations like the Percus Yevick approximation or the Hypernetted Chain Theory according to one embodiment.

This may be important because by confining the broadcast reach of a verified user in the automobile sharing network to a specified range the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may replicate the experience of local radio broadcasting and enable verified users to communicate information to their immediate neighbors as well as receive information from their immediate neighbors in areas that they care about according to one embodiment. Such methodologies can be complemented with hyperlocal advertising targeted to potential users of the automobile sharing server on preseeded profile pages and or active user pages of the automobile sharing server . Advertisement communications thus may become highly specialized and localized resulting in an increase in their value and interest to the local verified users of the network through the automobile sharing server . For example advertisers may wish to communicate deals on driverless vehicles and or taxi services to frequent users.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may also have wide application as it may solve the problem of trying to locate a receptive audience to a verified user s broadcasts whether that broadcast may be a request to rent a one s personal music an advertisement for a vehicle for rent a solicitation for a new employee and or a recommendation for a good restaurant in the area. This radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may eliminate unnecessarily broadcasting that information to those who are not receptive to it both as a transmitter and as a recipient of the broadcast. The radial algorithm saves both time which may be limited in a situation in which a user requires transportation and effort of every user involved by transmitting information only to areas that a user cares about according to one embodiment.

In effect the radial algorithm of the automobile sharing server enables users to notify people around locations that are cared about e.g. around where they live work and or where they are physically located . In one embodiment the user can be provided feedback and or a communication that the recipient may be responding to the broadcast after the automotive listing data may be delivered to the recipients and or to the business establishments using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in of the automobile sharing server . For example after the automotive listing data may be delivered the driverless vehicle and or mobile device may display a message saying 3256 neighbors around a 1 radius from you have been notified on their profile pages of your automobile sharing broadcast in Menlo Park and 4 people are responding and or 8356 neighbors around a 2.7 radius from you have been notified of your live broadcast. 

In one embodiment users may be able to organize deliveries and or pick ups from a neighborhood drone e.g. an unmanned aerial vehicle such as the drone operated by the geospatially constrained social network . For example Fatdoor.com may operate a set of drones e.g. the drone of that can be dispatched and automatically instructed to pick up various items and deliver them to a resident of a home. The drone may be aircraft without a human pilot on board. A flight path of the drone may be a server of the geo spatially constrained social network either autonomously by computers in the drone and or through an automated navigation system based on a mapping algorithm.

In one embodiment a neighbor offering a used item may request that a drone operated by Fatdoor.com be summoned by clicking on request pickup on their mobile device. This may instruct the drone to fly to a backyard and or front yard the a home of a neighbor and physically pick up the used the item and deliver it to a borrower minimizing time to do neighborhood errands. A neighbor who is selling and or giving away an item may receive an alert when a drone arrives through their mobile device. Similarly the recipient of the item may receive an alert when the drone delivery is ready. Furthermore this way a limited set of drones can be shared by a set of users. Alternative to drones Fatdoor and or neighbors themselves may instruct driverless vehicles e.g. the driverless vehicle of that they operate to pick up and deliver items to each other through their mobile device using the geo spatial social network . The driverless vehicles may be personally owned and or owned by the geospatially constrained social network.

For example the driverless vehicle may be an autonomous vehicle e.g. a self driving vehicle robot vehicle that is an autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the transportation capabilities of a traditional vehicle. As an autonomous vehicle the driverless vehicle may be capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.

The driverless vehicle may be an autonomous vehicle that senses its surroundings with such techniques as radar lidar GPS and computer vision. Advanced control systems may interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths as well as obstacles and relevant signage to from a home offering a driverless automobile for rent in the geospatially constrained social network . The driverless vehicle may update its maps based on sensory input thereby permitting the driverless vehicle to keep track of their position even when conditions change or when they enter uncharted environments in the neighborhood.

The various embodiments described herein of the automobile sharing server using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may solve a central problem of internet radio service providers e.g. Pandora by retaining cultural significance related to a person s locations of association. For example the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be used to create new radio stations television stations and or mini alert broadcasts to a geospatially constrained area on one end and provide a means for those tuning in to consume information posted in a geospatial area that the listener vehicles about and or associates themselves with. The information provided can be actionable in that the user may be able to secure new opportunities through face to face human interaction and physical meeting not otherwise possible in internet radio scenarios.

The radial algorithm may be a set of instructions that may enable users e.g. verified users non verified users driverless vehicles of the Nextdoor.com and Fatdoor.com websites and applications to broadcast their activities e.g. rental availability Easter egg hunt garage sale t shirt sale crime alert to surrounding neighbors within a claimed neighborhood and to guests of a claimed neighborhood according to one embodiment. The radial algorithm may be new because current technology does not allow for users of a network e.g. Nextdoor.com Fatdoor.com to locally broadcast their activity to a locally defined geospatial area. With the radial algorithm users of the network may communicate with one another in a locally defined manner which may present more relevant information and activities according to one embodiment.

For example if a verified user of the network broadcasts an availability of a driverless vehicle locally defined neighbors of the verified user may be much more interested in responding than if they observed a vehicle for rent on a general news broadcast on traditional radio according to one embodiment. The radial distribution module may solve the problem of neighbors living in the locally defined geospatial area who don t typically interact and allows them to connect within a virtual space that did not exist before according to one embodiment. Prior to this embodiment of the radial algorithm operating through the radial distribution module community boards e.g. stolen or missing item boards may have been a method of distributing content in a surrounding neighborhood effectively. However there may have been little ways to easily distribute content related to exigent circumstances and or with urgency in a broadcast like manner to those listening around a neighborhood through mobile devices until the various embodiments applying the radial distribution module as described herein.

A radial algorithm may be a method of calculating a sequence of operations and in this case a sequence of radio operations according to one embodiment. Starting from an initial state and initial input the radial algorithm describes a computation that when executed proceeds through a finite number of well defined successive states eventually producing radial patterned distribution e.g. simulating a local radio station according to one embodiment.

The automobile sharing server may solve technical challenges through the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in by implementing a vigorous screening process to screen out any lewd or vulgar content in one embodiment. For example what may be considered lewd content sometimes could be subjective and verified users could argue that the operator of the automobile sharing server is restricting their constitutional right to freedom of speech e.g. if the automobile sharing server is operated by a government entity through a crowd moderation capability enabled by the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in according to one embodiment. In one embodiment verified users may sign an electronic agreement to screen their content and agree that the automobile sharing network may delete any content that it deems inappropriate for broadcasting through the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in according to one embodiment. For example it may be determined that a lost item such as a lost dog does not qualify as am automobile sharing related item that should be broadcast.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in in addition to broadcasts may allow verified users to create and broadcast their own radio show e.g. music talk show commercial instructional contents etc. and to choose their neighborhood s for broadcasting based on a claimed location according to one embodiment. The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may allow users to choose the neighborhoods that they would want to receive the broadcasts live and recorded broadcasts and or the types and topics e.g. vehicle rental of broadcasts that interest them.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in based approach of the automobile sharing server may be a completely different concept from the currently existing neighborhood e.g. geospatial social networking options. The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may also allow the user to create his her own radio station television station and or other content such as the automotive listing data and distribute this content around locations to users and preseeded profiles around them. For example the user may wish to broadcast their live reporting of an available driverless vehicle . The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in can allow verified users to create their content and broadcast in the selected geospatial area. It also allows verified listeners to listen to only the relevant local broadcasts of their choice.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be important because it may provide any verified user the opportunity to create his her own radial broadcast message e.g. can be audio video pictoral and or textual content and distribute this content to a broad group. Radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may also allow verified listeners to listen to any missed live broadcasts through the prerecorded features according to one embodiment.

Through this the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in changes the way social networks e.g. Nextdoor Fatdoor Facebook Path etc. operate by enabling location centric broadcasting to regions that a user vehicles about according to one embodiment. Radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may solve a technical challenge by defining ranges based on a type of an automobile listing broadcast a type of neighborhood and or boundary condition of a neighborhood by analyzing whether the automotive listing data may be associated with a particular kind of recipient a particular neighborhood a temporal limitation and or through another criteria.

By using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in of the automobile sharing server the user may be able to filter irrelevant offers and information provided by broadcasts. In one embodiment only the broadcasting user e.g. the driverless vehicle the owner of the driverless vehicle the renter e.g. the recipient may be a verified user to create accountability for a particular broadcast and or credibility of the broadcaster. In this embodiment recipients of the broadcast may not need to be verified users of the automobile sharing network. By directing traffic and organizing the onslaught of broadcasts the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in of the automobile sharing server may be able to identify the origins and nature of each group of incoming information and locate recipients that are relevant interested in the automotive listing data maximizing the effective use of each broadcast. For example the recipient may be able to specify that they do like SUVs so that they would be a relevant recipient for broadcast data regarding an SUV for rent. In another example a recipient may specify that they do not like SUVs and or do not want to rent from and or to a user with a certain rating so they would not be included in related broadcasts according to one embodiment.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in of the automobile sharing server may process the input data from the driverless vehicle and or mobile device e.g. the mobile device the recipient device in order to identify which notification s to broadcast to which individual s . This may be separate from a traditional radio broadcast as it not only geographically constrains broadcasters and recipients but also makes use of user preferences in order to allow broadcasters to target an optimal audience and allow recipients to alter and customize what they consume. The user may associate his herself with a non transitory address in order to remain constantly connected to their neighborhood and or neighbors even when they themselves or their neighbors are away. The radial algorithm may be also unique from a neighborhood social network e.g. the geospatially constrained social network as it permits users to broadcast emergencies information audio video etc. to other users allowing users to create their own stations.

In order to implement the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in geospatial data may need to be collected and amassed in order to create a foundation on which users may sign up and verify themselves by claiming a specific address associating themselves with that geospatial location. The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may then be able to utilize the geospatial database to filter out surrounding noise and deliver only relevant data to recipients .

In order to accomplish this the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be able to verify the reliability of geospatial coordinates time stamps and user information associated with the driverless vehicle and or mobile device. In addition threshold geospatial radii private neighborhood boundaries and personal preferences may be established in the automobile sharing server and accommodated using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in . The geospatial database may work in concert with the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in to store organize and manage broadcasts pushpins user profiles preseeded user profiles metadata and epicenter locations associated with the geospatially constrained social network e.g. a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com Nextdoor.com .

The radial algorithm may be used to calculate relative distances between each one of millions of records as associated with each placed geo spatial coordinate in the geospatially constrained social network e.g. a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com Nextdoor.com . Calculations of relative distance between each geospatial coordinate can be a large computational challenge because of the high number of reads writes modify and creates associated with each geospatial coordinate added to the geospatially constrained social network and subsequent recalculations of surrounding geospatial coordinates associated with other users and or other profile pages based a relative distance away from a newly added set of geospatial coordinates e.g. associated with the automotive listing data and or with other pushpin types . To overcome this computational challenge the radial algorithm may leverage a massively parallel computing architecture through which processing functions are distributed across a large set of processors accessed in a distributed computing system through the network .

In order to achieve the utilization of the massively parallel computing architecture in a context of a radial distribution function of a geospatially constrained social network a number of technical challenges have been overcome in at least one embodiment. Particularly the radial distribution module constructs a series of tables based on an ordered geospatial ranking based on frequency of interaction through a set of n number of users simultaneously interacting with the geospatially constrained social network in one preferred embodiment. In this manner sessions of access between the automobile sharing server and users of the automobile sharing server e.g. the user may be monitored based on geospatial claimed areas of the user e.g. a claimed work and or home location of the user and or the non transitory location of the driverless vehicle and or a present geospatial location of the user. In this manner tables associated with data related to claimed geospatial areas of the user e.g. the user the user s driverless vehicle and or the present geospatial location of the user may be anticipatorily cached in the memory to ensure that a response time of the geospatially constrained social network may be not constrained by delays caused by extraction retrieval and transformation of tables that are not likely to be required for a current and or anticipated set of sessions between users and the automobile sharing server .

In a preferred embodiment an elastic computing environment may be used by the radial distribution module to provide for increase decreases of capacity within minutes of a database function requirement. In this manner the radial distribution module can adapt to workload changes based on number of requests of processing simultaneous and or concurrent requests associated with automotive listing data by provisioning and deprovisioning resources in an autonomic manner such that at each point in time the available resources match the current demand as closely as possible.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be a concept whereby a server communicating data to a dispersed group of recipients over a network which may be an internet protocol based wide area network as opposed to a network communicating by radio frequency communications communicates that data only to a geospatially constrained group of recipients . The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may apply a geospatial constraint related to a radial distance away from an origin point or a constraint related to regional state territory county municipal neighborhood building community district locality and or other geospatial boundaries.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be new as applied to data traveling over wide area networks using internet protocol topology in a geospatial social networking and commerce context according to one embodiment. While radio broadcasts by their nature are transmitted in a radial pattern surrounding the origin point there may be no known mechanism for restricting access to the data only to verified users of a service subscribing to the broadcast. As applied to wired computer networks while techniques for applying geospatial constraints have been applied to search results and to other limited uses there has as yet been no application of geospatial constraint as applied to the various embodiments described herein using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in .

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be roughly analogous to broadcast radio communications such as a in broadcast radio b in wireless computer networking and c in mobile telephony. However all of these systems broadcast their information promiscuously making the data transmitted available to anyone within range of the transmitter who may be equipped with the appropriate receiving device. In contrast the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in herein describes a system in which networks are used to transmit data in a selective manner in that information may be distributed around a physical location of homes or businesses in areas of interest relevancy.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may solve a problem of restricting data transmitted over networks to specific users who are within a specified distance from the individual who originates the data. In a broad sense by enabling commerce and communications that are strictly limited within defined neighborhood boundaries the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may enable the geospatially constrained social network e.g. a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com Nextdoor.com communications attacking the serious social conditions of anonymity and disengagement in community that afflict the nation and increasingly the world.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may comprise one or more modules that instruct the automobile sharing server to restrict the broadcasting of the automotive listing data to one or more parts of the geospatial area . For example in the embodiment of the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may instruct the automobile sharing server to broadcast the automotive listing data to the recipients but not to the area outside the threshold radial distance .

In one or more embodiments the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may allow the automobile sharing server to function in manner that simulates a traditional radio broadcast e.g. using a radio tower to transmit a radio frequency signal in that both the automobile sharing server and the radio broadcast are restricted in the geospatial scope of the broadcast transmission. In one or more embodiments the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may prevent the broadcast of the automotive listing data to any geospatial area to which the user does not wish to transmit the automotive listing data and or to users that have either muted and or selectively subscribed to a set of broadcast feeds.

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may analyze the automotive listing data to determine which recipients may receive notification data within the threshold radial distance e.g. set by the user and or auto calculated based on a type of broadcast . The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may use a variety of parameters including information associated with the automotive listing data e.g. location of the driverless vehicle for rent type of vehicle rental price etc. to determine the threshold radial distance .

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may also determine which verified addresses associated with recipients having verified user profiles are located within the threshold radial distance . The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may then broadcast the notification data to the profiles and or mobile devices of the verified users having verified addresses within the threshold radial distance .

The radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may therefore simulate traditional radio broadcasting e.g. from a radio station transmission tower over the IP network. Thus the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may allow the broadcast to include information and data that traditional radio broadcasts may not be able to convey for example geospatial coordinates and or real time bi directional communications. Additionally the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may allow individual users low entry broadcast capability without resort to expensive equipment and or licensing by the Federal Communications Commission FCC .

Another advantage of this broadcast via the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be that it may bypass obstructions that traditionally disrupt radio waves such as mountains and or atmospheric disturbances. Yet another advantage of the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be that it may expand the physical distance of broadcast capability without resort to the expense ordinarily associated with generating powerful carrier signals. In yet another advantage the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may allow for almost unlimited channels and or stations as compared to traditional radio where only a narrow band of electromagnetic radiation has been appropriated for use among a small number of entities by government regulators e.g. the FCC .

The user may be an individual who owns the driverless vehicle and or operates the mobile device to generate the automotive listing data . It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the verified nature of the user may be an optional characteristic in an alternate embodiment. This means that in an alternate embodiment any user whether verified or not may generate the automotive listing data through the driverless vehicle and or mobile device e.g. the mobile device . In another alternative embodiment the user may be an electronic sensor such as a detection sensor device e.g. a traffic camera etc. and or an appliance e.g. a refrigerator a home security network and or a motion detector . It should also be noted that the mobile nature of the mobile device may be optional in yet another alternative embodiment. In such an alternate embodiment any computing device whether mobile portable or fixed in location may generate the automotive listing data .

The cellular network may be associated with a telephone carrier e.g. such as AT T Sprint etc. that provides an infrastructure through which communications are generated between the automobile sharing server and the business establishments using the radial algorithm . For example the cellular network may provide a communication infrastructure through which the automotive listing data may be communicated as voice and or text messages through telephones e.g. standard telephones and or smart phones operated by at least some of the business establishments of . It should be understood that in one embodiment the business establishments are paid subscribers customers of the geospatially constrained social network in a manner such that each of the business establishments may pay a fee per received automotive listing data and or each hired engagement to the geospatially constrained social network . The business establishments may pay extra to be permitted access to receive the automotive listing data even when they do not have a transitory and or non transitory connection to a neighborhood if they service that neighborhood area. For this reason visually illustrates that the business establishments may be located e.g. principal business address outside the threshold radial distance .

The cellular network e.g. a mobile network may be a wireless network distributed over land areas called cells each served by at least one fixed location transceiver known as a cell site or base station through which the automotive listing data is distributed from the automobile sharing server to telephones of the business establishments using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in according to one embodiment. The cellular network may use a set of frequencies from neighboring cells to avoid interference and provide guaranteed bandwidth within each cell in one embodiment.

When joined together these cells of the cellular network may provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area through the cellular network in a manner that ensures that the automotive listing data may be simultaneously communicated via both IP networks e.g. to the recipients and or to the business establishments through the cellular network . It will be appreciated that the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in in effect permits simultaneous updates to claimed user pages unclaimed preseeded user pages in a geospatially constrained social network e.g. neighborhood social network based on a geospatial location of the driverless vehicle and or mobile device in a manner that simulates a radio RF based network separately from the concepts described in conjunction with the cellular network . However it will be understood that the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in may be not restricted to such topology and can multimodally communicate through different networks such as through the cellular network described in .

The business establishments may be locations devices and or mobile phones associated with individuals and or agencies associated with businesses e.g. a car rental establishment a taxi limo service a delivery service an office building with employees that may require transportation . The business establishments may be notified when an automobile sharing broadcast in an area that they service including a non transitory location e.g. around where they live and or work regardless of where they currently are and a transitory location e.g. where they currently are is posted using the driverless vehicle and or mobile device e.g. the mobile device as the automotive listing data .

The business establishments are illustrated in as including a business A an automobile rental agency B and a taxi business C. In this manner mobile devices and or desktop computers operated by the business establishments may be alerted whenever the automotive listing data is posted in and or around their neighborhood through a push notification e.g. an alert popping up on their phone through an email a telephone call and or a voice message delivered to the particular mobile device operated by each of the business establishments using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in .

The automotive listing data may be delivered as notification data which may include a number of attributes from the automobile sharing server to the recipients and or to the business establishments using the radial distribution module e.g. that applies the radial algorithm of using a series of modules working in concert as described in of the automobile sharing server .

The recipients may be individuals that have claimed a profile e.g. verified their profile through a postcard a telephone lookup a utility bill associated with a particular non transitory address e.g. a home address a work address through a geospatial social network e.g. a geospatially constrained social network e.g. a neighborhood social network such as Fatdoor.com Nextdoor.com through which the automobile sharing server operates. The recipients may be in a geo fenced area in that an epicenter of a broadcast message from the driverless vehicle and or mobile device may be a center through which a radial distance is calculated based on a characteristic of the automotive listing data . For example a vehicle for rent by the user s work may be delivered only to an immediate 0.1 mile radius whereas vehicle for rent by the user s home may be automatically delivered to a broader 0.6 mile radius either automatically and or through a user defined preference e.g. set by the user .

It should be appreciated that individuals in an area outside the threshold radial distance may not receive the automotive listing data because their geospatial address may be outside a radial boundary surrounding an epicenter in which the automotive listing data originates. Additionally the threshold radial distance may be confined on its edges by a geospatial polygon at a juncture between the area defined by recipients and the area outside the threshold radial distance according to one embodiment.

Particularly illustrates an exploded view of the radial distribution module according to one embodiment. A variety of software instruction sets and or hardware components form the radial distribution module according to one embodiment. Select ones of these software instruction sets and or hardware components utilize the radial algorithm to perform functions related to radially distributing information to pre seeded user profiles user profiles and telephone devices e.g. land based phones circuit switched phones .

A validation module may determine that an automotive listing data generated through a mobile device may be associated with a verified user e.g. the user of as described as the verified user in of the automobile sharing server using a processor and or a memory . In addition the validation module may determine that the broadcast data e.g. the automotive listing data is generated by the validated user e.g. the user of as described as the verified user in of the neighborhood broadcast system e.g. of the geospatially constrained social network when analyzing that the broadcast data e.g. the automotive listing data is associated with the mobile device . The validation module may apply the radial algorithm to determine if the verified user may be in a validated geospatial location based on previous history of the verified user according to one embodiment.

In addition the validation module may ensure that a set of geospatial coordinates associated with the automotive listing data generated through the mobile device and or driverless vehicle are trusted based on a claimed geospatial location e.g. any of the claimed geospatial locations as described in of the verified user e.g. the user of as described as the verified user in of the automobile sharing server . The validation module may also determine that the automotive listing data is generated by the verified user of the neighborhood broadcast system when validating that the automotive listing data is associated with the mobile device

Particularly illustrates a broadcast view according to one embodiment. introduces a claimed neighborhood an owner of the driverless vehicle a set of preseeded user profiles a mobile device a drone and a claimed user profile and their relationships with elements previously described in . In addition explains the set of business establishments of to include business A an automobile rental agency B and a taxi business C a drone and a driverless vehicle .

In the claimed neighborhood may refer to a region that may be claimed by the user as being associated with a non transitory location e.g. a work address a home address of the user. The preseeded user profiles may refer to address information from people and or business directories that has been prepopulated in the geospatial social map and or may be associated with manually placed pushpins on the geospatial map in the geospatially constrained social network of . The claimed user profile may refer to the verified user associated with a verified address in the geospatial social map and or may be associated with claimed pushpin e.g. a previously preseeded residential and or business profile on the geospatial map in the geospatially constrained social network of . The owner of the driverless vehicle may be a verified user .

The business A an automobile rental agency B and a taxi business C may receive the automotive listing data through their mobile devices desktop devices and or through their cellular telephones. The business A an automobile rental agency B and a taxi business C may receive the automotive listing data and may bi directionally interact with the business establishments through either cellular network and or through the network e.g. an internet protocol network . When a query of the user interacting with any one of the recipients based on the bi directional communication is responded to the user may be able to choose which the business A an automobile rental agency B and a taxi business C.

The notification data may be communicated through the network to the preseeded user profiles within a threshold radial distance of the epicenter . Alternately the notification data may be communicated through the network to different ones of the claimed user profile within the claimed neighborhood that are located within the threshold radial distance from the epicenter . Additionally as described in it will be understood that the claimed neighborhood may be situated partially within the threshold radial distance and partially outside the threshold radial distance yet the notification data received by of the recipients e.g. having a claimed user profile may be propagated to other claimed user profiles within the claimed neighborhood even though they are outside the threshold radial distance .

The notification data may also be communicated through the cellular network or through the network to the set of business establishments . For example the business A may use the automobile sharing network to monitor queries e.g. for rentals in a neighborhood and publish sales to residents around a geospatial area of the neighborhood. In addition the business A an automobile rental agency B and a taxi business C may service a particular neighborhood and may be alerted of a new order and or query based on a subscription they pay to access broadcasts from areas that they service. Additionally it should be understood that other types of services and or businesses may receive the notification data . For example additional services receiving the notification data may include delivery services businesses with employees that may require transportation and or limo services.

In one embodiment deliveries e.g. of products from the business establishments neighbors other users may be made from a neighborhood drone e.g. an unmanned aerial vehicle such as the drone operated by the geospatially constrained social network . For example Fatdoor.com may operate a set of drones e.g. the drone of that can be dispatched and automatically instructed to pick up various items and deliver them to a resident of a home. The drone may be aircraft without a human pilot on board. A flight path of the drone may be a server of the geo spatially constrained social network either autonomously by computers in the drone and or through an automated navigation system based on a mapping algorithm.

In one embodiment a neighbor offering a used item e.g. a cup of sugar may request that a drone operated by Fatdoor.com be summoned by clicking on request pickup on their mobile device. This may instruct the drone to fly to a backyard and or front yard of a home of a neighbor and physically pick up the cup of sugar and deliver it to a neighbor minimizing time to do neighborhood errands. A neighbor who is selling and or giving away an item may receive an alert when a drone arrives through their mobile device. Similarly the recipient of the item may receive an alert when the drone delivery is ready.

Furthermore this way a limited set of drones can be shared by a set of users. The drones may be communicatively coupled with the automobile sharing server through the network the cellular network and or another network. Alternative to drones Fatdoor and or neighbors themselves may instruct driverless vehicles e.g. the driverless vehicle of that they operate to pick up and deliver items to each other through their mobile device using the geo spatial social network . The driverless vehicles may be personally owned and or owned by the geospatially constrained social network. The driverless vehicles may be communicatively coupled with the automobile sharing server through the network the cellular network and or another method.

For example the driverless vehicle may be an autonomous vehicle e.g. a self driving vehicle robot vehicle that is an autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the transportation capabilities of a traditional vehicle. As an autonomous vehicle the driverless vehicle may be capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.

The driverless vehicle may be an autonomous vehicle that senses its surroundings with such techniques as radar lidar GPS and computer vision. Advanced control systems may interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths as well as obstacles and relevant signage to from a home offering an item for sale in the geospatially constrained social network . The driverless vehicle may update its maps based on sensory input thereby permitting the driverless vehicle to keep track of their position even when conditions change or when they enter uncharted environments in the neighborhood.

The key describes that a checkmark inside a home in either the claimed neighborhood and or the unclaimed neighborhood indicates that the automotive listing data reaches a user associated with that address at a radial geospatial distance away. In contrast the key describes that an X mark inside a home in either the claimed neighborhood and or the unclaimed neighborhood indicates that the automotive listing data does not reach a user associated with that address at a radial geospatial distance away.

Particularly in an address associated with each user profile is illustrated according to one embodiment. In because the claimed neighborhood is partially within the threshold radial distance r every verified user in the claimed neighborhood receives the automotive listing data according to one embodiment. Thereby the radial broadcast distance r is extended to a as illustrated in e.g. the extended threshold radial distance of . It should be understood that in an alternate embodiment the radial broadcast of the automotive listing data may not extend to the entire group of users of the claimed neighborhood . However to promote neighborhood communication and cooperation the automotive listing data is illustrated as being extended to the claimed neighborhood in the embodiment of .

It should be also noted that in some embodiments the preseeded user profiles may be users that have previously signed up for the geospatially constrained social network as opposed to users that have been preseeded there in a social network. For example in one alternate embodiment each of the claimed neighborhood may serve as an approximate to actual radial distribution in that broadcast messages are solely sent to claimed neighborhoods e.g. private claimed neighborhoods of actual users in a vicinity of a broadcast rather than to public profiles .

Also illustrated in is the concept of the business establishment address within the threshold radial distance as shown in operation X the business establishment address outside the threshold radial distance but subscribing to extend threshold radial distance service as shown in operation e.g. a service that extends the threshold radial distance to R the extended threshold radial distance and the business establishment outside the threshold radial distance as illustrated in operation Y. Each of these different operations will be compared and contrasted. The business establishment address in operation X may receive the automotive listing data because the service provider in this example embodiment of is within the threshold radial distance according to one embodiment.

The business establishment address in operation may receive the automotive listing data because they provide a consideration e.g. pay a monthly subscription annual fee and or pay per access use fee to the geospatially constrained social network even though the business establishment in operation does not have a physical address within the threshold radial distance . In an alternate embodiment the business establishments need not pay a consideration for this service due to the beneficial societal nature of their participation in the geospatially constrained social network . The geospatially constrained social network e.g. or automobile sharing server may verify confirm and or ask for an assurance that the business establishment actually provides services in the threshold radial distance . The geospatially constrained social network and other the automobile sharing server may request feedback reviews and comments from homes businesses in the geospatially constrained social network for the business establishments in operation and operation X to ensure that they continue to be recommended and or are permitted to participate in the threshold radial distance around the epicenter e.g. where the broadcast originates in the geospatially constrained social network . Operation Y indicates that a service provider e.g. business establishment outside the threshold radial distance does not receive the automotive listing data and therefore cannot participate bi directionally in the geospatially constrained social network .

Particularly illustrates an operation of an association with verified address which illustrates the recipient device can be associated to a remote address and a time stamp associated with a creation time a creation date and a set of geospatial coordinates generated from a driverless vehicle and or mobile device . The remote address may be a non transitory location such as a home and or a work address of the recipient e.g. the user generating the automotive listing data according to one embodiment. The non transitory location may be a place of domicile e.g. a home and or a place of work e.g. a physical location and or a principle place of business of a property e.g. a work address and or business associated with the user according to one embodiment.

The concept illustrates that the recipient device may be located at a physical location outside the threshold radial distance and still get the automotive listing data and or the notification data if the recipient device e.g. a mobile phone has verified an address at a location that they care about and or are associated with e.g. a location in which they live work and or have guest access that is within the threshold radial distance . In other words the user may receive broadcast e.g. the notification data and or the automotive listing data which may be live streamed and or through after the event notifications related to a radial distance from their home and or work even when physically at a location outside their claimed non transitory location.

The user e.g. the owner of the driverless vehicle may be able to set the listing criteria for renting their driverless vehicle. The listing criteria may include a rental type a number of people a specification of payment e.g. by mile by hour an operating radius and or a participation criteria. The participation criteria may enable the user e.g. the renter the owner of the driverless vehicle to allow communication between users e.g. all renters all verified users all recipients of the broadcast . The user e.g. the owner of the driverless vehicle may be able to enter details about their vehicle and or rules e.g. no pets in the vehicle in the description entry field . The date time indicator may enable the user of the mobile device to indicate the date and or times that their vehicle is available to be rented. In one embodiment the date time indicator and or the description entry field may be included in the listing criteria . The broadcast indicator may allow the user to broadcast the information they have entered to other users e.g. all verified users in a threshold radial distance from the driverless vehicle and or the owner of the driverless vehicle s current location .

The vehicle location may be the current location of the driverless vehicle and or the non transitory location of the driverless vehicle . The recipient location may indicate the geospatial location of an individual who received the broadcast. The driverless vehicle listing map may be a geospatial map of the user s e.g. the owner of the driverless vehicle current location and or claimed geospatial locations e.g. claimed neighborhoods on which the vehicle location and or the recipient location is shown.

A user e.g. a verified user may be able to enter rental details through their mobile device e.g. the recipient device including a desired make and or model of vehicle a number of passengers a duration of the rental a desired start and or end time of the rental a payment method e.g. credit card by mile by hour a color of the vehicle. The renter e.g. user of the recipient device may be able to view their location on the driverless vehicle locator map as the user location . Available vehicles and or all registered vehicles within a certain proximity to the user and or the user s claimed geospatial locations may be visible on the driverless vehicle locator and or may display automobile sharing alert pushpins . The user e.g. the renter may be able to view the movement of vehicles on the map. The rental indicator may allow the user to see the time of pick up e.g. when the vehicle they requested and or are viewing could be at their location . In one embodiment only driverless vehicles with listing criteria that match the rental details may be presented on the driverless vehicle locator map .

The recipient may be able to view the live broadcast e.g. as an on page posting push notification update on the recipient device . The user e.g. the recipient the renter may be able to view their location as a recipient location on the driverless vehicle listing map . The user may also be able to view the source location of the broadcast e.g. the vehicle location the location of the user making the broadcast the non transitory location of the driverless vehicle . The recipient may be able to view the location associated with the broadcast e.g. the non transitory location of the driverless vehicle as an address set of geospatial coordinates etc.

The recipient of the live broadcast may be able to view a rating of the user making the broadcast and or the driverless vehicle associated with the broadcast. The ratings may be a single rating and or a collection of any number of ratings of the user making the broadcast and or the driverless vehicle associated with the broadcast. The review may be a single review and or a collection of any number of reviews of the user making the broadcast and or the driverless vehicle associated with the broadcast. The rental details may be details regarding the make model and or color of the driverless vehicle and or listing criteria and or additional information.

In one embodiment the live broadcast may be made about a user and or driverless vehicle from a renter and broadcasted to other recipients and the ratings and or review and or rental description may be that of the renter making the broadcast. The bi directional communication indicator may enable the recipient to communicate with other recipients of the live broadcast and or the user making the broadcast. The update may be automatically deleted at a specified automobile sharing alert expiration time .

In the example embodiment of the user e.g. the verified user that made the broadcast e.g. the owner of the driverless vehicle may be able to view a summary data of the number of profiles that were updated with the user s broadcast. The user may be presented with a summary of recipients notified and may be able to select profile links to view the profiles of the recipients that received the broadcast. The user may be able to view a summary of recipients responding to the broadcast. In one embodiment the user may be able to view the responses from the recipients .

In the embodiment of the user is presented with a collection of the summary data . The summary data may display on the mobile device how many recipients received the live broadcast . The summary data may also show by the summary of recipients notified how many user profile pages were updated with an alert of the automotive listing data generated through the mobile device and or driverless vehicle when publishing the automotive listing data generated through the mobile device and or driverless vehicle in the private neighborhood community and or the set of user profiles e.g. preseeded user profiles and or claimed user profiles as described in having associated verified addresses in the threshold radial distance from the claimed geospatial location e.g. any of the claimed geospatial locations as described in of the verified user e.g. the user of as described as the verified user in of the automobile sharing server based on the set of preferences of the verified user e.g. the user of FIG. as described as the verified user in . Additionally the user may also be able to see the summary of recipients responding to the broadcast.

In the broadcast pushpin e.g. that may generate the automotive listing data may be unique in that it can only be placed through a device that has a geo spatial chip and which can verify a geo spatial location of a device making the broadcast. In this way the broadcast pushpin is fixed in time and place whereas the other pushpins can be manually dragged to the map through the drag drop function .

Particularly further illustrates a request to rent broadcast data and a request to rent notification data . After the user s broadcast reaches recipients with verified addresses within a threshold radial distance from the epicenter illustrated in the recipients may broadcast responses illustrated in as request to rent broadcast data along path circle 1 through the network and or the cellular network not shown . The request to rent broadcast data may be generated by the recipient device and sent via the network to the automobile sharing server . Second the request to rent notification data may be automatically generated using the request to rent broadcast data by the automobile sharing server .

The request to rent notification data may then be broadcasted to the driverless vehicle not shown and or owner of the driverless vehicle and or recipients along path circle 2 using the radial distribution module . The request to rent notification data may move along path circle 2 through the network to the driverless vehicle associated with the user and or other recipients that may have received the original broadcast from the user. In one embodiment the communication illustrated in may happen between the recipients and the driverless vehicle . Upon receiving the request to rent notification data the owner of the driverless vehicle may respond in the form of a dismiss a save a rating a review and or a rental acceptance of a renter e.g. recipient associated with the automotive listing data . The automobile sharing server may analyze the response of the owner of the driverless vehicle .

In the 19th Century trains may have been the dominant way of traveling long distances and wagons and horses may have been good for short trips. In the 20th Century automobiles and trucks may have become the most dominant mode of transportation. So when the Depression hit people with little money may have been forced to find new ways of getting around. Hitching a ride in a car or truck may have gained in popularity around this time. Riding the rails may have been an established practice but it may have been dangerous and illegal. Hitchhiking may have been legal and slightly safer even if it was more uncertain. In later years hitching may have developed into an entire subculture. Actually hitchhiking may have been known from the earliest days of the automobile. The various technologies described herein may make hitchhiking safer more trusted and legal.

Hitchhiking also known as thumbing or hitching may be a means of transportation that is gained by asking people e.g. strangers for a ride in their automobile or other road vehicle e.g. a ride request shown in . The latter may require many rides from different people. A ride may be but may not always be free. If the hitchhiker e.g. the requester of wishes to indicate that they need a ride they may simply make a physical gesture or display a written sign. Hitchhiking may be part of the American psyche and many people may continue to stick out their thumbs. Hitchhiking may be one of the cheapest ways of traveling. By tradition hitchhiking may be defined as soliciting a ride by standing at the edge of a road facing traffic with one s thumb extended upwards. A hitchhiker may be able to meet a lot of people and make lots of friends. They may also become very frustrated and or encounter danger on the way. However people who do pick up hitchhikers tend to be very friendly. Still hitchhikers also risk being picked up by someone who is an unsafe driver or even personally dangerous as there may be no effective way to vet potential drivers and or hold the driver accountable for their actions. The various embodiments described herein overcome some of the challenges of the past faced with hitchhiking by creating a trusted community and sharing platform of driverless cars.

Contrary to many preconceived notions hitchhiking can be a safe positive experience allowing travelers to connect with locals and form unexpected friendships through the various embodiments described in .

The requester may be able to view automobile sharing alert pushpins above the locations of the drivers e.g. driver location . The user may be able to select the automobile sharing alert pushpins and view a short profile of the driver a full profile of the driver a rating of the driver e.g. an overall rating a collection of ratings a past rating by the requester a review of the driver e.g. an overall review a collection of reviews a past review by the requester an estimated time of pick up rules of the driver e.g. car rules etc. The requester may be able to communicate with a driver by selecting the automobile sharing alert pushpin or by other means. The ride time indicator may show a ride time e.g. an estimated time of arrival at the destination from pick up and or an estimated time of arrival at the destination from that very moment .

The requester e.g. the verified user may be able to enter details of their ride request in the ride details . The requester may be able to enter a type of vehicle desired a category of drivers e.g. verified users vehicles user profiles to show as options e.g. in a list on the ride locator map . For example the requester may wish to only view ride options within a certain distance from their location drivers that the requester has ridden with before drivers on a favorites list of the requester specific drivers drivers with certain ratings drivers with certain rules for the car etc. The requester may be able to enter a number of passengers a destination a desired pick up and or arrival time a duration of the ride e.g. the number of miles and or time a payment method e.g. a credit card associated with the account of the requester and or an offer for the ride.

The driver may also be able to view the time to requester location . This may enable the driver to assess if they will be able to pick the requester up by the desired pick up time specified by the requester. In one embodiment only certain drivers e.g. drivers within a certain distance from the requester and or drivers the automobile sharing server assesses to be able to pick the requester up by the specified pick up time will receive the ride request . The driver may be able to view the ride details which may include the distance and or duration of the ride the desired pick up time the offer the destination the desired arrival time and or additional comments from the requester.

In one embodiment the driver may be able to participate in bidding for the ride request with other drivers in a threshold distance from the requester location .

It should be noted that there are a number of different user roles described in the various embodiments described herein. The user roles include a user a claimed user and a verified user . The user is someone that has signed up for and or accessed the automobile sharing server through the geospatially constrained social network . The user can claim an existing profile e.g. prepopulated and or created by another user through a wiki like creation process and or claim an address with a new location thereby transforming the user to the claimed user . The claimed user can verify that they actually live at a particular home address and or work at a particular business address e.g. thereby showing their affiliation with a non transitory location by submitting a response to a verification code on a postcard submitting a utility bill and or being invited by and or getting vouched for by an existing verified user. This can transform the claimed user to a verified user in one embodiment. It will be understood by those with skill in the art that the user may refer to either a user that has not yet claimed the claimed user and or the verified user.

In various embodiments the automobile sharing network may be a decentralized peer to peer system in which there is no central organization that controls the distribution maintenance adoption of standards car rules payment rules adoption and or standards for drivers etc. In one embodiment government regulations may not apply to the users e.g. drivers and or requesters of the automobile sharing server because each peer may choose how to operate his or her vehicle e.g. how to conduct payment when how and or where they offer rides . The automobile sharing server may serve as a third party enabler of interactions between parties to enable these private parties to engage in private transactions without a central intermediary. Thus parties may be able to freely interact and or set their own standards for interactions without the control and or dictation of a central organization.

In one embodiment the users e.g. drivers of the automobile sharing network may pay a percentage of what they earn and or a flat rate e.g. a membership a monthly yearly daily flat rate by trip fee etc. for using the network. In one embodiment the users of the automobile sharing network may be able to set their own payment standards e.g. by bidding for rides by setting a flat rate by destination by paying by mile by time by amount of energy e.g. gas used . Once a payment standard is set by the driver and or the user e.g. requester the deal may be locked by the automobile sharing server and or payment may be conducted through the application on the mobile device s e.g. through a verified credit card associated with the requester s profile on the automobile sharing network .

A Multi Family Residence page will display a list of residents in the entire building according to one embodiment. Clicking on any resident will display a Single Family Residence page corresponding to the individual living unit where that person resides according to one embodiment.

For example suppose that John Smith and Jane Smith live in apartment of a large building. Their names are included in the list of residents. When a user clicks on either John Smith or Jane Smith we will display a Single Family Residence page showing both John and Jane just as if apartment was a separate structure according to one embodiment.

The broadcast feature e.g. associated with the automotive listing data and generated by the radial algorithm of the radial distribution module may be a Radio like function that uses the mobile device s current geospatial location to send out information to neighbors around the present geospatial location of the user according to one embodiment. Broadcasts may be posted to neighbor pages in the geospatial vicinity e.g. in the same neighborhood on public and private pages in the geospatial social network according to one embodiment. These broadcasts may enable any user whether they live in a neighborhood or not to communicate their thoughts to those that live or work or have claimed a profile in the neighborhood around where the broadcaster is physically at regardless of where the broadcaster lives according to one embodiment. Broadcasts can be audio video pictures and or text according to one embodiment. For accountability the broadcaster may be a verified user and their identity made public to all users who receive the broadcast in one embodiment.

This means that the broadcast feature may be restricted to be used only by devices e.g. mobile phones that have a GPS chip or other geolocation device that an identify a present location of where the broadcast is originating from according to one embodiment. The broadcast may be sent to all users who have claimed a profile in the geo spatial vicinity where the broadcast originates according to one embodiment. This can either be broadcast live to whoever is tuned in to a broadcast of video audio picture and text in their neighborhood or can be posted on each users profile if they do not hear the broadcast to the neighborhood in a live mode in one embodiment.

When a broadcast is made neighbors around where the broadcast is made they may receive a message that says something like 

Raj Abhyanker a user in Menlo Park just broadcast Japanese cultural program video from the Cupertino Union church just now. Watch Listen View

This broadcast may be shared with neighbors around Menlo Park and or in Cupertino. This way Raj s neighbors and those in Cupertino can know what is happening in their neighborhoods according to one embodiment. In one embodiment the broadcast only goes to one area Cupertino or Menlo Park in the example above .

Broadcasts could be constrained to devices that have geospatial accuracy of present location and a current only mobile devices for example . Otherwise broadcasts won t mean much according to one embodiment would otherwise be just like thoughts video upload without this . Broadcasts shouldn t be confused with upload videos according to one embodiment. Different concepts. Why Broadcasts have an accuracy of time and location that cannot be altered by a user according to one embodiment. Hence mobile is the most likely medium for this not desktop computer according to one embodiment. We should not let the user set their own location for broadcasts like other pushpin types according to one embodiment. Also time is fixed according to one embodiment. Fixing and not making these two variables editable give users confidence that the broadcast was associated with a particular time and place and creates a very unique feature according to one embodiment. For example it would be not useful if the broadcast is untrusted as to location of origination according to one embodiment. E.g. I broadcast when I am somewhere only about the location I am at according to one embodiment.

Broadcasts are different that other pushpins because location of where a broadcast and time of broadcast is

 current location and current time according to one embodiment. They are initiated wherever a broadcaster is presently at and added to the news feed in the broadcasters neighborhood and in the area wherever a broadcaster is presently at according to one embodiment.

1. If I post a Broadcast in my secured neighborhood only my neighbors can see it according to one embodiment.

2. If I post a Broadcast in different secured neighborhood then my own my neighbors can see it e.g. unless I turn this off in my privacy setting and neighbors in the secured neighborhood can see it e.g. default not turn offable but I can delete my broadcast according to one embodiment.

3. If I post a Broadcast in different unsecured neighborhood then my own my neighbors can see it unless I turn this off in my privacy setting and the broadcast is publicly visible on user pages of public user profiles in the unsecured neighborhood until profiles are claimed and or the neighborhood is secured according to one embodiment.

4. If an outsider in a secure neighborhood posts a broadcast in my secure neighborhood it s not public according to one embodiment.

5. If an outsider in a unsecure neighborhood posts a broadcast in my secure neighborhood the system does not post on profiles in his unsecure neighborhood to prevent stalking burglary but does post in my secure neighborhood according to one embodiment.

Privacy settings. For each verified residential or business location the user may set Privacy to Default Public Private or Inactive according to one embodiment. The Default setting which is the default means that the profile will be public until the neighborhood is secured in a secured neighborhood the profile will be Private according to one embodiment. By changing this setting the user may force the profile to be Public or Private regardless of whether the neighborhood is secured according to one embodiment.

For each verified residential location the user may set edit access to Group Editable or Self Editable according to one embodiment.

Residential Privacy example. The residential profiles can be Public anyone can search browse or view the user profile according to one embodiment. This is the default setting for unsecured neighborhoods initially all the content on the site according to one embodiment. Private only people in my neighborhood can search browse or view the user s profile according to one embodiment. This is the default for secured neighborhoods according to one embodiment. Inactive nobody can search browse or view the profile even within a secured neighborhood according to one embodiment. A user may have at least one active public or private verified profile in order to have edit capabilities according to one embodiment if the user makes all profiles inactive that user is treated for edit purposes as an unverified user according to one embodiment.

Verified users can edit the privacy setting for their profile and override the default according to one embodiment. Group Editable anyone with access to a profile based on the privacy roles above can edit the profile according to one embodiment. This is the default setting according to one embodiment Self Editable only the verified owner of a profile can edit that profile according to one embodiment.

Exceptions Guest User. A verified user in another neighborhood is given Guest access to a neighborhood for a maximum of 60 days by a verified user in the neighborhood in which the guest access is given according to one embodiment. In effect the guest becomes a member of the neighborhood for a limited period according to one embodiment. Friend. When a user has self elected being friends with someone in a different neighborhood they can view each other s profiles only not their neighbors according to one embodiment. One way for a user to verify a location is to submit a scanned utility bill according to one embodiment.

When a moderator selects the Verify Utility Bills function the screen will display a list of items for processing according to one embodiment. Accept the utility bill as a means of verification according to one embodiment. This will verify the user s location and will also generate an e mail to the user according to one embodiment. Or Decline the utility bill as a means of verification according to one embodiment. There will be a drop down list to allow the moderator to select a reason according to one embodiment this reason will be included in an e mail message to the user. Reasons may include Name does not match address does not match name address can t be read not a valid utility bill according to one embodiment.

Additionally for example the broadcast may even occur automatically and simultaneously when a user lists and or rents a driverless vehicle. Upon listing viewing and or renting a driverless vehicle through the user interfaces of recipients within a threshold radial distance e.g. selected by the user from the claimed geospatial location and or current location of the user may be updated and or may be able to contact the user indicating that they have a similar driverless vehicle for rent and or require a driverless vehicle like the one listed. This may allow users to share driverless vehicles and or find optimal rental arrangements quickly and or conveniently.

The driverless vehicle described in the various embodiments may have anti lock brakes that may need the driver to step on the brake pedal in order to work but they may perform a function that drivers used to have to do themselves. When the driverless vehicle is braking hard and does not have anti lock brakes the wheels may lock up which may send the vehicle into an out of control skid.

The driverless vehicle may use sensors to provide traction and stability control. They may use the sensors at the wheels to detect when a vehicle might go into an out of control skid and or roll over and or then they may use ABS and engine management to keep the vehicle on the road and right side up. Unlike a driver these systems may apply the brakes and increase or decrease power to individual wheels which may be often better than brakes or power being applied to all four wheels by a human foot mashing the brake pedal in a blind panic. Already the driverless vehicle may be a better driver than the driver with these technologies. The systems may differ depending on the driverless vehicle but what the driverless vehicle may have in common may be that they can anticipate crashes and or prepare the vehicle to keep the occupants safe.

For example the driverless vehicle may come around a corner only to find a garbage truck stopped in its lane. In the driverless vehicle with a pre safe system an alarm might go off as the vehicle nears the truck. The driverless vehicle may reduce engine power which may slow the driverless vehicle and reduce the severity of the crash if there is one to come. Finally if the system detects that a crash cannot be avoided the system e.g. the on board computer system of may prepare the airbags for deployment and tighten all of the seat belts. The system of the driverless vehicle may do all that in less time than it takes the driver to simply slam on the brakes.

Several manufacturers may offer automatic parking systems on everything from SUVs to compact versions of the driverless vehicle and hybrids as shown and described in . The systems may use sensors all around the driverless vehicle to guide it into a parallel parking space with no human input required. Before it can work the driverless vehicle may have to find a parking space position the vehicle next to it and or use the navigation screen to tell the driverless vehicle where it should go. Still the self parking system may be a big achievement in driverless vehicle technology. With it the driverless vehicle may behave like a driver might reading the area around it reacting accordingly and or going safely from point A to point B as shown and described in .

Semi driverless and or driverless systems may not have hands as shown and described in . It should be noted that the driverless vehicle may be a semi driverless vehicle in some embodiments. As the technology progresses the legal issues may follow.

Semi autonomous systems of the driverless vehicle may do more than just see the road. Using an array of sensors lasers radar cameras and GPS technology they may be able to actually analyze a vehicle s surroundings. Semi autonomous systems may be a combination of two technologies. The first may be adaptive cruise control of the driverless vehicle which may use a long range radar e.g. more than 100 meters in the grille to keep the vehicle a uniform distance behind another vehicle while maintaining a set speed as shown and described in . The second lane centering may use multiple cameras with machine vision software to read road lines and detect objects near the driverless vehicle .

This information may then be sent to a computer e.g. a geospatially constrained network of a car manufacturer that processes the data and adjusts the electrically assisted steering to keep the vehicle centered in the lane as shown and described in . Because semiautonomous systems may be intended only for highways manufacturers may use the driverless vehicle sGPS to determine its location before allowing the driver to engage the feature. In addition manufacturers may also considering using short range radars e.g. 30 to 50 meters and or extra ultrasonic sensors e.g. 3 meters to enhance the driverless vehicle soverall awareness as shown in . The driverless vehicle with park assist systems may already have four similar sensors in the front and in the rear of the vehicle. Manufacturers may also be experimenting with cost effective LIDAR units which may use lasers instead of sound and may be more powerful and accurate than ultrasonic sensors as shown in . It is unclear whether LIDAR will make it into the same driverless vehicle as some semiautonomous systems.

The heart of these semiautonomous systems may be a laser range finder mounted on the roof of the driverless vehicle . The device e.g. a Velodyne 64 beam laser may generate a detailed 3D map of the environment as shown in . The driverless vehicle then may combine the laser measurements with high resolution maps of the world which may allow the device to produce different types of data models that may allow it to drive itself while avoiding obstacles and respecting traffic laws. The driverless vehicle shown in may also be associated with other sensors which may include four radars mounted on the front and or rear bumpers that may allow the vehicle to see far enough to be able to deal with fast traffic on freeways a camera which may be positioned near the rear view mirror that detects traffic lights and or a GPS inertial measurement unit and or wheel encoder that may determine the vehicle s location and or keep track of its movements as shown in . The driverless vehicle may rely on very detailed maps of the roads and or terrain something that may be essential to determine accurately where the driverless vehicle is as shown in . Using GPS based techniques alone the location may be off by several meters.

Before sending the driverless vehicle on a road test e.g. without a driver the driverless vehicle may need to drive along the route one or more times to gather data about the environment. When it is the driverless vehicle s turn to drive itself it may compare the data it acquires to the previously recorded data an approach that may be useful to differentiate pedestrians from stationary objects like poles and or mailboxes . Sometimes however the driverless vehicle e.g. the driverless vehicle of may need to be more aggressive. When going through a four way intersection for example it may yield to other vehicles based on road rules but if other vehicles don t reciprocate it may advance a bit to show to the other drivers and or driverless vehicles its intention as shown in . Without programming that kind of behavior it may be impossible for the driverless vehicle to drive in the real world.

Driverless vehicles could help make transportation safer and or more efficient Driverless vehicles may be able to drive closer to each other shown in making better use of the 80 percent to 90 percent of empty space on roads and or also form speedy convoys on freeways. Driverless vehicles may react faster than humans to avoid accidents potentially saving thousands of lives as shown in . Making vehicles smarter may require lots of computing power and data.

Cruise Control Cruise control systems of the driverless vehicle may work in order to keep a vehicle in constant speed without the driver having to apply gas.

Anti Lock Brakes This may be a system that automatically prevents the locking of brakes when the driverless vehicle applies the brakes in full. The system may perform a better job than the driver as far as pumping the brakes in order to prevent the vehicle to spin and fall out of control.

Stability and Traction Control These may be the systems that use different sensors in order to determine when the driverless vehicle might skid or roll over and work in order to prevent it and may be much more complicated in comparison to the above mentioned systems. The driverless vehicle direction speed the contact pressure between the road and or the wheels may be constantly monitored and or when it is determined that the vehicle is going out of control the system may take over and apply brakes and or adjust the pressure on each wheel which may almost always be better and or more optimized than a human driver might be able to do as shown in . The system may use digital encoders similar to the ones used in anti lock braking systems in order to precisely measure wheel rotation.

Pre Accident Systems These may be the systems that sense an imminent crash and or prepare the driverless vehicle just before it in order to save lives and reduce injuries as shown in . The system may prepare airbags reduce engine power and or tighten the seat belts in a very short time even before the driver has the time to apply the brakes in full.

Traffic Jam Assist Another step to full autonomy may be the traffic jam assist system which may relieve drivers from the tiring work of stop and go traffic as shown in .

Improved Cruise Control In addition to the regular cruise control using radar sensors placed in front of the driverless vehicle the system may be able to sense the vehicle in front and or may adjust the speed accordingly in order to maintain a safe distance between two vehicles as shown in .

Fully driverless vehicles The driverless vehicle may be able to completely manage itself from point A to point B without any human intervention whatsoever as shown in . The driverless vehicle may need to do basically two things to find their way and drive First the driverless vehicle may require the complete map of its surrounding area including the objects and the travel path defined in that area and or its relative position and or what it is doing with respect to that defined map here defined may mean that the vehicle knows the meaning of the objects in that map as shown in . The map and or the relative position of the vehicle versus that map may be dynamic and or may be continuously updated as shown in . In order to come up with this map the driverless vehicles of may use equipment such as 

Radar sensors Radar sensors may mainly be used to detect various obstacles near the driverless vehicle as shown in .

Cameras May be currently used for distinguishing the lanes and or backup assistance in the driverless vehicle as shown in .

Image processing software may detect traffic signs and or lights lane stripes and or other objects as shown in .

GPS Units Global Positioning System may be used for determining a vehicle s location by getting input from satellites as shown in .

Accelerometer may help with navigation of the driverless vehicle when the signal received from GPS devices are poor as shown in .

Ultrasound Sensor Currently ultrasound sensors may be mainly used for detecting obstacles in front and or back of the vehicle while manually and or automatically parking the driverless vehicle as shown in .

Wheel Sensor may also be used in Stability and Anti Lock braking systems another use of the wheel sensors may be to keep track of the driverless vehicle s location when the GPS systems are temporarily unavailable due to poor signals as shown in .

Laser range Finder Lidar may refer to lasers that spin in order to constantly take horizontal distance measurements. Lidar systems may include a number of infrared sensor units placed on top of the driverless vehicle . The information taken from these measurements may be combined with the information coming from cameras and or the radar in order to create a detailed map of surrounding. With this sensor taking so many measurements of the immediate surroundings of the vehicle a detailed 3D map can be produced as shown in .

Reduced Accidents Each year an estimated number of 1.3 Million people may die in traffic accidents which may be the 10th leading cause of all deaths overall and 50 million more may suffer injuries according to World Health Organization data. Widespread use of driverless vehicles may reduce this number because the leading cause of all traffic accidents may be human error. Even if there are rare machine errors and they cause deaths or injuries the total may be much less in numbers in comparison to what occurs today as shown in .

Traffic Reduction Machines may be very precise. They may be incredibly fast in reacting as well as shown in . In traffic each time a vehicle moves some seconds may be lost between two vehicles. Multiplying this by the number of all the vehicles on the highway may yield a very large number in terms of delayed traffic. Plus humans may need more of a safety gap in between vehicles due to slower reaction time. With driverless vehicles this inefficient process may be history.

Driverless vehicles e.g. the driverless vehicle may be able to react instantly to the moving traffic ahead with closer distances to each other and this may create a much more efficient and or continuous flow of traffic which may increase highway capacities even in packed situations. It may essentially create a train of vehicles on a highway. It may not only be the reaction time or shorter distance of the individual vehicles in question as shown in . By swarm robotics concepts these vehicles may also be able to communicate between themselves and or with the surroundings thanks to chips becoming cheaper and smaller and or they may very easily be placed may be even by spraying at some point on every physical object we can think of which may lead to further improvement of the communication process using the various technologies described herein increasing the safety and efficiency of driving. In the event of a traffic jam driverless vehicles may be able to communicate with one another and or allow passengers to communicate with one another and or with other driverless vehicles forming social connections e.g. to discuss the cause of the traffic as shown in .

Higher safe speeds As the reaction times and safety of driverless vehicles may be far greater than those of humans the speed limits may be increased as shown in .

More space and or easier parking The parking process may be much easier both in terms of space and time. An owner of the driverless vehicle may be dropped off wherever he she wants and or his her vehicle may park itself at a location where parking space is abundant as shown in . This may save the passenger s time and or may also help solve parking space problems as the vehicle may park far away and come back when it is needed again.

Insurance Vehicle insurance premiums may decrease. The main cause of higher premiums may be accidents and reduction in this number may make premiums cheaper.

Time Saving Instead of spending time by paying attention to the road the passenger may be able to do something more productive in their vehicle such as reading and or getting work done as shown in .

Less Vehicles and Lower Costs Overall there may be a reduced number of vehicles needed and the average cost of transportation by vehicle may decrease as shown in .

One reason may be the elimination of a redundant passenger in many cases. This may in turn increase the vehicle crying capacity of the vehicles which may mean less vehicles may be needed and it may also save on fuel overall as the weight of an unnecessary passenger may go away and less vehicles may operate on the road as shown in .

Another contributing factor may be that the people may be able to lend rent and or borrow vehicles easier shown throughout the Figures as the driverless vehicles may be able to just drive where they are needed shown in . At present most of the time vehicles just wait to be used occupying parking space. Driverless vehicles could drive and carry others instead of just waiting for its owner to use it as shown in . The operational time of driverless vehicles on average may increase which in turn may mean the same total amount of transportation we need as a society may be achieved by less number of vehicles. Today even if one wanted to lend their vehicle to someone the renter may need to come to the owner s physical location to get the vehicle and the keys. This may actually make it redundant and or very inconvenient to get a vehicle because in order to get to where the vehicle is they would need to use another vehicle or at least some sort of transportation.

Vehicle renting borrowing and taxi concepts may be transformed this way as shown in . One may not even have to be near their driverless vehicle to start their driverless vehicle . The owner of the driverless vehicle and or renter e.g. recipient may be able to enter their credentials by a phone app e.g. Fatdoor android application Fatdoor iOS application and or on the internet e.g. through Fatdoor.com and it may start the driverless vehicle through its internet connection and or the user e.g. renter owner of the driverless vehicle may tell the driverless vehicle where to go and or when to come back as shown in . There may even be internet sites e.g. Fatdoor.com Nextdoor.com and or phone apps arranging all these instantly between people who want to lend and or borrow e.g. rent as shown in . An individual may also be able to go to the street and pull a cab without a driver which may basically operate for much longer hours than a regular cab as it may have no driver to wait for when he sleeps and or eats which may mean less taxis on the road also as shown in .

There may be daily and or monthly tickets for vehicle usage such as metro train and or bus passes of today where the geospatially constrained social network local municipality a local taxi and or rental vehicle company can provide for you.

Improved transportation of goods Driverless vehicles may even be sent to do the tasks that will not need to carry passengers at all but just goods as shown in . Someone may be able to order goods online and or by phone and then send their vehicle to pick it up if a buyer does not want to wait for delivery or pay for shipping where the seller may just load the goods into the vehicle for pickup. Or the seller might do the delivery like today but as there may be no more drivers needed discussed in the shipping cost may decrease. So the retail and shipping industries may be impacted also. In many cases when we go shopping we may drive to a retail shop just to load the goods into our vehicle and bring them home unless we want to see or do something inside. Eliminating all this and just sending a driverless vehicle to pick up things may therefore have effects on the retail industry. It may also mean much free time for the owner of the driverless vehicle at home doing more useful things as shown in .

Impacts on economy Driverless vehicles may not mean losing jobs to robots. Each automation may create higher quality and more information based jobs even if it eliminates some old professions. Just like the industrial revolution replaced almost people working in the farms with machines who started doing something else other professions which may have been created by the new technologies themselves. For instance in this case taxi drivers may lessen in numbers but more people may be needed to create and or manage the software and or the process.

Fewer vehicles may mean less auto mechanics of course. Driverless vehicles may make fewer accidents too and they may drive less abusively and or in an optimum way which may mean less repair jobs per vehicle also except the regular maintenance jobs which may be needed as shown in . But again all these lost jobs and or economy due to increased efficiency of vehicle transportation may be compensated by the new professions created by the new technology.

Driverless vehicles may lead to less number of vehicles combined with increased highway capacities increased speed limits much better parking and or safer transportation as shown in . Each vehicle could operate independently reacting to events that happen as they go just like standard driving is today only robotically as shown in . Or it could function as part of an infrastructure with each vehicle working together and communicating on a mass scale of efficiency e.g. through the automobile sharing server and or massively parallel computing architecture of . With a central hub or intelligence center the driverless vehicle may communicate with all the vehicles as shown in . If there was an accident or backup the driverless vehicle to infrastructure vehicle may already know 20 minutes before it gets there thus alternating the route and avoiding the situation altogether as shown in . Driverless vehicles could offer more mobility to disadvantaged populations including the elderly and or those who are disabled who may often be unable to access adequate transportation. Older adults may be the fastest growing segment of the nation s population and access to transportation may be critical to helping individuals remain independent as they age.

Another place where adopting the technologies described herein may help our society is by improving our carbon footprint. A McKinsey research study estimates that 300 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions could be saved annually with the adoption of driverless vehicles.

The techonlogies described herein could also improve everyday efficiency by eliminating congestion and or saving time as shown in . Driverless vehicles may be able to follow the other vehicles in front of them more efficiently reducing the accordion effect that results from when vehicles follow each other in a line. This improved traffic flow could help everyone on the road whether they drive a driverless vehicle or not. The driverless vehicle may be an electric vehicle discussed in . The owner of the driverless vehicle may be able to be dropped off at their front door. The driverless vehicle may then head to the garage where it may neatly park itself over a wireless charging hotspot. The next morning it may be fully fueled and ready to go.

It will be understood with those skill in the art that in some embodiments the radial distribution module may restrict dissemination of broadcast data by verified users to claimed neighborhoods in a private neighborhood social network e.g. the geospatially constrained social network may be a private social network the neighborhood curation system described herein may also be part of the private neighborhood social network in which the broadcaster resides e.g. has a home using the radial algorithm . The geo spatially constrained social network may include online communities designed to easily create private websites to facilitate communication among neighbors and build stronger neighborhoods e.g. to help neighbors build stronger and safer neighborhoods .

Further it follows that the threshold radial distance may take on a variety of shapes other than purely circular and is defined to encompass a variety of shapes based on associated geographic historical political and or cultural connotations of associated boundaries of neighborhoods and or as defined by a city municipality government and or data provider e.g. Maponics Urban Mapping in one embodiment. For example the threshold radial distance may be based on a particular context such as a school boundary a neighborhood boundary a college campus boundary a subdivision boundary a parcel boundary and or a zip code boundary.

In an alternative embodiment the threshold radial distance generated by the geospatially constrained social network may be restricted to a shared apartment building e.g. and or an office building . In addition it will be understood with those skilled in the art that the automobile sharing server may be operate as a function of the geo spatially constrained social network e.g. a neighborhood social network .

In addition it will be understood that the automotive listing data may appear in a feed provided to users of the geo spatially constrained social network e.g. a private social network for neighbors on their profile pages based on access control privileges set by the radial broadcast module using the radial algorithm . For example access to the automotive listing data may be limited to just a claimed neighborhood e.g. as defined by neighborhood boundaries and or optionally adjacent neighborhoods.

In one embodiment the geo spatially constrained social network may provide business establishments with a separate login in which they can invite neighbors themselves. For example communications defined from one broadcasting user to an adjacent neighborhood may involve sharing information about a vehicle for rent a service for sale to rally support from neighbors from multiple neighborhoods to address civic issues to spread the word about events like local theater production or neighborhood garage sales and or to ask for advice or recommendations from the widest range of people in a community . In one embodiment the geospatially constrained social network may prevent self promotional messages that are inappropriate e.g. a user sending such messages may be suspended from the geospatially constrained social network using the crowd sourced moderation algorithm module .

In one embodiment the user may personalize nearby neighborhoods so that the user can choose exactly which nearby neighborhoods if any they wish to communicate with. The user may be able to flag a neighborhood feeds from adjacent neighborhoods. In addition leaders from a particular neighborhood may be able to communicate privately with leaders of an adjoining neighborhood to plan and organize on behalf of an entire constituency. Similarly users may be able to filter feeds to only display messages from the neighborhood that they reside in. The user may be able to restrict posts e.g. pushpin placements only in the neighborhood they are presently in. In one embodiment nearby neighbors may or may not be able to access profiles of adjacent neighborhoods.

It will also be understood that in some embodiments that users may be verified through alternate means for example through a utility bill verification e.g. to verify that a user s address on a utility bill matches the residential address they seek to claim a credit card verification e.g. or debit card verification a phone number verification e.g. reverse phone number lookup a privately published access code e.g. distributed to a neighborhood association president and or distributed at a neighborhood gathering and a neighbor vouching method e.g. in which an existing verified neighbor vouches for a new neighbor as being someone that they personally know to be living in a neighborhood.

In one embodiment the geospatially constrained social network ensures a secure and trusted environment for a neighborhood website by requiring all members to verify their address. In this embodiment verification may provide assurance the assurance that new members are indeed residing at the address they provided when registering for an account in the geo spatially constrained social network . Once a neighborhood has launched out of pilot status only members who have verified their address may be able access to their neighborhood website content.

It will be understood that among the various ways of verifying an address a user of the geo spatially constrained social network may uses the following methods to verify the address of every member 

The geo spatially constrained social network can send a postcard to the address listed on an account of the user with a unique code printed on it e.g. using the Fatmail postcard campaign . The code may allow the user to log in and verify their account.

The geo spatially constrained social network may be able to verify a home address through a credit or debit card billing address. In one embodiment billing address may be confirmed without storing personally identifiable information and or charging a credit card.

If a user has a landline phone the user may receive an automated phone call from the geo spatially constrained social network that may provide with a unique code to verify an account of the user.

A neighborhood leader of the geo spatially constrained social network can use a verify neighbors feature of the geo spatially constrained social network to vouch for and verify neighbors.

A neighbor who is a verified member of the geo spatially constrained social network can vouch for and may invite another neighbor to join the geo spatially constrained social network . Accepting such an invitation may allow the user to join the geo spatially constrained social network as a verified member according to one embodiment.

The geo spatially constrained social network can verify a home address when the user provides the last 4 digits of a SSN e.g. not stored by the geospatially constrained social network for privacy reasons .

It will be also understood that in a preferred embodiment neighborhood boundaries defined by the radial distribution module using the radial algorithm may be constrained to work in neighborhoods having a threshold number of homes e.g. 100 homes in a neighborhood and more e.g. up to thousands of homes as this may be needed to reach the critical mass of active posters that is needed to help the geo spatially constrained social network succeed. In one embodiment groups may be creatable in smaller neighborhoods having fewer than the threshold number of homes for communications in micro communities within a claimed neighborhood.

It will also be appreciated that in some embodiments a mobile driverless vehicle may be a desktop computer a laptop computer and or a non transitory broadcasting module. In addition it will be understood that the prepopulated data e.g. preseeded data described herein may not be created through data licensed from others but rather may be user generated content of organically created profiles in the geo spatial social network created by different users who have each verified their profiles.

An example embodiment is described here. Sally may have lost her job. Unable to afford car payments she may have lost he car as well. Sally may have been forced to take public transportation as a result. However buses and trains are slow and she may have been delayed several times. This may have caused her to miss interviews and professional meetings. Sally may not have a bicycle and or may live in a large city where biking may be unrealistic and or unsafe. Additionally Sally may not have enough money to take taxis every day and or may not have time to wait for a taxi service to take her call and or pick her up. This may worsen Sally s financial and personal situations making it nearly impossible for her to get back on her feet.

Luckily Sally may have a close friend who is familiar with the geospatially constrained social network . Sally s friend may recommend that Sally rent a driverless vehicle from a neighbor. Sally may use her computer to find that a family in her apartment building has an extra car that is available for rent Monday through Friday from 8 am to 6 pm. Sally may be familiar with the family and find that the rental is quite cheap. Sally may be able to easily gain access to a vehicle and be able to get to appointments on time and with ease. This may enable Sally to regain a sense of independence and or confidence. With her new reliable vehicle Sally may be relaxed as she makes it on time to the interview for her dream job. Sally may be hired for the job and be able to get her life back on track. Having experienced the convenience of renting a driverless vehicle through the automobile sharing server Sarah may decide not to get her old car back and continue renting from the family in her apartment building. Thus Sally may be able to get back on her feet and arrive at her dream job on time every day and the family that owns the driverless vehicle may be able to make a financial gain while aiding Sally.

Another example embodiment of the various disclosures described herein will now be described. John a prominent banker may have his driverless car that John lovingly named Hobbie chauffer him to downtown Dallas every morning from Monday through Friday at the Stock Tower. As a result Hobbie may remain parked at the Stocked Tower predictably between 9 15 am and 5 45 pm each and every day e.g. because sometimes John comes late and leaves early this window is known to be a predictable non transitory window in which John is at work . This time might be characterized as Hobbie s work idle time . Similarly it may be known that John never uses his driverless car Hobbie between midnight and 4 am in the morning because he is always in bed home idle time . Sometimes when John goes on vacation John may set a vacation responder on the driverless car social network as vacation idle time .

Hobbie may be connected to a driverless car social network and commerce community e.g. Fatdoor.com Nextdoor.com through a wireless internet connection. John may have self signed himself and Hobbie to join this driverless car social network and commerce community by entering a vehicle identification number of Hobbie e.g. a VIN number of Hobbie a driver s license of Hobbie . For example the driverless car social network may use an application programming interface of Hobbie e.g. Google Tesla Apple Ford General Motors Toyota Nissan Honda to verify and authenticate communicatively couple between the driverless car social network Fatdoor and Hobbie. Once coupled Hobbie may be directable to various locations and or may receive instructions for navigation through the driverless car social network. In addition when this pairing coupling has been done Hobbie may transmit its idle time e.g. work idle time and home idle time to a central server maintained by the driverless car social network.

The driverless car may employ an algorithm e.g. a radial algorithm to calculate a predictably idle window of time for Hobbie e.g. when Hobbie is not being used . In addition John may login to the driverless car social network and enter his preferences for renting Hobbie. For example John may describe how much he is willing to rent Hobbie for when Hobbie is idle e.g. by the mile and or by the hour what minimum star rating a potential rater should have before rentin and whether John wants notifications to his mobile phone whenever someone requests a rental of Hobbie when Hobbie is idle e.g. so that John can approve and or deny a rental .

Jane may not have a car and live next to where John works. She may need to leave to her office each day by 2 pm and return home at lam each morning e.g. she may have the evening shift at the hospital . This may correspond to the work idle time for Hobbie. Jane may find it convenient to search and request idle driverless cars near her through the driverless car social network. She may discover Hobbie through this driverless car social network Nextdoor.com Fatdoor.com using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in . Jane may also see that Hobbie and or his driver John have a 4 star rating e.g. for cleanliness inside the car comfort etc. . Jane may request to rent Hobbie through her mobile phone. John may receive a push notification on his phone that a person named Jane e.g. with a 5 star rating living near where he works wants to rent Hobbie during this window when Hobbie is idle e.g. for a single time and or daily for a week for 20 per day.

John may approve the rental to Hobbie to Jane based on a number of factors such as Jane s rating where she is heading how long she will need the car for and how much she is willing to pay for it using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in . Instantly Jane may pay John through her mobile phone when John accepts. In addition Hobbie may know that Jane will be coming for a ride at 2 pm. When Jane is in front of Hobbie Jane may press a button on her mobile phone to automatically unlock Hobbie s door e.g. doing this will allow Hobbie to automatically unlock his her doors because Jane would be transmitting a message to the driverless car social network which now has the ability to control Hobbie because of the pairing authentication provided by John and or verify that Jane is geospatially right next to Hobbie using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in .

Five minutes before Jane is scheduled to arrive at Hobbie e.g. at 1 55 pm Hobbie run his engine and turn on the air conditioning for Jane s arrival and perhaps tuned into her favorite classical music radio station using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in . When Jane is seated Hobbie might welcome Jane by speaking Welcome Jane I m ready to take you to work . The driverless car social network may automatically set a route and drive Jane to work. During the drive Hobbie may communicate verbally an expected time of arrival to Jane and or to John through the driverless car social network. In addition Hobbie may transmit this information to the driverless car social network which may in turn push notifications of the status of the trip to John e.g. based on his notification preferences when the car arrives and or returns to the Stock Tower using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in .

John may set Hobbie to auto charge mode. When Hobbie is running low on energy John may automatically direct Hobbie to self buy gasoline and or plug into a charging station through the driverless car social network and commerce community using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in . In addition John may instruct Hobbie through the driverless car social network and commerce community e.g. Fatdoor.com Nextdoor.com to pick up an order for weekly groceries and some fancy clothes that he recently placed at Target.com e.g. and or Walmart available at a physical store location nearby Stock Tower e.g. th Target store on Main Street using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in . This information may be communicated to Hobbie through an API to Fatdoor that Target has integrated using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in . Based on this Hobbie may dutifully drive over and go to the pickup counter at Target on Main Street. Target will know that Hobbie is arriving and a person in the warehouse area may load up the purchases that John has recently made online into Hobbie. This will free up John from doing errands that take up a significant portion of his day. The various embodiments described herein are implementable through the various technologies methods modules and or circuits described in .

Over time Jane and John may become friends in the driverless social community. In addition Jane may meet others through the driverless social community that share a similar route path as she does to work every day and who may therefore wish to carpool in Hobbie with her using the various embodiments and modules described herein and in . To save money Jane may decide to carpool with a neighbor Bob and have Hobbie pick up both of them during their driving window e.g. a fully automated Super Shuttle . For example Bob may live in Jane s apartment complex and need to leave for work everyday by 2 15. Bob may travel to a location near where Jane works about a mile away. To create incremental revenue for John John may choose to charge Jane and John less of an individual rate each e.g. but a combined rate that is 1.5 of what Jane was paying . This may allow John to make more money from Hobbie and Jane and Bob to save money individually in commuting to work. Jane John and Bob may all become friends through the driverless car social network and commerce community.
