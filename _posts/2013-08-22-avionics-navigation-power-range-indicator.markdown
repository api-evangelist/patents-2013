This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 822 061 filed on May 10 2013 entitled Avionics Navigation Travel Range Indicator which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Integrated avionics systems replace mechanical and electro mechanical instrument gauges historically used in aircraft with one or more electronic displays for displaying primary flight information such as attitude altitude heading vertical speed and so forth to the pilot. Integrated avionics systems may include one or more primary flight displays PFD and one or more multifunction displays MFD . A representative PFD displays primary flight and selected navigation information that is typically received from one or more sensor systems such as an attitude heading reference system AHRS an inertial navigation system INS one or more air data computers ADC and or navigation sensors. A representative MFD displays information for navigation and for broad situational awareness such as navigation routes flight plans information about aids to navigation including airports moving maps weather information terrain and obstacle information traffic information engine and other aircraft systems information and so forth.

An electronic device is described that includes a range indicator for conveying a range of travel until the electronic device ceases operation due to loss of power. In implementations the electronic device includes a display device a memory operable to store one or more modules and at least one processor coupled to the display device and the memory. The processor is operable to execute the one or more modules to cause display of navigation information at the display device. The navigation information includes a map graphic representing an area an aircraft is traversing. The navigation information may also include an end of use situation that represents a range of travel for the aircraft until the electronic device ceases operation due to a loss of power.

This Summary is provided solely as an introduction to subject matter that is fully described in the Detailed Description and Drawings. The Summary should not be considered to describe essential features nor be used to determine the scope of the Claims. Moreover it is to be understood that both the foregoing Summary and the following Detailed Description are example and explanatory only and are not necessarily restrictive of the subject matter claimed.

Electronic devices such as integrated avionics systems and mobile electronic devices are typically utilized by one or more members of a flight crew e.g. the pilot and or the co pilot to navigate an aircraft. Integrated avionics systems may employ primary flight display s PFDs and multifunction display s MFDs to furnish primary flight control navigational and other information to the flight crew of the aircraft. Additionally the integrated avionics systems may also employ an avionics control and display unit CDU that is configured to provide control functionality to the PFD and or the MFD and to convey navigation information representing an area the aircraft is traversing. The flight crew may also utilize mobile electronic devices within the aircraft for conveying navigation information. The PFDs MFDs and CDUs integrated flight displays are typically powered by the primary power source of the aircraft and the mobile electronic devices are typically powered by a rechargeable power source such as a battery. In the instance of the integrated flight displays the aircraft may lose a portion of the primary power source such as in the event of an electrical system failure electrical generation failure or other equipment failure. In these events one or more of the integrated flight displays may then be powered by a back up power source such as a back up battery. The back up battery may be internal to the unit or a separate component of the system. The electrical power provided by the back up power source may be a stored battery or a rechargeable battery. The power source is limited to a known measured or calculated level.

Accordingly an electronic device is described that includes range indicator functionality for conveying a range of travel until the electronic device ceases operation due to loss of power. In implementations the electronic device includes a display device a memory operable to store one or more modules and at least one processor coupled to the display device and the memory. For example the electronic device may be component of the avionics integrated systems such as one or more of the integrated flight displays or a mobile electronic device such as a tablet computing device a smartphone a portable avionics device or the like. The processor is operable to execute the one or more modules to cause display of navigation information at the display device. The navigation information may include a map graphic representing an area an aircraft is traversing. The navigation information may also include an end of use situation that represents a range of travel for the aircraft until the electronic device ceases operation due to a loss of power. In one or more implementations the modules are configured to cause the processor to alter one or more display attributes of the navigation information. For example a first region of the map graphic may be represented with a first display attribute such as a first hue and a second region of the map graphic may be represented with a second display attribute such as a second hue. The first display attribute may represent destinations within the respective regions that the aircraft may reach before the electronic device ceases to operate due to the limited power supply and the second display attribute may represent destinations for which the aircraft cannot reach before the electronic device ceases to operate.

The PFDs may be configured to display primary flight information such as aircraft attitude altitude heading vertical speed and so forth. In implementations the PFDs may display primary flight information via a graphical representation of basic flight instruments such as an attitude indicator an airspeed indicator an altimeter a heading indicator a course deviation indicator and so forth. The PFDs may also display other information providing situational awareness to the pilot such as terrain information ground proximity warning information and so forth.

As shown in primary flight information may be generated by one or more flight sensor data sources including for example one or more attitude heading angular rate and or acceleration information sources such as attitude and heading reference systems AHRS one or more air data information sources such as air data computers ADCs and or one or more angle of attack information sources. For instance the AHRSs may be configured to provide information such as attitude rate of turn slip and skid while the ADCs may be configured to provide information including airspeed altitude vertical speed and outside air temperature. Other configurations are possible.

Integrated avionics units IAUs may aggregate the primary flight information from the AHRS and ADC and provide the information to the PFDs via an avionics data bus . The IAUs may also function as a combined communications and navigation radio. For example the IAUs may include a two way VHF communications transceiver a VHF navigation receiver with glide slope a global positioning system GPS receiver and so forth. As shown each integrated avionics unit may be paired with a primary flight display which may function as a controlling unit for the integrated avionic unit. In implementations the avionics data bus may comprise a high speed data bus HSDB such as data bus complying with ARINC 429 data bus standard promulgated by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee AEEC a MIL STD 1553 compliant data bus and so forth.

The MFD displays information describing operation of the aircraft such as navigation routes moving maps engine gauges weather radar ground proximity warning system GPWS warnings traffic collision avoidance system TCAS warnings airport information and so forth that are received from a variety of aircraft systems via the avionics data bus .

In implementations the integrated avionics system employs redundant sources of primary flight information to assure the availability of the information to the pilot and to allow for cross checking of the sources of the information. For example the integrated avionics system illustrated in employs two PFDs that receive primary flight information from redundant AHRSs and ADCs via redundant IAUs. The integrated avionics system is configured so that the first PFD receives a first set of primary flight information aggregated by a first IAU from a first AHRS and ADC . Similarly the second PFD receives a second set of primary flight information aggregated by a second IAU from a second AHRS and ADC . Additionally although a single avionics data bus is illustrated in it is contemplated that redundant data buses may be employed for communication between the various components of the integrated avionics system .

In implementations primary flight information provided by either the first AHRS and ADC or the second AHRS and ADC may be displayed on either PFD or or on the MFD upon determining that the primary flight information received from either AHRS and ADC is in error or unavailable. Reversionary switches may be selected by the pilot to configure the PFDs or MFD to display primary flight information from either the first AHRS and ADC or the second AHRS and ADC . One or both of the PFDs may also be configured to display information shown on the MFD e.g. engine gauges and navigational information such as in the event of a failure of the MFD .

The integrated avionics system may employ cross checking of the primary flight information e.g. attitude information altitude information etc. to determine if the primary flight information to be furnished to either of the PFDs is incorrect. In implementations cross checking may be accomplished through software based automatic continual comparison of the primary flight information provided by the AHRS and ADC . In this manner a miss compare condition can be explicitly and proactively annunciated to warn the pilot when attitude information displayed by either PFD sufficiently disagrees. The CDUs may furnish a general purpose pilot interface to control the aircraft s avionics. For example the CDUs allow the pilots to control various systems of the aircraft such as the aircraft s autopilot system navigation systems communication systems engines and so on via the avionics data bus . In implementations the CDUs may also be used for control of the integrated avionics system including operation of the PFD and MFD . In implementations one or both of the CDUs may include a display . The display of the CDU may be used for the display of information suitable for use by the pilot of the aircraft to control a variety of aircraft systems. Further as discussed in greater detail herein below the display of the CDU may be configured to display a cursor control area to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device of the avionics system e.g. a PFD or MFD via touch input to the touch screen over the displayed cursor control area.

The CDUs may be operable to provide independent standby primary flight information to the pilot. The CDUs may be configurable to operate in a reversionary mode to provide standby primary flight information to the pilot s of the aircraft. When operating in reversionary mode the display of the CDU is used to display standby primary flight information. As shown in standby primary flight information which may include information such as attitude altitude heading vertical speed and so forth may be generated by a standby attitude and heading reference system AHRS and a standby air data computer ADC . Data generated by AHRS and ADC may be provided to one or more of the CDUs via a standby avionics data bus . In implementations one or more mode switches may be selected by the pilot to cause any number of the CDUs to operate in the first mode to display standby primary flight information. While operating in the reversionary mode the CDUs may be disconnected from the avionics data bus so that the CDUs operate independently of and communicatively isolated from the primary components of the integrated avionics system e.g. the PFDs the MFD the AHRS the ADCs and so forth . For example the CDUs may not communicate with the avionics data bus while in the first mode or may be physically disconnected from the avionics data bus e.g. via the mode switch and so on .

The processor provides processing functionality for the CDU and may include any number of processors micro controllers or other processing systems and resident or external memory for storing data and other information accessed or generated by the CDU . The processor may execute one or more software programs which implement techniques described herein. The processor is not limited by the materials from which it is formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein and as such may be implemented via semiconductor s and or transistors e.g. electronic integrated circuits ICs and so forth.

The memory is an example of computer readable media that provides storage functionality to store various data associated with the operation of the CDU such as the software programs and code segments mentioned above or other data to instruct the processor and other elements of the CDU to perform the functionality described herein. Although a single memory is shown a wide variety of types and combinations of memory may be employed. The memory may be integral with the processor stand alone memory or a combination of both. The memory may include for example removable and non removable memory elements such as RAM ROM Flash e.g. SD Card mini SD card micro SD Card magnetic optical USB memory devices and so forth.

The avionics data bus interface and the standby avionics data bus interface furnish functionality to enable the CDU to communicate with one or more avionics data buses such as the avionics data bus and standby avionics data bus respectively illustrated in .

The display may be backlit via a backlight such that it may be viewed in the dark or other low light environments.

The display may include a touch interface such as a touch screen that can detect a touch input within a specified area of the display for entry of information and commands. In implementations the touch screen may employ a variety of technologies for detecting touch inputs. For example the touch screen may employ infrared optical imaging technologies resistive technologies capacitive technologies surface acoustic wave technologies and so forth. In implementations buttons keypads knobs and so forth may be used for entry of data and commands instead of or in addition to the touch screen .

As shown in the system i.e. a CDU a PFD a MFD combinations thereof etc. includes a back up power source such as a back up battery power source that is configured to furnish power to at least partially power the system in the event the aircraft loses primary power from a primary power source e.g. primary power sources are no longer furnishing power to the PFDs the MFD the CDUs and the instrument panel of the aircraft . For example the back up power source is configured to at least substantially power the system when the aircraft is not powered by the primary power source during operation of the aircraft. In an implementation the back up power source comprises a battery that is configured to provide power to the CDU when a loss of primary power is detected. For example the back up power source may be configured to automatically furnish power to the CDU once the primary power from the primary power source ceases or at least substantially ceases to power the CDU and or the aircraft. In another example the back up power source may be configured to power the CDU upon the pilot co pilot manually causing the power source to power the CDU . The back up power source is configured to furnish power to a CDU for a minimum in some configurations pre determined amount of time to allow the pilot co pilot to utilize the CDU for a limited amount of time while the primary power is not available within the aircraft.

Although the back up power functionality described above uses the CDU as an exemplary integrated flight display the various back up power and associated display functionalities described herein may be employed by any flight display or instrument including PFD MFD CDU other integrated and portable flight displays and instruments combinations thereof and the like. For instance in one configuration back up power and associated range display functionality may be employed by any combination of the PFD MFD and CDU .

In the mobile electronic device is illustrated as including a processor and a memory .

The processor is not limited by the materials from which it is formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein and as such may be implemented via semiconductor s and or transistors e.g. electronic integrated circuits ICs and so forth.

The memory is an example of device readable storage media that provides storage functionality to store various data associated with the operation of the mobile electronic device such as the software program and code segments mentioned above or other data to instruct the processor and other elements of the mobile electronic device to perform the techniques described herein.

Accordingly the position determining module may include a variety of devices to determine position using one or more of the techniques previously described.

The position determining module for instance may use signal data received via the GPS receiver in combination with map data that is stored in the memory to show a current position on a map and so on. Position determining module may include one or more antennas to receive signal data as well as to perform other communications such as communication via one or more networks described in more detail below. The position determining module may also provide other position determining functionality such as to determine an average speed calculate an arrival time and so on.

Although a GPS system is described and illustrated in relation to it should be apparent that a wide variety of other positioning systems may also be employed such as other global navigation satellite systems GNSS terrestrial based systems e.g. wireless phone based systems that broadcast position data from cellular towers wireless networks that transmit positioning signals and so on. For example positioning determining functionality may be implemented through the use of a server in a server based architecture from a ground based infrastructure through one or more sensors e.g. gyros odometers and magnetometers use of dead reckoning techniques and so on.

The mobile electronic device may further include one or more input output I O devices e.g. a keypad buttons a wireless input device a thumbwheel input device a trackstick input device and so on . The I O devices may include one or more audio I O devices such as a microphone speakers and so on.

The mobile electronic device may also include a communication module representative of communication functionality to permit mobile electronic device to send receive data between different devices e.g. components peripherals and or over the one or more networks .

The one or more networks are representative of a variety of different communication pathways and network connections which may be employed individually or in combinations to communicate among the components of the environment . Thus the one or more networks may be representative of communication pathways achieved using a single network or multiple networks. Further the one or more networks are representative of a variety of different types of networks and connections that are contemplated including but not limited to the Internet an intranet a satellite network a cellular network a mobile data network wired and or wireless connections and so forth.

The browser may be a web browser suitable for use by a full resource device with substantial memory and processor resources e.g. a smart phone a personal digital assistant PDA etc. . However in one or more implementations the browser may be a mobile browser suitable for use by a low resource device with limited memory and or processing resources e.g. a mobile telephone a portable music device a transportable entertainment device etc. . Such mobile browsers typically conserve memory and processor resources but may offer fewer browser functions than web browsers.

In one or more implementations the mobile electronic device may also be configured to interface with the integrated avionics system within the aircraft.

For example the pilot may utilize the device to assist in navigating the aircraft to a destination in the event the integrated avionics system is no longer operational due to a power failure.

As shown in the mobile electronic device includes a power source that is configured to at least partially power the mobile electronic device . For example the power source is configured to at least substantially power the mobile electronic device . In an implementation the power source comprises a rechargeable power source such as a battery to at least substantially power the mobile electronic device during operation of the device .

The system and the mobile electronic device are illustrated as including a range indicator module which is storable in the memory and executable by the processor . The range indicator module is representative of functionality that causes the display of an end of use situation that represents when and or where the respective integrated flight display or the device may fail due to loss of power from the corresponding power source i.e. the back up power source for the integrated flight displays or the power source for the mobile electronic device . In an implementation the range indicator module is configured to cause one or more graphical representations i.e. a range of travel that convey or depict how far the aircraft can travel before the electronic device i.e. one or more of the integrated flight displays or the mobile electronic device has consumed at least substantially all of the power provided by the power source e.g. power source power source . Thus the module is configured to cause generation and display of a visualization depicting how far the aircraft can travel before an electronic device utilized for navigational purposes may lose power.

In some instances the range indicator module is configured to cause the generation of one or more displays at a display screen such as the display of the CDU or the display of the mobile electronic device . illustrate example display screens of the display of the CDU or the display of the mobile electronic device . As described above the range indicator module is configured to cause the display of an end of use situation depicting when and or where the integrated flight display s or the mobile electronic device may cease to operate due to loss of power which is described in greater detail herein.

As shown in the display screen may display navigation information which may be retrieved via the map data and or the integrated avionics systems components that represent information describing operation of the aircraft e.g. navigation routes moving maps engine gauges weather radar ground proximity warning system GPWS warnings traffic collision avoidance system TCAS warnings airport information and so forth . In one or more implementations of the present disclosure the navigation information includes a map e.g. map graphic that is configured to convey a map region pertinent to navigation of the aircraft. For example the map may display graphical representations of an area that the aircraft is traversing. The map may be configured to continually update at predetermined time intervals such that the graphical representations reflect the area being traversed with respect to movement of the aircraft i.e. a moving map .

The range indicator module is configured to cause the respective processor to generate an end of use situation such as a loss of electrical power within the map . As shown in the end of use situation may be represented as a range of travel that the aircraft can potentially travel until the electronic device i.e. the integrated flight displays or the mobile electronic device ceases operation due to loss of power from the device s respective power source. For example the module is configured to cause display of a range of travel that represents a visualization of the end of use situation at the display of the CDU . In another example the module is configured to cause display of a range of travel that represents a visualization of the end of use situation at the display of the mobile electronic device .

As shown in the range of travel may be depicted by altering the display characteristics of the navigation information . For example the range indicator module may be configured to cause a corresponding processor to alter the display characteristics of the graphics representing regions or areas outside the range of travel with respect to the display characteristics representing regions within the range of travel e.g. the circular region illustrated in and the oblong region illustrated in . Attributes of navigation information that may be altered e.g. changed modified updated comprise any discernible visual aspect feature or characteristic of the navigation information including but not limited to the hue color of the display characteristics of the graphics representing regions outside the range of travel with respect to the display characteristics representing regions within the range of travel or the brightness of the display characteristics of the graphics representing regions outside the range of travel with respect to the display characteristics representing regions within the range of travel .

The range indicator module is configured to cause display of the end of use situation based upon at least one aircraft flight characteristic. For example the module is configured to alter the display characteristics of the navigation information to furnish a visualization of the range of travel based upon aircraft flight characteristics that include but are not limited to altitude of the aircraft airspeed of the aircraft flight plan of the aircraft Winds Aloft forecasted or calculated terrain height topography navigational input of the aircraft i.e. pilot provides a navigational input to the aircraft and so forth. In one or more implementations flight characteristic information is stored within flight profile information which is storable in the memory of the CDU or the memory of the mobile electronic device . The range indicator module may calculate available range by dividing time by speed. However one or any number of additional parameters including but not limited to those listed herein can be utilized within the calculation.

For example if the back up power source is capable of providing 15 minutes of power to the MFD or other flight display the range indicator module may calculate the distance the aircraft is capable of traveling within the next 15 minutes range of travel based upon the flight characteristics of the aircraft current speed altitude etc. . In some configurations the range of travel may be calculated based on the glide characteristics of the aircraft e.g. how far the aircraft can glide based on current altitude attitude airspeed terrain and glide ratio. Additionally or alternatively the range of travel may include an estimate of the aircraft s ability to accelerate gain altitude change attitude or otherwise modify any of the flight characteristic information. The range indication may be dynamic recomputed on a regular basis to give near real time updates based upon the current inputs and or estimates of power usage estimated storage reserves aircraft dynamics and other flight characteristic.

In some implementations the module is configured to at least substantially continually monitor the power consumption to dynamically update the range of travel based upon the monitored power consumption. For example as shown in the module is configured to cause modification e.g. update alter change of the range of travel based upon the power consumption of the aircraft. The module is configured to cause a processor of the electronic device to monitor the remaining power utilized to power the electronic device. In turn the module is configured to cause the processor to update the range of travel based upon the remaining power e.g. remaining battery life . illustrates a display screen that provides a lesser range of travel with respect to the range of travel illustrated in due to continued usage of the respective power source i.e. the respective electronic device has consumed additional power with respect to the situation illustrated in as compared to the situation illustrated in . Additionally the module is configured to update the range of travel based upon the geographic position of the aircraft. In one or more implementations the geographic position of the aircraft may be provided by one or more integrated avionics units in communication with the CDU or the position determining module of the mobile electronic device .

While illustrate a range of travel delineated as a circular shape illustrates a display screen where the range of travel is delineated as an oblong shape e.g. display characteristics of the region define an oblong shape with respect to the display characteristics of the region . In this implementation the module is configured to cause the display of the range of travel based upon one or more navigational inputs provided to the aircraft. For instance the display characteristics of the regions may be altered to account for any extra power consumption due to a directional navigational input as compared to at least substantially no change in directional navigation i.e. the electronic devices may consume extra power due to a change in direction of the aircraft as compared to no or at least substantially no change in direction of the aircraft .

As shown in the range indicator module may be configured to cause display of a range of travel having varying display characteristics to represent differing likelihoods of how far the aircraft the aircraft is denoted in and with graphical representation can travel with an operational electronic device. In an implementation the module is configured to cause a corresponding processor to display an end of use situation within the display that include multiple varying display characteristics denoting a range of travel based upon a probability the aircraft can arrive at a destination within one or more specified regions e.g. regions prior to loss of power to the corresponding electronic device. For example the module is configured to cause the generation and the display of a first region having a first display characteristic within the range of travel . In this example the first region represents areas that the aircraft can arrive at a destination within the first region within a first probability range e.g. the aircraft has at or above a ninety percent 90 likelihood of arriving at a destination within the first region prior to loss of power to the electronic device . The module may be configured to generate a second region having a second display characteristic denoting that the aircraft can arrive at a destination within the second region within a second probability range e.g. the aircraft has between a fifty percent 50 and an eighty nine percent 89 likelihood of arriving at a destination within the second region prior to loss of power to the electronic device . The module may also be configured to generate a third region having a third display characteristic denoting that the aircraft can arrive at a destination within the third region within a third probability range e.g. the aircraft has between a five percent 5 and a forty nine percent 49 likelihood of arriving at a destination within the third region prior to loss of power to the electronic device . As described with respect to the module may be configured to continually update the various regions according to the continued consumption of power by the electronic device during operation of the aircraft and according to the flight characteristics described above. It is understood that the module may be configured to cause the display of more or less probability regions according to the requirements of the electronic device and or the pilot s preferences. For example in some configurations the module may utilize shading to differentiate between regions such as by providing a gradual transition from light to dark as the likelihood of arriving at a displayed location decreases e.g. nearby areas are unshaded far areas are darkened with a gradual continuum of shading therebetween . In some embodiments the colors levels and types of shading may be user configurable.

In one or more implementations range indicator module is configured to cause a corresponding processor to generate a visual alert or indication to convey to the pilot or the co pilot that the respective electronic device has entered an end of use situation mode of operation. For example a pilot or a co pilot may have caused the display of navigational information in such a manner that the end of use situation may be difficult to discern i.e. the pilot or the co pilot have zoomed in or zoomed out within the map such that the end of use situation may not be substantially displayed within the corresponding display . In one or more implementations the visual alert may comprise a pop up graphic a visual graphic that delineates the range of travel with respect to the remaining areas of the map or the like. Further in some configurations the visual alert the map and or other data associated with the end of use situation may be presented in a three dimensional format utilizing 2D or 3D display technology. In some configurations a head up display HUD and or a helmet mounted display HMD may be utilized to present the visual alert the map and or other data associated with the end of use situation such as the range of travel .

As shown in an end of use situation is determined Block to provide a visual representation of when and or where the mobile electronic device ceases to operate. The range indicator module is configured to determine e.g. generate an end of use situation e.g. end of use situation end of use situation based upon one or more flight characteristics as described above and or the remaining power within the power source utilized to power the electronic device. Thus the range indicator module is configured to determine an end of use situation to depict a range of travel of the aircraft before the electronic device loses power. The end of use situation is displayed at the display of the electronic device Block . As described above with respect to the range indicator module is configured to cause the display of navigation information which includes a map at the corresponding display of the electronic device. Upon determining the end of use situation the module is configured to cause display of the end of use situation at a display in communication with the electronic device. For example as described above a range of travel that conveys a visualization of the end of use situation may be displayed at the display of the CDU or the display of the mobile electronic device .

In some configurations a simple distance display indicating the numerical value of the range of travel may be utilized instead of or in addition to the map functionality described above. For example a device lacking the ability to graphically present a map may still employ the techniques described herein the calculate the range of travel or other data associated with the end of use situation for simple display to the pilot independent of the map .

As the aircraft traverses the airspace the end of use situation is updated Block to reflect changes in the end of use situation based upon the flight characteristics and power consumption of the electronic device. Data representing the flight characteristics and the remaining power source power are retrieved Block . For instance in the implementation illustrated the range indicator module is configured to retrieve data representing the remaining power within the power source i.e. retrieve the remaining battery life and data representing flight characteristic information e.g. an altitude of the aircraft an airspeed of the aircraft a flight plan of the aircraft a Winds and Temperatures Aloft Forecast a terrain height a navigational input etc. . The geographic position of the aircraft is determined Block . For example the geographic position of aircraft may be determined by the integrated avionics units that are in communication with the CDU or the position determining module of the mobile electronic device . In an implementation the range indicator module is configured to cause a respective processor i.e. processor processor to alter the display characteristics of the displayed range of travel e.g. range of travel range of travel to account for the change in geographic position the change in remaining power or changes in flight characteristics of the aircraft.
