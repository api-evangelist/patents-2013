The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 835 688 filed Jun. 17 2013 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.

The present invention relates generally to electronic circuits and more particularly to power dividing and or power combining circuits.

Millimeter wave communication radar electronic warfare systems also known as microwave systems conventionally use amplifiers to increase the power output signal level. An increase in the output power for the microwave system achieves many advantages e.g. improved operating range improved communications and the like.

In order to amplify the microwave transmission signal conventionally the signal is divided by a splitter having one input and two outputs so that one output signal is coupled as an input signal to one amplifier while the other output signal is connected as an input signal to the other amplifier. The outputs from the amplifiers are then connected to a combiner so that the output signal from the combiner is equal to the input signal amplified by the two amplifiers minus any losses in the splitter or combiner.

Furthermore the splitter also known as a divider is identical to a combiner but used in the reverse direction. For example a splitter or divider would have one input and two outputs while the combiner has two inputs and one output so that the divider component is a mirror image of the combiner component. For that reason the term combiner divider is used interchangeably since a divider may be used either as a divider or a combiner depending upon the fashion in which it is connected to the amplifier circuit.

In order to achieve efficient power amplifier designs for microwave communications it is critical that the path length from the outputs of the splitter and to the inputs of the combiner be equal. Otherwise the signals from the amplifiers do not add constructively and power is lost. Likewise it is necessary that the phase shift if any from the outputs of the splitter and to the inputs of the combiner be the same for each amplifier in order for the power output signals from the amplifiers to add or combine constructively.

One inherent problem with power signal level amplification in microwave systems is that the power amplifiers located between the divider and the combiner each exhibits an input reflection coefficient so that a portion of the signal provided by the divider to the power amplifier is reflected back to the input of the power amplifier circuit. This reflected signal effectively reduces the overall power input to the power amplifiers. This in turn reduces the overall efficiency of the power amplifier.

In order to reduce the adverse effects of the reflected power from the power amplifiers there have been previously known balanced microwave power amplifier circuits which eliminated or at least greatly reduced the adverse effect of reflected power from the power amplifiers. These previously known balanced amplifier circuits included a first phase delay of 90 in between the divider output and the first amplifier while the output from the first amplifier was connected as an input signal to the combiner. Conversely the input of a second amplifier was connected directly to a second output from the divider while the output from the second amplifier was electrically connected through a 90 phase shift delay line to a second input of the combiner. In operation and assuming that both amplifiers are identical in operation to each other a reflected signal from the first amplifier exhibits a phase shift of 180 at the output from the divider since the signal ultimately resulting in the reflected signal passes through the 90 delay line twice. Conversely the phase of the reflection from the second amplifier back to the divider exhibits 0 phase shift relative to the one reflected from the first amplifier. Since the magnitudes of the reflected signals from both amplifiers are equal the reflected signals from the two amplifiers cancel each other.

These previously known balanced combiner microwave power amplifier circuits however have been limited to a two amplifier configuration between the divider and the combiner. In many situations however a simple two amplifier circuit produces insufficient output power for the microwave system.

In some circumstances it may be possible to cascade two or more balanced power amplifier circuits together to increase the overall power output of the microwave system. However the addition of extra divider combiner pairs each having a pair of power amplifiers electrically connected there between increases the overall size and bulk of the microwave power system. In many situations such as microwave millimeter wave integrated circuits MMICs the cascading of multiple balanced pairs of amplifiers is simply impractical due to the limited space available on the MMIC substrate.

The present invention provides power dividing and or power combining circuits having at least three electronic devices that overcome all of the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known power amplifier circuits or other similar circuits.

In one embodiment a power dividing and or power combining circuit may include one or more inputs one or more outputs at least three electrical pathways and at least three electronic devices with substantially equal signal reflection between the one or more inputs and the one or more outputs. At least one electronic device is provided in each of the electrical pathways. A plurality of phase shift components are further provided with at least one phase shift component electrically connected in series with the electronic devices in each of the electrical pathways. The phase shift components are selected so that a vector sum of the reflected signals from the electronic devices to the one or more inputs and or the one or more outputs is substantially minimized.

Circuits according this embodiment may be configured as i a divider having one input and a plurality of outputs and a splitter generating inputs to the pathways from the one input with outputs from the pathways providing the plurality of outputs ii a combiner having a plurality of inputs and one output and an adder generating the one output from outputs from the pathways with inputs to the pathways providing the plurality of inputs or iii a divider combiner having one input and one output a splitter generating inputs to the pathways from the one input and an adder generating the one output from outputs from the pathways. When configured as iii a power divider combiner the total signal phase shift between the multiple paths as measured between the one input and the one output is substantially equal to zero.

Depending of the particular circuit application the electronic devices may include amplifiers switches attenuators mixers antenna elements e.g. phased array elements etc. For example in a three amplifier system embodiment the input of one amplifier is connected directly to the output from the divider while a phase shift component equal to 120 is electrically connected in series from the output of the first amplifier and to a first input of the combiner. For the second amplifier a 60 phase shift component is electrically connected in between both the input to the second amplifier and the output from the divider as well as between the output from the second amplifier and a second input to the combiner. Lastly a phase shift component of 120 is electrically connected between the third output from the divider and the input of the third amplifier while the output from the third amplifier is connected with no additional phase delay as an input signal to the third input of the combiner.

In the operation of the three amplifier system and assuming ideal operation of the amplifiers and also that the amplifiers are identical in operation to each other a portion of the input signal is reflected by the first amplifier back to the input which is in phase with the incoming signal. Conversely the reflected signal from the second amplifier at the input is equal in magnitude but offset 120 from the reflected signal from the first amplifier. Similarly the third amplifier reflects a signal equal in amplitude to the reflected signals of both the first and second amplifiers but with a phase shift of 240 .

Since the reflected signals from the amplifiers at the input to the power amplifier circuit are equal in amplitude but angularly offset from each other by 120 these three reflected vector signals when combined cancel and thus eliminate or at least minimize signal loss at the input to the power amplifier circuit.

For circuits containing four or more electronic devices the actual selection of the delay component will differ in order to produce a reflected signal at the input which vectorally cancels thus resulting in zero or at least low signal loss.

In another embodiment a power dividing and or power combining circuit may include one or more inputs one or more outputs at least three electrical pathways and at least three electronic devices with substantially equal signal reflection between the one or more inputs and the one or more outputs. At least one electronic device is provided in each of the electrical pathways. A serial bus extends from the one or more input and the one or more outputs the serial bus having serially connected impedance providing components positioned between the electrical pathways the impedance providing components increasing in impedance from one end and to the other end of the serial bus in an amount sufficient to produce a substantially equal amount of power to each of at least three electronic devices.

Circuits according this embodiment may be configured as i a divider having one input and a plurality of outputs wherein the serial bus generates inputs to the pathways from the one input with outputs from the pathways providing the plurality of outputs ii a combiner having a plurality of inputs and one output wherein the serial bus generates the one output from outputs of the pathways with inputs to the pathways providing the plurality of the inputs or iii a divider combiner having one input and one output wherein a first of the serial bus generates inputs to the multiple pathways from the one input and a second of the serial bus generates the one output from outputs from the multiple paths. When configured as iii the combiner divider the total signal phase shift between the multiple paths as measured at the one input and the one output is substantially equal to zero.

In general the power dividing and or power combining circuits described herein have inputs outputs at least three electrical pathways and at least three electronic devices between the inputs and the outputs. At least one electronic device may be provided in each of the electrical pathways. Depending on the configuration of the inputs outputs the pathways and the electronic devices may be connected in parallel between the inputs and outputs. The electronic devices have substantially equal signal reflection at the inputs and or the outputs. For example the electronic devices may have input reflection coefficients and substantially equal output reflection coefficients. While the embodiments illustrated in the figures generally show a power amplifier as an electronic device it should be appreciated that the circuits may include other electronic devices as well. For instance the electronic devices may include amplifiers switches attenuators mixers antenna elements e.g. phased array elements etc.

With reference first to a millimeter wave e.g. 32 gigahertz power amplifier circuit is illustrated. It should be appreciated that the amplifier circuit may be used for other frequency bands and applications. The circuit may be configured for operation in the frequency range 0.1 1000 GHz in some instances. Here the circuit is configured as both a power divider and a power combiner. More particularly the power amplifier circuit includes both a power input as well as a power output with multiple electrical pathways e.g. three as illustrated provided between the power input and the power output including respective electronic devices. The entire power amplifier circuit may be implemented as an MMIC in some embodiments.

The power dividing portion of the circuit includes the power input connected to a signal splitter which splits an input signal to input into three inputs and to the multiple pathways including the electronic devices such as amplifiers and . Ideally the splitter evenly divides the input signal to the power input so that the power signal levels at each of inputs and to the multiple pathways are not only equal in magnitude but also equal in phase to each other. If inputs and are separately desired or provided for in the circuit a splitter element dividing an input signal into multiple signals may not be needed. Ideally the signal splitter exhibits a constant phase shift of the signals between power input and the inputs and to the multiple pathways and likewise introduces negligible signal loss for the circuit .

Similarly the power combining portion of the circuit has a signal adder which receives signals from three outputs and of the multiple pathways and combines them into single signal for output at the power output . If separate outputs are desired or provided for in the circuit an adder element combining the outputs and into one output signal may not be needed.

Ideally the signal adder exhibits a constant phase shift of the signals between outputs and of the multiple pathways and the power output and likewise introduces negligible signal loss for the circuit . Furthermore the adder may be identical to the splitter but electrically connected in the reverse direction. In some embodiments splitter and adder may be conventional elements.

Still referring to a first amplifier has its input connected to the first output from the splitter . The output from the first amplifier is then connected through two 60 phase shift components which are connected in series from the output from the amplifier and to the first input of the adder . Alternatively a single phase shift component of 120 may be substituted for the two series phase shift components .

A second amplifier is connected in series with the second output from the divider through a 60 phase shift component . The output from the second amplifier is connected through a 60 phase shift component to the second input of the adder .

Lastly a third amplifier has its input connected through two 60 phase shift components to the third output from the splitter . The output from the third amplifier is connected to the third input of the adder .

Ideally the three amplifiers and are identical or substantially identical to each other so that all three amplifiers and exhibit substantially identical signal reflection due to impedance mismatch at the input of each amplifier and . Additionally the phase shift components and may take any construction but preferably are in the form of a signal delay line.

With reference now to in operation the signal on the input to the circuit is divided into three inputs and of equal power and same phase to the multiple pathways. Due to the impedance mismatch at the first amplifier a portion of the signal is reflected by the first amplifier back to the input . This reflected signal is illustrated by vector having a magnitude or length and a phase shift of 0 since it is taken as the reference signal.

The output from the first amplifier is connected through the two 60 phase shift components to the adder input . Consequently the total phase shift from the input and to the output equals 120 .

Similarly one third of the power at the input flows through the phase delay component to the input of the second amplifier . A portion of that power is reflected due to impedance mismatch back through the phase shift component and to the input . This reflected power is illustrated in as vector . The vector has the same magnitude or length as the first vector assuming zero signal loss in the phase shift component but is offset in phase by 120 due to the two signal passages through the 60 phase shift component .

The output from the second amplifier is connected through a single 60 phase shift component to the second input of the combiner . Consequently the overall phase shift from the input and to the output is equal to 120 i.e. the same for the first amplifier .

Lastly the signal from the third output of the splitter passes through the two 60 phase delay components and to the input of the third amplifier . A portion of that signal is then reflected due to impedance mismatch back through the two phase shift components to the input so that the total phase shift for the reflected signal from the third amplifier equals 240 .

The reflected image from the third amplifier is illustrated in as vector . The vector has a magnitude of length the same or at least substantially the same as the vectors and but has a phase offset of 240 from the first vector . These three vectors and however when combined effectively cancel each other both in magnitude as well as in phase. This in turn results in essentially zero or extremely low loss for signal entering the input to the three amplifiers in amplifier circuit .

In addition the overall phase delay from the input through the amplifier and to the output equals 120 i.e. the same as the other amplifiers and . As such all three signals at the output are in phase with each other at the output for maximum signal strength. Furthermore even in the event that the amplifiers and introduce a phase delay of the phase shift caused by each amplifier and will be identical so that the signals at the output from the adder remain in phase with each other. By the same token an introduction of a phase shift by the amplifiers and would merely rotate the vector diagram illustrated in by an angular amount equal to but would still result in cancellation of the vectors and .

The foregoing example of three amplifiers was by way of example only. Rather any arbitrary numbers of at least three amplifiers odd or even may be used provided that the phase shift components are properly selected for example between the splitter and the adder to produce reflected power signals from the amplifiers which cancel each other.

For example with reference now to a power amplifier circuit having four amplifiers namely a first amplifier second amplifier third amplifier and fourth amplifier is shown interconnected between an input and output of the power amplifier circuit .

A 135 phase delay circuit is connected between the input to the first amplifier and the signal splitter while the output from the first amplifier is connected to the signal added . The opposite is true for the fourth amplifier i.e. the input of the fourth amplifier is connected to the splitter while its output is connected through a 135 phase shift component to the adder .

A 90 phase shift component is connected between the splitter and the input of the second amplifier while the output from the second amplifier is connected through a 45 phase shift component to the combiner . Lastly a 45 phase shift component is connected between the splitter and input to the third amplifier while the output from the third amplifier is connected through a 90 phase shift component to the adder .

Consequently and with reference to a portion of the signal from the input is reflected by the first amplifier back to the input. That reflected signal passes through the 135 phase shift component thus producing a total phase shift of 270 and a magnitude illustrated by the length of the vector in . Similarly a portion of the signal from the input to the second amplifier passes through the 90 phase shift component twice thus resulting in a 180 phase shift illustrated at vector in .

Similarly a portion of the signal from the input is reflected by the third amplifier twice through the 45 phase shift component thus resulting in a 90 phase shift illustrated by vector in . The signal reflected back to the input by the fourth amplifier has no phase shift and thus results in a vector in having a zero phase shift.

Ideally the amplifiers and or other electronic devices are all identical to each other so that the magnitude of the reflected signal back to the input is identical for each amplifier and represented by the length of each vector . The vectors when added or combined together completely cancel out thus resulting in substantially zero power loss. Furthermore the phase shift components and which are connected between the amplifiers and and the combiner ensure that the total phase shift between the input and output for the power amplifier circuit remains the same or approximately 135 plus any phase shift resulting from the amplifier itself.

In order to adjust the phase shift amount of the phase shift components for N electronic devices e.g. amplifiers the amount of phase shift for each sequential amplifier equals 1 180 N 2 180 N 3 180 N . . . N 1 180 N . Or put another way where the circuit includes N electronic devices and at least N 1 signal delay line components connected in series with the N electronic devices power reflected from each electronic device to the input should exhibits a phase shift of 180 N degrees or a multiples thereof with respect to other electronic devices.

With reference now to a circuit is configured as a power divider having one input and a plurality of outputs which provide a plurality of inputs to multiple electrical pathways depending from the serial bus. Here the serial bus is illustrated for equally dividing a signal at its input into four signals of equal power at its four outputs and . The phase shift of the signal varies at each of the output ports . As will be described subsequently in greater detail the circuit when configured as a power dividing circuit a power combining circuit or both automatically corrects these phase shifts.

More specifically an input signal at the input first passes through a phase shift component having a fixed phase shift e.g. 90 and a fixed characteristic impedance e.g. 25 ohms to a common node . Power from the common node then provides power to all four outputs and . The outputs and may subsequently provide inputs to electrical pathways having electronic devices such as amplifiers as further illustrated in .

In particular the node is electrically connected to the first output by an impedance component having a zero phase shift and a fixed impedance of 50 ohms. The node is then connected to a node by a phase shift component having a fixed phase shift of 45 and an impedance of 16.6 ohms. Since the characteristic impedance of the phase shift component is one third of the characteristic impedance of the phase shift component one quarter of the power from the node flows to the first outlet while three quarters of the power from the node flows to the node .

The node is connected by an impedance component having impedance of 50 ohms and a zero phase shift to the second output . The node is also connected to a node by a phase shift component having a phase shift of 45 and an impedance of 25 ohms. Since the impedance of the phase shift component is one half the impedance of the impedance component one third of the power from the node passes to the output while two thirds of the power passes through the phase shift component to the node .

The node is connected to the third outlet through an impedance component having an impedance of 50 ohms and a zero phase shift. The node is also connected to the first outlet by a phase shift component having a phase shift of 45 and an impedance of 50 ohms. Since the phase shift component has the same impedance as the impedance component the power at node is evenly divided between the third outlet and fourth outlet .

Consequently it can be seen that the serial bus evenly distributes power from its input to its four outputs and . However as described below the signals at the divider outputs are phase shifted relative to each other.

With reference now to a circuit is illustrated which is configured as a divider combiner. Here the circuit of is shown as a signal divider for the power dividing portion of the circuit having an input and also as a signal combiner for the power combining portion of the circuit having an output . The circuit illustrated in thus is configured as a divider combiner having one input and one output . A first serial bus generates inputs to the multiple pathways from the one input and a second serial bus generates the one output from outputs from the multiple paths. In this configuration the total signal phase shift between the multiple paths as measured at the one input and the one output is substantially equal to zero.

It should be appreciated though that the power dividing and power combining portions of the circuit may be similarly function as stand alone circuits in other embodiments. For instance a power dividing circuit may have one input and a plurality of outputs where the serial bus generates inputs to the pathways from the one input with outputs from the pathways providing the plurality of outputs. And a power combing circuit may have a plurality of inputs and one output where the serial bus generates the one output from outputs of the pathways with inputs to the pathways providing the plurality of the inputs.

When the serial bus is employed as a combiner the inputs and illustrated in now act as signal outputs and respectively. It is noted that the combiner may be thought of as being oriented upside down with respect to the divider in so as to be function in a reversed manner. Four power amplifiers are located along the four electrical pathways between the divider and combiner so that one power amplifier is electrically connected between the divider output and the combiner input while one amplifier is connected between the divider output and the combiner input . Similarly one amplifier is electrically connected between the divider output and the combiner input while one amplifier is electrically connected between the divider output and the combiner input . Ideally all four amplifiers are identical in operation to each other.

With reference now to both the phase shift of a reflection from the amplifier at the node from the divider output will equal a zero phase shift and thus result in the vector illustrated in . Each impedance providing component may be configured to create a phase shift equal to 180 N or a multiple thereof where N equals the number of electronic devices.

The power that is reflected by the amplifier through the second divider output passes twice through the phase shift component thus resulting in an overall phase shift of 90 corresponding to vector in . Similarly the reflected power from the amplifier from the third divider output passes through the phase shift components and twice thus resulting in an overall phase shift of 180 as shown by vector . Similarly a reflected signal from the power amplifier through the output passes twice through the phase shift components and thus resulting in an overall phase shift of 270 which corresponds to vector in . As before the vectors all cancel each other thus minimizing or eliminating signal reflection from all amplifier at the input with minimal signal power loss input into the amplifiers .

In addition to an equal distribution of power by the divider the total phase shift from node in the divider to the corresponding node in the combiner is identical for each amplifier path and is equal to 135 plus any phase shift caused by the amplifiers . For example the signal passing from node in the divider through the first output must pass through all three phase shift components and when employed as a combiner in the combiner thus resulting in a total phase shift of 135 .

Phase shift components and components with different impedances have been described for controlling the power distribution and phase shift of the various circuits described herein. In some instances for example the phase shift components and or impedance providing components may be transmissions lines having a predetermined length having a characteristic impedance and a predetermined length. Examples of transmission lines may include microstrip lines striplines co planar waveguides or waveguides. The magnitude and or phase of the transmission lines may be judiciously selected to provide desired electrical characteristics. For instance the electronic length of the transmission lines may dictate the phase shift or delay of the signal.

For a microstrip line or stripline configuration the line may have a conductor on top of a ground plane with a dielectric there between. The longer in length of the line the greater delay may be achieved. For a given thickness of the dielectric the characteristic impedance can be changed by changing the width of the top conductor from a relative base line e.g. which may be 50 ohm characteristic impedance . If the conductor is made narrower the characteristic impedance is increased. Whereas if the conductor is made wider the characteristic impedance is decreased. And the magnitude of the signal may be dictated by changing the impedance of the transmission line to be different from the input impedance. For a waveguide configuration the waveguide may be a conventional waveguide e.g. a standard waveguide size or a modified custom form to achieve different wave impedance thereof. And for a co planar waveguide CPW configuration the structure may a conventional CPW and or modified custom form thereof which includes spacing of different conductors supporting wave propagation located on the same plane on top of a dielectric substrate. The median strip is the signal line and the two surrounding strips serve as grounds. For a waveguide or CPW changing the dimensions thereof generally changes the characteristic impedance and phase shift as one skilled in the art appreciates. However it should be appreciated that other phase shifting and impedance providing means may be used without deviating from the spirit or scope of the invention

The power dividing and or power combining circuit embodiments described herein may be applicable for RF to submillimeter wave signals when used in power amplifier configuration demonstrated minimum reflected signal at the input or output. The technique combines and cancels reflections of multiple any number amplifiers. The technique also eliminates the need for expensive bulky and RF lossy isolators required at the input output of conventional power amplifiers thus reducing system costs.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a novel power amplifier circuit as well as an improved divider combiner for microwave millimeter wave circuitry or microwave systems. Having described our invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
