The present application relates to novel substituted imidazo 1 2 a pyridine 3 carboxamides to processes for their preparation to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases in particular for the treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitric oxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to attach to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.

Through the production of cGMP and the regulation resulting therefrom of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system may be suppressed which may lead for example to high blood pressure platelet activation increased cellular proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.

Compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of haem. Besides the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.

Over the last years a number of substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly. i.e. without prior release of NO have been described for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 fatty acids Goldberg et al. 252 1977 1279 diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate Pettibone et al. 116 1985 307 isoliquiritigenin Yu et al. 114 1995 1587 and also various substituted pyrazole derivatives WO 98 16223 .

The present invention further relates to medicinal products that contain at least one compound according to the invention usually together with one or more inert non toxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients and use thereof for the aforementioned purposes.

The compounds according to the invention can have systemic and or local action. For this purpose they can be applied in a suitable way e.g. by oral parenteral pulmonary nasal sublingual lingual buccal rectal dermal transdermal conjunctival or otic administration or as implant or stent.

For these routes of application the compounds according to the invention can be administered in suitable dosage forms.

Dosage forms functioning according to the prior art for rapid and or modified release of the compounds according to the invention which contain the compounds according to the invention in crystalline and or amorphized and or dissolved form e.g. tablets uncoated or coated tablets for example with enteric coatings or coatings with delayed dissolution or insoluble coatings which control the release of the compound according to the invention tablets or films wafers that disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity films lyophilizates capsules for example hard or soft gelatin capsules sugar coated pills granules pellets powders emulsions suspensions aerosols or solutions are suitable for oral administration.

Parenteral administration can take place avoiding an absorption step e.g. intravenous intraarterial intracardiac intraspinal or intralumbar or including absorption e.g. intramuscular subcutaneous intracutaneous percutaneous or intraperitoneal .

For oral application the dosage is about 0.001 to 2 mg kg preferably about 0.001 to 1 mg kg body weight.

Nevertheless it may optionally be necessary to deviate from the stated amounts namely depending on body weight route of administration individual response to the active substance type of preparation and time point or interval when application takes place. Thus in some cases it may be sufficient to use less than the aforementioned minimum amount whereas in other cases the stated upper limit must be exceeded. When applying larger amounts it may be advisable to distribute these in several individual doses throughout the day.
