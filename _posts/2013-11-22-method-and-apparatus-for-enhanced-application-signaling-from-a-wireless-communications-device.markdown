The present application for patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61 827 865 entitled MODEM API FOR QRD TO INDICATE REACHABILITY filed May 28 2013 and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.

Aspects of the present disclosure relate generally to wireless communication systems and more particularly to enhanced application signaling from a wireless communications device.

Wireless communication networks are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as telephony video data messaging broadcasts and so on. Such networks which are usually multiple access networks support communications for multiple users by sharing the available network resources. One example of such a network is the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network UTRAN . The UTRAN is the radio access network RAN defined as a part of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS a third generation 3G mobile phone technology supported by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP . The UMTS which is the successor to Global System for Mobile Communications GSM technologies currently supports various air interface standards such as Wideband Code Division Multiple Access W CDMA Time Division Code Division Multiple Access TD CDMA and Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access TD SCDMA . The UMTS also supports enhanced 3G data communications protocols such as High Speed Packet Access HSPA which provides higher data transfer speeds and capacity to associated UMTS networks.

As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase research and development continue to advance the UMTS technologies not only to meet the growing demand for mobile broadband access but to advance and enhance the user experience with mobile communications.

In some wireless communication networks the transmission of connectivity signals e.g. keep alive signals between a user equipment and application server may cause unwanted signaling overhead in an operator s wireless communication network because of the large number of applications that are running on user equipment and that are frequently sending updates to their respective application servers Even more the foregoing signaling overhead may often lead to degradations in wireless communication. Additionally the excessive transmission of connectivity signals may cause an increased use of user equipment resources such as battery resources.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the one or more aspects comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative features of the one or more aspects. These features are indicative however of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of various aspects may be employed and this description is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.

The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.

The present aspects generally relate to enhancements in application signaling from a wireless communications device. Specifically a user equipment UE may contain one or more applications that communicate with a respective server e.g. an application server through a wireless communication system. Further the UE may generally transmit connectivity signals e.g. keep alive signals to the server so that the server may be made aware that the application is reachable through the wireless communication system. An UE and or application executing on the UE may be considered reachable when it is in an active mode and or when signals transmitted to the UE and or application via the wireless communications system are likely to be received processed and or handled by the UE and or application. Thus reachability may refer to the degree level and or probability of the UE and or the application being reachable by the server through the wireless communication system.

The UE may transmit the connectivity signals in a scheduled e.g. periodic manner however non scheduled transmission may also be supported. In some non limiting cases however the transmission of connectivity signals to the server may be deemed inefficient. For example multiple keep alive signals may be transmitted to indicate reachability of the UE even when little has changed in terms of the reachability conditions of the UE. In such cases not only is power consumed by the UE to perform the transmissions but the large number of signals transmitted may have an effect on the wireless communications network and or the application server receiving the signals. As such according to the present apparatus and methods an adjustment of the transmission of connectivity signals to a server from an application on the UE may be made to enhance signaling from the application. Accordingly in some aspects the present methods and apparatus may provide an efficient solution as compared to current solutions to more effectively utilize the transmission of connectivity signals for signaling from the application.

The various concepts presented throughout this disclosure may be implemented across a broad variety of telecommunication systems network architectures and communication standards. By way of example and without limitation the aspects of the present disclosure illustrated in are presented with reference to a UMTS system employing a W CDMA air interface. A UMTS network includes three interacting domains a Core Network CN a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network UTRAN and UE . In this example the UE may include the reachability component and the modem component of . Although not shown the UE may also include the transmission component the interface module the one or more applications and the operating system module described above. In this example the UTRAN provides various wireless services including telephony video data messaging broadcasts and or other services. The UTRAN may include a plurality of Radio Network Subsystems RNSs such as an RNS each controlled by a respective Radio Network Controller RNC such as an RNC . Here the UTRAN may include any number of RNCs and RNSs in addition to the RNCs and RNSs illustrated herein. The RNC is an apparatus responsible for among other things assigning reconfiguring and releasing radio resources within the RNS . The RNC may be interconnected to other RNCs not shown in the UTRAN through various types of interfaces such as a direct physical connection a virtual network or the like using any suitable transport network.

Communication between a UE and a Node B may be considered as including a physical PHY layer and a medium access control MAC layer. Further communication between a UE and an RNC by way of a respective Node B may be considered as including a radio resource control RRC layer. In the instant specification the PHY layer may be considered layer 1 the MAC layer may be considered layer 2 and the RRC layer may be considered layer 3. Information hereinbelow utilizes terminology introduced in the RRC Protocol Specification 3GPP TS 25.331 v9.1.0 incorporated herein by reference.

The geographic region covered by the RNS may be divided into a number of cells with a radio transceiver apparatus serving each cell. A radio transceiver apparatus is commonly referred to as a Node B in UMTS applications but may also be referred to by those skilled in the art as a base station BS a base transceiver station BTS a radio base station a radio transceiver a transceiver function a basic service set BSS an extended service set ESS an access point AP or some other suitable terminology. For clarity three Node Bs are shown in each RNS however the RNSs may include any number of wireless Node Bs. The Node Bs provide wireless access points to a CN for any number of mobile apparatuses. Examples of a mobile apparatus include a cellular phone a smart phone a session initiation protocol SIP phone a laptop a notebook a netbook a smartbook a personal digital assistant PDA a satellite radio a global positioning system GPS device a multimedia device a video device a digital audio player e.g. MP3 player a camera a game console or any other similar functioning device. The mobile apparatus is commonly referred to as a UE in UMTS applications but may also be referred to by those skilled in the art as a mobile station a subscriber station a mobile unit a subscriber unit a wireless unit a remote unit a mobile device a wireless device a wireless communications device a remote device a mobile subscriber station an access terminal a mobile terminal a wireless terminal a remote terminal a handset a terminal a user agent a mobile client a client or some other suitable terminology. In a UMTS system the UE may further include a universal subscriber identity module USIM which contains a user s subscription information to a network. For illustrative purposes one UE is shown in communication with a number of the Node Bs . The DL also called the forward link refers to the communication link from a Node B to a UE and the UL also called the reverse link refers to the communication link from a UE to a Node B . UE may also include reachability component and modem component .

The CN interfaces with one or more access networks such as the UTRAN . As shown the CN is a GSM core network. However as those skilled in the art will recognize the various concepts presented throughout this disclosure may be implemented in a RAN or other suitable access network to provide UEs with access to types of CNs other than GSM networks.

The CN includes a circuit switched CS domain and a packet switched PS domain. Some of the circuit switched elements are a Mobile services Switching Centre MSC a Visitor location register VLR and a Gateway MSC. Packet switched elements include a Serving GPRS Support Node SGSN and a Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN . Some network elements like EIR HLR VLR and AuC may be shared by both of the circuit switched and packet switched domains. In the illustrated example the CN supports circuit switched services with a MSC and a GMSC . In some applications the GMSC may be referred to as a media gateway MGW . One or more RNCs such as the RNC may be connected to the MSC . The MSC is an apparatus that controls call setup call routing and UE mobility functions. The MSC also includes a VLR that contains subscriber related information for the duration that a UE is in the coverage area of the MSC . The GMSC provides a gateway through the MSC for the UE to access a circuit switched network . The GMSC includes a home location register HLR containing subscriber data such as the data reflecting the details of the services to which a particular user has subscribed. The HLR is also associated with an authentication center AuC that contains subscriber specific authentication data. When a call is received for a particular UE the GMSC queries the HLR to determine the UE s location and forwards the call to the particular MSC serving that location.

The CN also supports packet data services with a serving GPRS support node SGSN and a gateway GPRS support node GGSN . GPRS which stands for General Packet Radio Service is designed to provide packet data services at speeds higher than those available with standard circuit switched data services. The GGSN provides a connection for the UTRAN to a packet based network . The packet based network may be the Internet a private data network or some other suitable packet based network. The primary function of the GGSN is to provide the UEs with packet based network connectivity. Data packets may be transferred between the GGSN and the UEs through the SGSN which performs primarily the same functions in the packet based domain as the MSC performs in the circuit switched domain.

An air interface for UMTS may utilize a spread spectrum Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access DS CDMA system. The spread spectrum DS CDMA spreads user data through multiplication by a sequence of pseudorandom bits called chips. The wideband W CDMA air interface for UMTS is based on such direct sequence spread spectrum technology and additionally calls for a frequency division duplexing FDD . FDD uses a different carrier frequency for the UL and DL between a Node B and a UE . Another air interface for UMTS that utilizes DS CDMA and uses time division duplexing TDD is the TD SCDMA air interface. Those skilled in the art will recognize that although various examples described herein may refer to a W CDMA air interface the underlying principles may be equally applicable to a TD SCDMA air interface.

An HSPA air interface includes a series of enhancements to the 3G W CDMA air interface facilitating greater throughput and reduced latency. Among other modifications over prior releases HSPA utilizes hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ shared channel transmission and adaptive modulation and coding. The standards that define HSPA include HSDPA high speed downlink packet access and HSUPA high speed uplink packet access also referred to as enhanced uplink or EUL . HSDPA utilizes as its transport channel the high speed downlink shared channel HS DSCH . The HS DSCH is implemented by three physical channels the high speed physical downlink shared channel HS PDSCH the high speed shared control channel HS SCCH and the high speed dedicated physical control channel HS DPCCH .

Among these physical channels the HS DPCCH carries the HARQ ACK NACK signaling on the uplink to indicate whether a corresponding packet transmission was decoded successfully. That is with respect to the downlink the UE provides feedback to the node B over the HS DPCCH to indicate whether it correctly decoded a packet on the downlink.

HS DPCCH further includes feedback signaling from the UE to assist the node B in taking the right decision in terms of modulation and coding scheme and precoding weight selection this feedback signaling including the CQI and PCI.

 HSPA Evolved or HSPA is an evolution of the HSPA standard that includes MIMO and 64 QAM enabling increased throughput and higher performance. That is in an aspect of the disclosure the node B and or the UE may have multiple antennas supporting MIMO technology. The use of MIMO technology enables the node B to exploit the spatial domain to support spatial multiplexing beamforming and transmit diversity.

Multiple Input Multiple Output MIMO is a term generally used to refer to multi antenna technology that is multiple transmit antennas multiple inputs to the channel and multiple receive antennas multiple outputs from the channel . MIMO systems generally enhance data transmission performance enabling diversity gains to reduce multipath fading and increase transmission quality and spatial multiplexing gains to increase data throughput.

Spatial multiplexing may be used to transmit different streams of data simultaneously on the same frequency. The data steams may be transmitted to a single UE to increase the data rate or to multiple UEs to increase the overall system capacity. This is achieved by spatially precoding each data stream and then transmitting each spatially precoded stream through a different transmit antenna on the downlink. The spatially precoded data streams arrive at the UE s with different spatial signatures which enables each of the UE s to recover the one or more the data streams destined for that UE . On the uplink each UE may transmit one or more spatially precoded data streams which enables the node B to identify the source of each spatially precoded data stream.

Spatial multiplexing may be used when channel conditions are good. When channel conditions are less favorable beamforming may be used to focus the transmission energy in one or more directions or to improve transmission based on characteristics of the channel. This may be achieved by spatially precoding a data stream for transmission through multiple antennas. To achieve good coverage at the edges of the cell a single stream beamforming transmission may be used in combination with transmit diversity.

Generally for MIMO systems utilizing n transmit antennas n transport blocks may be transmitted simultaneously over the same carrier utilizing the same channelization code. Note that the different transport blocks sent over the n transmit antennas may have the same or different modulation and coding schemes from one another.

On the other hand Single Input Multiple Output SIMO generally refers to a system utilizing a single transmit antenna a single input to the channel and multiple receive antennas multiple outputs from the channel . Thus in a SIMO system a single transport block is sent over the respective carrier.

Referring to an access network in a UTRAN architecture is illustrated. The multiple access wireless communication system includes multiple cellular regions cells including cells and each of which may include one or more sectors. The multiple sectors can be formed by groups of antennas with each antenna responsible for communication with UEs in a portion of the cell. For example in cell antenna groups and may each correspond to a different sector. In cell antenna groups and each correspond to a different sector. In cell antenna groups and each correspond to a different sector. The cells and may include several wireless communication devices e.g. UEs which may be in communication with one or more sectors of each cell or . For example UEs and may be in communication with Node B UEs and may be in communication with Node B and UEs and can be in communication with Node B . Here each Node B is configured to provide an access point to a CN see for all the UEs in the respective cells and . The UEs of may be examples of the UE of . In this respect the UEs of may include the reachability component the modem component the transmission component the interface module the one or more applications and the operating system module described above.

As the UE moves from the illustrated location in cell into cell a serving cell change SCC or handover may occur in which communication with the UE transitions from the cell which may be referred to as the source cell to cell which may be referred to as the target cell. Management of the handover procedure may take place at the UE at the Node Bs corresponding to the respective cells at a radio network controller see or at another suitable node in the wireless network. For example during a call with the source cell or at any other time the UE may monitor various parameters of the source cell as well as various parameters of neighboring cells such as cells and . Further depending on the quality of these parameters the UE may maintain communication with one or more of the neighboring cells. During this time the UE may maintain an Active Set that is a list of cells that the UE is simultaneously connected to i.e. the UTRA cells that are currently assigning a downlink dedicated physical channel DPCH or fractional downlink dedicated physical channel F DPCH to the UE may constitute the Active Set .

The modulation and multiple access scheme employed by the access network may vary depending on the particular telecommunications standard being deployed. By way of example the standard may include Evolution Data Optimized EV DO or Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB . EV DO and UMB are air interface standards promulgated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 as part of the CDMA2000 family of standards and employs CDMA to provide broadband Internet access to mobile stations. The standard may alternately be Universal Terrestrial Radio Access UTRA employing Wideband CDMA W CDMA and other variants of CDMA such as TD SCDMA Global System for Mobile Communications GSM employing TDMA and Evolved UTRA E UTRA Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB IEEE 802.11 Wi Fi IEEE 802.16 WiMAX IEEE 802.20 and Flash OFDM employing OFDMA. UTRA E UTRA UMTS LTE LTE Advanced and GSM are described in documents from the 3GPP organization. CDMA2000 and UMB are described in documents from the 3GPP2 organization. The actual wireless communication standard and the multiple access technology employed will depend on the specific application and the overall design constraints imposed on the system.

The radio protocol architecture may take on various forms depending on the particular application. An example for an HSPA system will now be presented with reference to .

Referring to example radio protocol architecture relates to the user plane and the control plane of a UE or node B base station. For example architecture may be included in a UE such as the UE . In this respect the architecture may be used in a UE that supports determining one or more channel metrics identifying a change in a reachability state based at least in part on one or more channel metrics and adjusting a transmission of connectivity signals to a server from an application where the adjusting may be based at least in part on an indication of the change in the reachability state provided to the application via an interface in communication with a modem in the UE. The radio protocol architecture for the UE and node B is shown with three layers Layer 1 Layer 2 and Layer 3 . Layer 1 is the lowest layer and implements various physical layer signal processing functions. As such Layer 1 includes the physical layer . Layer 2 L2 layer is above the physical layer and is responsible for the link between the UE and node B over the physical layer . Layer 3 L3 layer includes a radio resource control RRC sublayer . The RRC sublayer handles the control plane signaling of Layer 3 between the UE and the UTRAN.

In the user plane the L2 layer includes a media access control MAC sublayer a radio link control RLC sublayer and a packet data convergence protocol PDCP sublayer which are terminated at the node B on the network side. Although not shown the UE may have several upper layers above the L2 layer including a network layer e.g. IP layer that is terminated at a PDN gateway on the network side and an application layer that is terminated at the other end of the connection e.g. far end UE server etc. .

The PDCP sublayer provides multiplexing between different radio bearers and logical channels. The PDCP sublayer also provides header compression for upper layer data packets to reduce radio transmission overhead security by ciphering the data packets and handover support for UEs between node Bs. The RLC sublayer provides segmentation and reassembly of upper layer data packets retransmission of lost data packets and reordering of data packets to compensate for out of order reception due to hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ . The MAC sublayer provides multiplexing between logical and transport channels. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for allocating the various radio resources e.g. resource blocks in one cell among the UEs. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for HARQ operations.

At the UE a receiver receives the downlink transmission through an antenna and processes the transmission to recover the information modulated onto the carrier. The infatuation recovered by the receiver is provided to a receive frame processor which parses each frame and provides information from the frames to a channel processor and the data control and reference signals to a receive processor . The receive processor then performs the inverse of the processing performed by the transmit processor in the Node B . More specifically the receive processor descrambles and despreads the symbols and then determines the most likely signal constellation points transmitted by the Node B based on the modulation scheme. These soft decisions may be based on channel estimates computed by the channel processor . The soft decisions are then decoded and deinterleaved to recover the data control and reference signals. The CRC codes are then checked to determine whether the frames were successfully decoded. The data carried by the successfully decoded frames will then be provided to a data sink which represents applications running in the UE and or various user interfaces e.g. display . Control signals carried by successfully decoded frames will be provided to a controller processor . When frames are unsuccessfully decoded by the receiver processor the controller processor may also use an acknowledgement ACK and or negative acknowledgement NACK protocol to support retransmission requests for those frames. In one aspect controller processor may also include reachability component . In other aspects at least a portion of the functions or features described above with respect to the reachability component may be implemented in other modules processors and or components of the UE . Moreover although not shown the UE may include a modem such as the modem component . In one example a modem may be implemented in the UE as part of the receiver and or the transmitter .

In the uplink data from a data source and control signals from the controller processor are provided to a transmit processor . The data source may represent applications running in the UE and various user interfaces e.g. keyboard . Similar to the functionality described in connection with the downlink transmission by the Node B the transmit processor provides various signal processing functions including CRC codes coding and interleaving to facilitate FEC mapping to signal constellations spreading with OVSFs and scrambling to produce a series of symbols. Channel estimates derived by the channel processor from a reference signal transmitted by the Node B or from feedback contained in the midamble transmitted by the Node B may be used to select the appropriate coding modulation spreading and or scrambling schemes. The symbols produced by the transmit processor will be provided to a transmit frame processor to create a frame structure. The transmit frame processor creates this frame structure by multiplexing the symbols with information from the controller processor resulting in a series of frames. The frames are then provided to a transmitter which provides various signal conditioning functions including amplification filtering and modulating the frames onto a carrier for uplink transmission over the wireless medium through the antenna .

The uplink transmission is processed at the Node B in a manner similar to that described in connection with the receiver function at the UE . A receiver receives the uplink transmission through the antenna and processes the transmission to recover the information modulated onto the carrier. The information recovered by the receiver is provided to a receive frame processor which parses each frame and provides information from the frames to the channel processor and the data control and reference signals to a receive processor . The receive processor performs the inverse of the processing performed by the transmit processor in the UE . The data and control signals carried by the successfully decoded frames may then be provided to a data sink and the controller processor respectively. If some of the frames were unsuccessfully decoded by the receive processor the controller processor may also use an acknowledgement ACK and or negative acknowledgement NACK protocol to support retransmission requests for those frames.

The controller processors and may be used to direct the operation at the Node B and the UE respectively. For example the controller processors and may provide various functions including timing peripheral interfaces voltage regulation power management and other control functions. The computer readable media of memories and may store data and software for the Node B and the UE respectively. A scheduler processor at the Node B may be used to allocate resources to the UEs and schedule downlink and or uplink transmissions for the UEs.
