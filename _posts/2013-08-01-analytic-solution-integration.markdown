title: Analytic solution integration
abstract: Embodiments relate analytic solution integration. According to an aspect, a method for analytic solution integration includes establishing an engine abstraction layer configured to interface with a plurality of analytic engines associated with a plurality of models. A services layer is interfaced with the engine abstraction layer to provide a communication interface to invoke the analytic engines associated with the models. A user interface is provided to the services layer. The user interface is configured to define an analytic solution as an executable sequence of one or more of the models.
