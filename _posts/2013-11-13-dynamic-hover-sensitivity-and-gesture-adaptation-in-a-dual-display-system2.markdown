This disclosure relates generally information handling systems and more particularly relates to touch screen sensitivity in a dual display information handling system.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system. An information handling system generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as clinical healthcare data storage and distribution financial transaction processing procurement stocking and delivery tracking provision of data services and software airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems. Additionally information handling systems may have two or more display platforms with one or more display screens for output of images and for input such as by touch screen operation or active pen input.

The following description in combination with the Figures is provided to assist in understanding the teachings disclosed herein. The following discussion will focus on specific implementations and embodiments of the teachings. This focus is provided to assist in describing the teachings and should not be interpreted as a limitation on the scope or applicability of the teachings. However other teachings can certainly be used in this application. The teachings can also be used in other applications and with several different types of architectures such as distributed computing architectures client server architectures or middleware server architectures and associated resources.

Multiple display platform information handling systems may be configurable in a plurality of orientations for utilization of and interaction with the information handling system. Hereinafter the terms dual display screen information handling system or dual display information handling systems or dual display platform information handling system each may refer to devices with a single display screen such as a flexible display that is layered over or mounted on all or part of two or more display platforms or each may refer to devices with two or more fully integrated display screens or each may refer to devices with a plurality of separate display screens that are modularly connectable to the information handling system or to one another. The terms screen or display screen may also refer to a portion of a single display screen such as a flexible display screen with a plurality of portions or to an individual display screen. Screens or display screens may herein refer to portions of a display screen and may be mounted on or integrated into one or more display platforms. It is understood that while two display platforms are disclosed in several embodiments herein embodiments including a plurality of display platforms including three or more display platforms in hinged relationship is also contemplated for the systems and methods disclosed herein. One of ordinary skill would understand implementing the systems and method embodiments discussed herein for these additional embodiments.

More specifically system represents a mobile user client device such as a dual screen mobile tablet computer. System has a network interface device such as for a wireless cellular or mobile networks CDMA TDMA etc. WIFI WLAN LAN or similar network connection enabling a user to communicate via a wired or wireless communications network such as the Internet. System may be configured with conventional web browser software. The web browser may include for example Microsoft Corporation s Internet Explorer web browser software Firefox or similar such browsers to allow the user to interact with websites via the wireless communications network .

System may include several sets of instructions to be run by CPU and any embedded controllers on system . One such set of instructions includes an operating system with operating system interface. Example operating systems can include those used with typical mobile computing devices such as Windows Phone mobile OS from Microsoft Corporation and Android OS from Google Inc. for example Key Lime Pie v. 5.x. Additional sets of instructions in the form of multiple software applications may be run by system . These software applications may enable multiple uses of the dual display information handling system as set forth in more detail below.

System includes a first or primary display screen and a second display screen . Each display screen has a display driver operated by one or more graphics processing units GPUs such as those that are part of the chipset . Each display screen also has an associated touch controller to accept touch input on the touch interface of each display screen. It is contemplated that one touch controller may accept touch input from display screens and or as shown in the current embodiment two touch controllers and may operate each display screen respectively. In the current embodiment the first touch controller is associated with the first display screen . The second touch controller is associated with the second display screen .

The first display screen and the second display screen may also be controlled by the embedded controller of chipset . For example the power to the first display screen and the second display screen is controlled by an embedded controller in the processor chipset s which manages a battery management unit BMU as part of a power management unit PMU in the BIOS firmware of the main CPU processor chipset s . These controls form a part of the power operating system. The PMU and BMU control power provision to the display screens and other components of the dual display information handling system. For example a hover touch detection sensitivity of the display screens may be increased or decreased based upon a detection power level to the display screens.

A display mode selector in connection with a power management application as described in more detail below determines what power levels to deploy via the embedded controller based upon orientation of the two display screens and as well as the software applications currently running and active. Determining which applications are running determines a working software application context. Alternatively the power mode selector may operate on a controller separate from the main CPU chipset s . Additionally the power management application may receive state of usage activity input from device state sensors.

System of the current embodiment has a system sensor module . Various orientation sensors are included in this module to assist with determining the relative orientation of the dual display information handling system. Subcategories of orientation sensors include motion sensors image sensors and sound sensors . Other orientation sensors are contemplated as well including state of usage activity sensors as discussed in more detail below with . Sensor system module is a sensor hub or an accumulator device that collects raw data from connected orientation sensors and organizes and processes data received from the connected sensors. The sensor hub also processes raw sensor data to groom the raw sensor data into a useable form of positional analysis for the dual display information handling system and its display screens. Such a sensor hub may be an independent microcontroller such as the STMicro Sensor Fusion MCU as well as other microcontroller processing systems known to persons of ordinary skill. Alternatively it is contemplated that the sensor and fusion hub may be integrated into a core processing chipset such as CPU systems for mobile devices as available from Intel corporation or may utilize ARM Core processors that serve as single or multiple core processors in alternative chipset systems. The sensor hub may communicate with the sensors and the main CPU processor chipset via a bus connection such as an Inter Integrated Circuit I2C bus or other suitable type of multi master bus connection.

The sensor data from the sensor hub is then further groomed by the power management application and the display mode selector . A relative orientation of the dual display information handling system in space the orientation of the two display screens with respect to one another consideration of state of usage activity data and working software application context are determined by the power management application and the display mode selector and CPU and embedded controller . This relative orientation data of the dual display information handling system the state of usage activity data and the working software application context are used by a power management application and display mode selector to determine power levels to be applied to the display screens.

Typically system may also include microphones and speakers for audio input and output not shown . The microphones and speakers are connected through an HDA Codec such as the Realtek ALC 5642 or similar such codec. Data from the microphones may serve motion sensing using a Doppler Effect detection of display screen locations. This is discussed further below.

The power management application and display mode selector receive data from the sensor system module that includes an accumulator sensor hub that gathers sets of data from some or all of the orientation sensors shown. The orientation sensor types include motion sensors image sensors sound sensors and other sensors . Some orientation sensors are connected through the sensor hub or accumulator device and system. Other orientation sensors may directly provide data to the dual screen dual display power management system via their own application drivers and data detection systems. For example the camera system and detection of gaze or presence of a user can operate on a different set of drivers and data be groomed by a software application running on the chipset s processors to interpret camera input. This data is then provided to the dual display screen dual display power management system.

Motion sensors may include one or more digital gyroscopes accelerometers and magnetometers. Motion sensors may also include reference point sensors. For example a geomagnetic field sensor may determine position of one or both display screens of the dual screen information handling system and or the overall dual display information handling system device itself. This positional information may provide x axis y axis and z axis positional information of the dual display information handling system relative to magnetic north pole and thereby provide a reference point of the device position. In one embodiment a geomagnetic field sensor in combination with another sensor provides x axis y axis and z axis positional information for each display screen of the dual display information handling system. With this data the system determines the relative position of the two display screens to one another in orientation.

Also a digital gyro and accelerometer may be used to detect motion and changes in position. These sensors may provide a matrix of data. In an example embodiment the azimuth or yaw pitch and roll values of the device are indicated by the raw sensor data. The raw orientation data may be relevant to the dual display power management system as an entire device in one embodiment. In another embodiment determination of azimuth pitch and roll data may be made of individual display screens and in the dual screen power management system . In a further embodiment the two individual display screens are integrably hinged together along one side each display screen. Thus relative positions of each individual display screen and are important input data to determining power levels to be applied to the display screens as described below.

In connection with a reference point such as magnetic north as provided in one embodiment by a geomagnetic field sensor the azimuth can be determined as a degree of rotation around a z axis. Note this is different from hinge azimuth angle discussed further below. In an embodiment the azimuth may be the value of the z axis relative to the device y axis as positive angle values between 0 and 360 . It is understood that a different range of values may be assigned in different embodiments.

Based on a reference point such as provided by a geomagnetic field sensor pitch may be determined as a degree of rotation around the x axis. In an example embodiment the angle values may range from positive 180 to negative 180 relative to the y axis although other value ranges may be assigned instead.

Roll is also based on the reference value for example that established by a geomagnetic sensor. Roll may be considered to be rotation about the y axis and its values may range from positive 90 to negative 90 . Again the value ranges assigned can vary for each of the azimuth pitch and roll as long as a set of values is used to define orientation parameters in three dimensional space.

The matrix of raw sensor data from the geomagnetic field sensor and the gyro and accelerometer sensors may be processed partly by a sensor hub or accumulator to provide orientation data for the dual display information handling system device. The sensor hub performs a fusion of data signals received from either a single sensor or multiple sensor devices. As described above in reference to the sensor hub also processes raw sensor data to groom the raw sensor data into a useable form of positional analysis for the dual display information handling system and its display screens. In the example embodiment the sensor hub is an independent microcontroller such as the STMicro Sensor Fusion MCU.

No more than three orientation sensors are needed. A reference sensor and a motion sensor associated is attached to one display screen to determine its orientation. A second sensor which is either another reference sensor or a motion sensor associated with or attached to the second screen to provide enough information of location or movement of the second display screen relative to the first display screen to determine the overall orientation mode of the dual display information handling system. Algorithmic calculation of the sensor data from the first display screen such as a geomagnetic field reference sensor and an accelerometer motion sensor may be used to determine the orientation of the first display screen according to a geomagnetic field or other reference point. Additional algorithmic calculations of movement data or differences in reference point data from the second display screen are used to determine position or orientation of the second display screen in space relative to the first display screen. The fixed location of the hinge and determination of the position of and relative angle between each of the two display screens also yields positional information on a hinge azimuth angle. The hinge azimuth angle different from the raw azimuth z axis measurement discussed above relates to the orientation of the hinge axis relative to a detected users viewing line or relative to the viewing line most likely to be used by a viewer based on the dual display device s current configuration.

In one example embodiment two digital gyroscopes may be used one for each display screen of the dual display information handling system and a geomagnetic field reference sensor may be used in association with either display screen. In yet another example embodiment two accelerometers may be used in addition to a reference sensor one for each display screen of the dual display information handling system. Some sensor types may be combination sensor devices in certain embodiments as is known in the art. For example a motion sensor may be used that combines the functions of a digital gyroscope and accelerometer to detect motion. Thus one accelerometer and one digital gyroscope or two gyro accelerometer combination devices may be used along with at least one reference sensor to determine the dual display information handling system orientation. Any combination of the above reference sensors and motion sensors may be used in a three sensor embodiment to determine orientation of the display screens e.g. relative angle and the hinge azimuth angle.

It is contemplated that more sensors associated with each of the first and second display screens provide more data permitting increased accuracy in determination the dual display information handling system orientation. This has trade offs however in materials cost space occupancy and power consumption. Use of dual sensor types in each display screen for the dual display device permits two sets of processed orientation data to be developed by the accumulator. With these two sets of data display mode selector of the central processor or the embedded controller may determine changes in movement of each display screen of the dual display device. These movement changes indicate relative position of these two display screens and to one another. This provides information permitting the system to understand the location and movement of each of the two display screens relative to one another as well as their position and movement in space overall. Such additional capability may provide more precise determination by the display mode selector of the intended display mode of the dual display information handling system.

The relative measurements of position in space relative to a reference point may be further processed relative to measurements of position from other sensors. For example azimuth pitch and roll may establish the position in space of one display screen. Then data from one or more sensors on a second display screen such as a gyroscope may indicate a different azimuth pitch and roll for the second display screen. With position of the two display screens and a known hinge point or points the system determines a relative angle between the first display screen and a second display screen. Similarly the system for determining orientation of the dual display device will know the location of a fixed hinge axis and based on positional information of the two display screens in space. Thus the dual display power management system determines the hinge azimuth angle relative to the probable viewing line of a user. The viewing line of a user may also be detected with a camera detection system or other proximity sensor to recognize the location of a user relative to the dual display device.

Other techniques are also contemplated to determine relative position and movement of two display screens integrated into a dual display information handling system. For example Doppler Effect sound sensors may typically include one or more microphones and speakers used in connection with Doppler effect calculations to determine relative position of two display screens in a dual display information handling system. A transmitter and microphone receiver can detect a Doppler shift in sound or ultrasound signal to measure distance or location of the two display screens integrably hinged. In one example the Doppler Effect sensors may operate in the 0 40 kHz range to detect relative location of the hinged dual screens in an open configuration.

Image sensors may include a camera photocell or color sensor. A photocell may detect the open or closed state of a dual display information handling system by determining hinged screens are no longer in a closed position when light is detected by the photocell. Additionally the photocell may detect ambient light levels in determining brightness levels of one or more display screens. A photocell may even be used to indicate when one display screen is oriented face down on a surface such as a table while the other display screen may be actively displaying.

A camera may be used as an image sensor to provide several types of feedback. It may be used as a light sensor similar to a photocell. A camera may also be used to facilitate a reference point for orientation by detecting the presence and location of a user in front of one or more display screen of a dual display information handling system. Location of a user relative to one or both display screens provide a rough user viewing vector that may be used to determine display usage mode by the display mode selector . The camera may be tasked to sense the position of a user around the two screens for example directly in front above below to the right or to the left of the plane of the display screen as well as using facial recognition capability as is known to the art to determine the orientation of the person s face. This information enables the system to correctly orient both displays on the display screens according to a viewing line of sight or viewing vector based on position and orientation of the user.

A camera may also be used with gaze detection to determine which screen in a dual screen information handling system is actively being viewed by a user. Determining which screen between the dual screens is being actively viewed provides additional data for the display mode selector and the dual display power management system application to determine power level implementations that may be appropriate. Eye tracking and gaze technology implementations are available in the art from companies such as Synaptics Inc. and Tobii Technologies. Description of this technology is found at http www.synaptics.com about press press releases tobii and synaptics unveil concept laptop integrates eye tracking and touch press release Jun. 25 2013 . Use of eye tracking and gaze technology in the present disclosure permits control over determination of which display screen is active in a dual display information handling system. Power may be reduced to a non active display screen depending on the application being used and physical orientation of the system.

In addition to motion sensors image sensors and sound sensors other sensors such as a variety of state of usage activity sensors are contemplated. For example touch or hover sensors may detect which screen is actively being used. Proximity sensors may detect the location of a user relative to one or both display screens. Proximity sensors in one or both display screens may detect the position of a user around the two screens for example directly in front above below to the right or to the left of the plane of the display screen and thus infer the viewing vector based on the position of the user or users. A Hall Effect sensor may detect when a magnet of certain polarity and strength is in proximity to the sensor. It is used to detect the closed position of a device with two sides. For example a Hall Effect sensor may determine when two integrably hinged display screens are closed onto one another so that a magnet in one screen triggers a Hall Effect sensor in the second screen. Alternatively a different Hall Effect sensor may determine if the hinged display screens are open to an orientation of 360 so that the back sides of the display screens are in proximity such that a magnet located with one display screen triggers the Hall Effect sensor of the other.

Hall Effect magnets and magnetic sensors may be deployed as a type of motion sensor although it is also a position or state sensor. It is known in the art that a relative angle between a magnetic field source of known polarity and strength may be determined by strength and change to a magnetization vector detected by magneto resistive detectors of a Hall Effect sensor. Thus motion and relative angle may also be detected by the Hall Effect sensors. Other detectors are also contemplated such as a hinge angle detector that may be mechanical electromechanical or another detecting method to determine how far the hinge between the two display screens has been opened. Such detectors are known in the art.

The context selection module determines what software applications are operating on the dual screen information handling system. Categories of working software application contexts such as running office applications for database creation and word processing note taking accessing internet data applications gaming video playback entertainment video and voice communications email and other electronic communication websurfing music mobile applications and others are grouped according to similarities in usage on a dual screen information handling system. Websurfing and use of some types of mobile applications may have similar usage on a dual screen device. The working software application context data is provided to the display mode selection module of the power management application along with sensor data for orientation and state of usage activity data for determination of a usage mode and power management strategy for the dual screen device.

Displays and represent combined input output devices for dual display information handling system such as touch screen displays that operate to display the information provided by respective housings and . As such housings and also operate to receive inputs to direct the activities of dual display information handling system such as by receiving touch based inputs from respective displays and . For example dual display information handling system can include one or more instantiations of a touch screen device enabled operating system as known in the art such that one or more of displays and can display a keyboard interface and receive touch based keyboard inputs. In a particular embodiment displays and represent gesture enabled display devices that are equipped to detect the motion of a touch over the surface to the displays. In another embodiment displays and represent multi touch enabled display devices that are equipped to detect two or more simultaneous touch contacts on the surface of the displays. In yet another embodiment described below displays and represent hover sensitive display devices that are equipped not only to detect a touch to the surface of the displays but also to detect the presence of a touch device that is hovering in proximity over the surface of the displays. The skilled artisan will recognize that displays and are known in the art and include other features and functions and that the teachings of the present disclosure may incorporate such features and functions. For example the tool providing the touch or hover over displays and can include a pen based touch tool a finger or other human interface or another tool as needed or desired.

Dual display information handling system operates to receive input information from orientation sensors and directional sensors and cameras and and gyroscopic sensors and . Orientation sensors and represent sensors that operate to determine an orientation in space of respective housings and based upon a three dimensional coordinate grid established by each orientation sensor and a sensed input to each dimension of the orientation sensors. For example orientation sensor can determine that housing is oriented horizontally vertically with a bottom parallel to the ground vertically with a side parallel to the ground or in an intermediate orientation.

Direction sensors and represent sensors that operate to determine an orientation with respect to magnetic north of a major axis to respective housings and . For example where housing is oriented horizontally direction sensor can determine a compass heading of a line oriented along a side of the housing.

Cameras and represent video input devices that are configured to take photographic or video images and to detect the motion or presence of a pointing device in proximity with the respective housings and . In a particular embodiment one or more of cameras and are further configured to detect the direction of a glance of a user of dual display information handling system . For example camera can distinguish between a case where a user is looking at the top left corner of housing and another case where the user is looking at the bottom right corner of the housing. In this embodiment one or more of cameras and is further configured to follow the glance of the user as it moves across the respective housing or .

Gyroscopic sensors and represent sensors that operate to detect a rotational motion of respective housings and and a rate of the rotational motion. In a particular embodiment the functions of gyroscopic sensor are provided not by a separate sensor device in housing but the functions are provided by orientation sensor . Similarly the functions of gyroscopic sensor can be provided by orientation sensor .

Hinge mechanism represents a coupling device that connects housing to housing . As such hinge mechanism can include a hinge that joins an edge of housing to an edge of housing . Here hinge mechanism operates to permit housing to swing to any angle between 0 and 360 degrees of arc with respect to housing . illustrates dual display information handling system in an orientation where housing is swung to a 0 degree angle with respect to housing . Here dual display information handling system is in a state that is normally associated as a closed state. Returning to dual display information handling system is here illustrated in an orientation where housing is swung to a 180 degree angle with respect to housing . illustrate various different orientations as described further below. In a particular embodiment not illustrated hinge mechanism further permits housing to rotate with respect to housing such that a back side of housing is presented on the same side of dual display information handling system as the front side of housing . In another embodiment not illustrated hinge mechanism provides for housing to be detachable from housing such as by a magnetic coupling between the housings that can be pulled apart.

Dual display information handling system operates such that inputs from one or more of orientation sensor directional sensor camera and gyroscopic sensor are evaluated in conjunction with inputs from one or more of orientation sensor directional sensor camera and gyroscopic sensor to determine the orientation of housing with respect to housing . For example orientation sensors and can be arranged to have a common orientation with respect to respective housings and such that different sensed orientations between orientation sensor and orientation sensor can be correlated to the relative orientations of the housings. In another example one or more of cameras and can correlate a portion of the field of view that is inhabited by an opposite housing or to determine the relative orientations. In a particular embodiment orientations of greater than 180 degrees can be determined by the presence of one or more cameras on backsides of housings or . The skilled artisan will recognize that other sensors than the disclosed orientation sensors direction sensors cameras and gyroscopic sensors can be utilized to provide an indication of a relative orientation between housings and . For example a Hall Effect sensor in one housing can be combined with a magnet with a known orientation in the other housing to provide an indication of the relative orientations. Other examples of sensors that can be used to provide an indication of the relative orientations between housings and can include camera based imaging sensors microphone based Doppler location sensors or other sensors as needed or desired. Also note that more or less of each type of sensor can be employed on housings and as needed or desired to perform the functions as described herein.

In media modes A and B dual display information handling system determines that housing is swung to substantially 360 degrees with respect to housing . Thus for example housing can display a media application to present video content to a user that is facing housing . In a particular embodiment dual display information handling system determines that a user is facing one of housings or and activates the determined housing. For example cameras can determine which of housings and a user is facing and can initiate one of media modes A or B in response. As such if the user is facing housing then dual display information handling system is operated in media mode A and if the user if facing housing then the dual display information handling system is operated in media mode B. In another embodiment dual display information handling system determines that users are facing both of housings or and activates a dual media mode not illustrated .

In presentation mode D dual display information handling system determines that housing is oriented substantially horizontally and that housing is swung to greater than 270 degrees with respect to housing . As such display can be determined to be facing downward for example as when dual display information handling system is placed upon a flat surface such as a table or a desk. Here dual display information handling system can be operated similarly to media mode B and housing can be used to display a media application to present video content to a user that is facing housing . In this way housing acts as a base to hold up housing . The skilled artisan will recognize that a similar presentation mode can be achieved that uses housing as the base and uses housing for display purposes. In a particular embodiment camera provides an automatic light sensing ALS function to determine that display is facing downward such as by detecting a reduced light level and dual display information handling system disables display to save power.

In dual presentation mode D dual display information handling system determines that housings and are oriented substantially symmetrically with respect to the ground and that housing is swung to greater than 270 degrees with respect to housing the dual display information handling system being oriented in a tent like configuration. Here dual display information handling system can be operated similarly to presentation mode C and housing can be used to display a media application to present video content to a user that is facing housing . In this way housing acts as a prop for housing . In a particular embodiment dual display information handling system determines that a user is facing one of housings or and activates the determined housing. For example cameras can determine which of housings and a user is facing and can initiate the determined housing in response. As such if the user if facing housing then housing is activated and if the user is facing housing housing is activated. In another embodiment dual display information handling system determines that users are facing both of housings or and both housings are activated.

In tablet modes B dual display information handling system determines that housing is swung to substantially 360 degrees with respect to housing . As such dual display information handling system can be operated as a tablet device in tablet modes B. Thus for example housing can display a tablet application to a user that is facing housing . In a particular embodiment dual display information handling system determines that a user is facing one of housings or and activates the determined housing. For example cameras can determine which of housings and a user is facing and can initiate one of tablet modes B in response. As such if the user is facing housing then dual display information handling system is operated in tablet mode B and if the user if facing housing then the dual display information handling system is operated in tablet mode not shown . In another embodiment dual display information handling system determines that users are facing both of housings or and activates a dual tablet mode not illustrated .

A low power sense state is illustrated where touch device is detected in proximity to front panel by sensing variations in field lines between x axis sense lines and y axis sense lines . In low power sense state field lines are loosely grouped together and the touch screen is capable of less precise detection of the location of touch device above front panel . As such in low power sense state touch device is detected as being located less precisely above x axis sense lines and and y axis sense lines and . The skilled artisan will recognize that high power sense state and low power sense state are illustrative of multiple sense states that may be available with a particular touch screen and that a trade off exists between the power level consumed at a particular sense power level and the resolution that is achievable at that sense power level. Further the skilled artisan will recognize that in a lower power sense state touch device can be detected at a further distance from front panel and that in a higher power sense state the touch device will need to be closer to the front panel in order to be detected. In a particular embodiment the different power sense states are provided by employing a pulse width modulation scheme and that a longer duty cycle will correlate to a higher power sense state while a shorter duty cycle will correlate to a lower power sense state.

In another example not illustrated dual display information handling system can detect that it is oriented substantially horizontally and that housing is swung to 180 degrees with respect to housing and can further detect that the dual display information handling system is running a spreadsheet program. From this dual display information handling system can determine that the dual display information handling system is configured in a tablet configuration and the dual display information handling system can select a high sensitivity state because a common gesture with touch device while a user is running a spreadsheet program is a selection of a cell in the spreadsheet and higher resolution is needed to precisely detect the selected cell.

In a particular embodiment dual display information handling system operates to dynamically change the power sense state while the dual display information handling system is in a particular usage mode. For example where dual display information handling system is determined to be in the book usage mode and the low sensitivity state can be selected in preparation for gestures with touch device for turning the page. However when touch device is detected to be hovering over a single spot dual display information handling system can select a high sensitivity state because another common gesture with the touch device while a user is running a book reader program is to select a word on the page and higher resolution is needed to precisely locate the word. In a particular embodiment other sensors can be used to confirm the gestures performed by touch device . For example a camera in one of housings or can provide video information about the gestures or an array of microphones can provide Doppler location information about the gestures. Note that based upon the determined usage mode dual display information handling system can selectively change the power sense state for one the other or both of touch screens and as needed or desired. Further note that the disclosed dynamic selection of power sense states based upon a usage mode of a device is not limited to dual display information handling systems but can similarly be applied to single display devices and multiple display devices as needed or desired.

In a particular embodiment a dual display information handling system similar to dual display information handling system implements a policy table to manage the determination of poser sense states as illustrated in Table 1. Here an orientation for a dual display information handling system is determined based upon an orientation of a primary housing such as being substantially horizontal or substantially vertical and further based on an angle between the primary housing and the secondary housing such as being in a particular range of angles. Note that the orientations and angles provided in a policy table can be defined as needed or desired. In a particular embodiment where a primary housing is determined to be oriented between a 0 degree angle with the ground and a 45 degree angle with the ground the dual display information handling system can be determined to be oriented substantially horizontally and where the primary housing is determined to be oriented between a 45 degree angle with the ground and a 90 degree angle with the ground the dual display information handling system can be determined to be oriented substantially vertically. Then based on a determination of the application or program that is running on the dual display information handling system a particular usage mode can be determined and a power sense state for the touch screens can be selected. The skilled artisan will understand that the orientations angle ranges modes applications and sense states shown in Table 1 are examples and that other orientations angle ranges modes applications and sense states can be defined as needed or desired.

Based upon the usage mode a policy is applied to select a default power sense state for the touch screens of the dual display information handling system in block . For example the dual display information handling system can be determined to be in a book mode and so the dual display information handling system can select a low sensitivity state to detect hover gestures with less resolution and at a higher distance from the surface of the housings.

A gesture is detected in block . A decision is made as to whether or not the gesture is consistent with the default power sense state in decision block . Here continuing the example above where the dual display information handling system is in a book mode the gesture can be a sweeping gesture that is consistent with the default low power state or the gesture can be a hover gesture that indicates that a higher power state is desired. If the gesture is consistent with the default sense state the YES branch of decision block is taken the gesture is processed using the default sense state in block and the method returns to block to await detection of another gesture. If the gesture is not consistent with the default sense state the NO branch of decision block is taken an alternate sense state for the housings is set in block the gesture is processed using the alternate sense state in block and the method returns to block where the default sense state is reset.
