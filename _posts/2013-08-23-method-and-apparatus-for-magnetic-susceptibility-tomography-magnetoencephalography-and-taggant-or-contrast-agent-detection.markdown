This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 693 044 filed Aug. 24 2013 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The invention was made with support of the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute grants 1R21EB016241 01A1 1U54CA151662 01 and 5R24HD065703 03. The government has certina rights in the invention.

The present document relates to nondestructive imaging of magnetically susceptible materials and biologically generated magnetic fields. The magnetic susceptibility imaging described relates to noninvasive functional neuroimaging imaging of magnetic nanoparticles Magnetic Susceptibility Tomography MST and Magnetoencephalography MEG magnetically susceptible taggant technologies and other applications that require measurement of and detection of minute changes in magnetic susceptibility.

Measurement and mapping of human brain neural activity is of interest in medicine neuroscience and psychology. Prior techniques of noninvasively measuring and mapping neural activity in the brain such as electroencephalography EEG and magnetoencephalography MEG have been used both as research tools and for clinical diagnosis. Indirect methods of imaging neural activity measure tissue metabolism with positron emission tomography PET and single photon emission computed tomography SPECT or via the hemodynamic response measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and functional near infrared spectroscopy fNIRS neuroimaging.

A direct noninvasive approach to measuring neuronal activity is with electroencephalography EEG however it can be difficult to interpret the waveforms of signal versus time plotted at various electrode locations on a subject s skull that are produced by traditional electroencephalographs. Electroencephalography uses electrodes placed in contact with the scalp to detect electric voltages generated by large groups of firing neurons within the brain and is of use in diagnosis of epilepsy and other disorders of the brain.

Another noninvasive approach to measuring neuronal activity is magnetoencephalography MEG that measures magnetic fields produced by the brain. Commercial magnetoencephalography machines that sense and map the minute magnetic fields associated with the electric voltages and currents generated by large groups of firing neurons within the brain and construct a three dimensional map of detected neural activity are available from companies such as Elekta AB Stockholm Sweden. In addition to magnetoencephalographic magnetic fields biomagnetic fields also include magnetic fields generated by muscular activity including muscular activity of the heart and intestines.

The dominant functional neuroimaging modality today is fMRI using blood oxygen level dependent BOLD contrast to reconstruct three dimensional movies of brain activity.

fNIRS functional Near Infrared Spectrometry is an alternative method of measuring hemodynamic responses near the surface of the brain and which does not require the intense magnetic field and massive immobile magnets of fMRI. Because fNIRS relies on reconstruction of scatterers and absorbers of infrared light penetrating the brain fNIRS does not well resolve activity in deep structures.

The hemodynamic response measured by fNIRS and fMRI is a localized change in blood flow blood volume and blood oxygenation that is coupled to neural activity by the activity of astrocytes neurotransmitter signaling and metabolites in the tissue. This neurovascular coupling involves a complex interplay of neuron activity and spatiotemporal variations in metabolism blood flow and blood oxygen level. These processes are functionally connected in neurovascular units of the brain which are composed of integrated networks of neurons astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells.

Combined multimodal measurement of neural and hemodynamic responses is preferred for studies of central nervous system CNS diseases and investigations where neurovascular coupling is questioned Impaired neurovascular coupling is implicated in stroke hypertension epilepsy brain tumors Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases and is the subject of intense biomedical research on brain dynamics. The available noninvasive neuroimaging instruments measure only one physiological process i.e. neural metabolic or hemodynamic. Studies on neurovascular coupling currently require simultaneous operation of two neuroimaging modalities and typically suffer from mismatched resolution mismatched data rates and noise interference between the measurement modalities e.g. combined fMRI and EEG.

Noninvasive imaging of magnetic nanoparticles is another related health related field of interest. The magnetic properties of iron core nanoparticles have opened new avenues of targeted cancer therapy where they are used to selectively heat and kill tumor cells. Effective technology for noninvasive in vivo detection and location of magnetic nanoparticles is essential to the development and implementation of this targeted cancer therapy.

Hyperthermia treatment of cancerous tumors can effectively cause cancer cell death through mechanisms of protein denaturation and or rupture of the cellular membrane. The destroyed cancer cells are then removed by macrophages causing the tumor to shrink.

It is critically important in hyperthermia therapy to specifically target the cancer cells with the heat deposition and to minimize harm to healthy and or critical tissues. Targeted hyperthermia therapy typically relies on localizing an energy absorbing agent within the tumor prior to application of energy to the region. A variety of specific nanoparticles have been designed for this purpose. One approach is to coat the nanoparticles with gold and then to deposit energy with laser light.

Another approach is to use nanoparticles having an iron or iron oxide component. In embodiments the iron or iron oxide component may be a core or shell surrounding a core of another material. The iron or iron oxide component gives these nanoparticles a high level of magnetic susceptibility. Since nanoparticles having such an iron or iron oxide component typically have other materials surrounding the iron or iron oxide component such as biocompatible coatings and or tissue binding antibodies or agents these nanoparticles are referred to herein as iron core nanoparticles. Alternating magnetic fields are then used to selectively heat the magnetic nanoparticles in the tumor.

The exteriors of nanoparticles can also be modified to contain cancer binding molecules that can selectively bind cancer cells and thereby deliver nanoparticles to cancerous cells. Several cancer specific antibodies that can be conjugated to nanoparticles have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration FDA and are clinically used to treat tumors. Cancer types that can be targeted in this way currently include colorectal non small cell lung breast leukemia gastrointestinal myeloma lymphoma kidney and liver. Nanoparticles have also been engineered to target atherosclerotic plaques which are of importance in heart disease and stroke and Alzheimer s plaques. Iron core nanoparticles can be used to target an increasingly wide range of diseases. These targeting mechanisms impart enhanced magnetic susceptibility to the targeted tumor region and can be used both for treatment and for tumor localization and identification.

The magnetic susceptibility property of iron core nanoparticles can also be used in conjunction with bound disease targeting molecules such as antibodies for the detection of the diseased tissue in disease diagnostics. For example the increased magnetic susceptibility of tissue tagged with nanoparticles will alter the contrast of images taken with MRI or dyes delivered by nanoparticles could be used to obtain enhanced contrast with NIRS. Imaging of iron core nanoparticle locations is also important when using targeted chemotherapy and targeted hyperthermia treatments because damage to vital tissues and structures could result if the particles are in the wrong location when activated with the external energy.

Another related field is labeling and reading of labels of materials and manufactured parts for the purposes of authentication track and trace and supply chain management.

The problem of counterfeit electronic parts is a major problem in the Department of Defense DOD supply chain as well as commercial aviation and drug supplies.

A magnetic susceptibility tomographic device has sensitive magnetic sensors about a measurement volume and AC bias coils for providing magnetic fields within the volume. Sensing circuitry reads the sensors and a processor executes magnetic susceptibility tomography MST routines from memory to divide the measurement volume into voxels to determine differences between applied and measured field strengths of magnetic fields at each voxel and thereby determines magnetic susceptibility of each voxel and to construct tomographic images representative of magnetic susceptibility as MST images. Embodiments with SQUID and fluxgate sensors are described. Applications to direct measurement of tissue magnetic susceptibility and to locating and quantifying tagged magnetic nanoparticles are disclosed including antibody tagged nanoparticles for use in cancer diagnosis and treatments.

In an embodiment an apparatus for obtaining magnetic susceptibility data includes multiple sensitive magnetic sensors disposed about a measurement volume and adapted to measure magnetic fields of the measurement volume multiple bias coils disposed about the measurement volume and adapted for providing magnetic fields within the measurement volume driving circuitry coupled to the bias coils and adapted to driving the bias coils with alternating current sensing circuitry coupled to read the sensitive magnetic sensors digitization circuitry adapted to digitize readings of the sensitive magnetic sensors a processor adapted to receive information from the digitization circuitry magnetic susceptibility tomography MST routines in memory of the processor the MST routines comprising machine readable instructions for directing the processor to divide the measurement volume into voxels to determine differences between applied and measured field strengths of magnetic fields at each sensor to determine a value at each voxel selected from the group consisting of a contribution of difference between applied and measured strengths of magnetic fields and a magnetic susceptibility and to construct tomographic images based on those values as MST images.

In an alternative embodiment a method of producing magnetic susceptibility tomographic MST images of an object includes providing an alternating magnetic field to a volume of an object from at least a first bias coil at a first frequency a second bias coil at a second frequency a third bias coil at a third frequency and a fourth bias coil at a fourth frequency the first second third and fourth frequencies being different measuring magnetic fields at a plurality of sensors disposed about the volume constructing a model in memory of a processor the model having multiple voxels representative of smaller volumes within the volume correlating currents of the bias coils to measured magnetic fields at each sensor of the plurality of sensors to determine an applied and an induced magnetic field at each sensor deriving magnetic susceptibility information for each voxel and producing an MST image indicative of magnetic susceptibility at voxels.

The present device and method provides for near simultaneously measuring intrinsic neural MEG and hemodynamic activity MST without any need for a contrast injection and can do so with high temporal and spatial resolution. The device and method solves the substantial technical problem of integrating two capabilities of the superconducting quantum interference device SQUID system and or atomic magnetometer system biomagnetometer measurement of magnetic susceptibility MST and magnetoencephalography MEG . Measuring neural activity with MEG is based on detecting the magnetic fields produced by active neurons. SQUID susceptibility measurement detects changes in the level of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood similarly to fMRI but with faster temporal sampling. By implementing magnetic susceptibility measurement of hemodynamics with alternating current AC modulation at high frequencies lock in amplifier and applied magnetic field compensation techniques may be used for the hemodynamic measurement and the hemodynamic measurement does not interfere with a simultaneous MEG measurement. This device and method enables high precision high resolution multimodal neuroimaging for scientific and medical applications of noninvasive imaging of neurovascular brain dynamics.

Injection of magnetic nanoparticles which may in some embodiments be antibody tagged gives enhanced contrast to the tissue that contains the nanoparticles in the susceptometry device and method. These particles may be modified to bind specifically to certain biological tissues such as tumors. Due to the high magnetic susceptibility contrast from the surrounding tissue the magnetic nanoparticles may also be detected and imaged with a fluxgate magnetometer based susceptometer that utilizes a similar AC bias field and tomographic reconstruction algorithms. The fluxgate susceptometer could be a fixed frame instrument or a portable hand held imager that is far smaller and far less expensive than SQUID based machines because the fluxgate also does not require use of cryogenic cooling and does not require a magnetically shielded room. An atomic magnetometer has low noise properties and exquisite sensitivity comparable to a SQUID sensor but does not require cryogenic cooling. Achieving the lowest possible noise measurements with a SQUID or atomic magnetometer requires use of a magnetically shielded room. Atomic magnetometers and fluxgates will operate outside of a magnetically shielded room but with greater noise from the environment that may overwhelm MEG signals while possibly allowing detection of MST signals.

A magnetic susceptibility tomographic device has sensitive magnetic sensors about a measurement volume and AC bias coils for providing magnetic fields within the volume. Magnetic field compensation coils reduce the field bias at the sensors to reduce the dynamic range requirements of the sensor electronics. Sensing circuitry reads the sensors and a processor executes magnetic susceptibility tomography MST routines from memory to divide the measurement volume into voxels to determine differences between applied and measured field strengths of magnetic fields at each sensor and to then determine a contribution of difference between applied and measured field strength or a magnetic susceptibility at each voxel and to construct tomographic images displaying difference between applied and measured field strength or magnetic susceptibility at multiple voxels as MST images. MST images may be reconstructed in three dimensional space or as two dimensional topographic images.

A method of producing magnetic susceptibility tomographic MST images of a subject includes providing an alternating magnetic field to a volume of a subject from two or more bias coils each modulated at a separate frequency. Magnetic fields at each of several sensors disposed about the volume are measured and currents of the bias coils are correlated to measured magnetic fields at each sensor of the plurality of sensors to determine an applied and an induced magnetic field measured at each sensor from each bias coil. The magnetic susceptibility at each voxel is then derived and displayed as an MST image.

The present devices and method also provides the use of nanoparticle labeling and scanning of materials and manufactured parts for the purposes of authentication track and trace and supply chain management. In this invention nanoparticles are embedded in and or on a part during the manufacturing process and later scanned by a susceptibility imaging device to retrieve the information contained in these nanoparticles.

The information contained in these nanoparticles could be imparted in several ways. One method is a blend of different size distributions and concentrations of nanoparticles that are mixed uniformly into a material. This combination could then be scanned by a susceptometer capable of spectroscopic analysis based on the amplitude and phase response of the magnetic nanoparticles as a function of frequency. The spectroscopic analysis would reveal the particular nanoparticle signature embedded in the material. Another method of embedding information contained in nanoparticle is spatial encoding of nanoparticles throughout the material or part. This spatial encoding would represent information in a 3 dimensional spatial pattern. Information could then be retrieved by a 3D magnetic susceptibility tomography of the part or material.

There are many applications for this invention. One would be to mix a nanoparticle signature into the epoxy backing of microchips. This application would provide an integrated nanoparticle signature that would make counterfeiting significantly more difficult. Another application would be to label repairs done with epoxy plastic or other materials such as concrete. A nanoparticle signature would be added to the material prior to the repair and this signature would correspond to a record of the repair for future inspection and reference. Another application is to label manufactured parts and 3D printed parts with an embedded label for tracking and authentication purposes. Another application is in construction and other applications where accurate mixing ratios are important. Magnetic nanoparticles could be added to the substrates or during the mixing process and later scanned to ensure proper mixing. An additional application is document labeling and authentication. Another application is tracking of tool wear and or liquid leakage by scanning residues for magnetic nanoparticle content.

Magnetic particles have been used in ink for document authentication and other applications but not at the size scale of nanoparticles. This is a significant difference because magnetic nanoparticles that are smaller than a single magnetic domain are paramagnetic or superparamagnetic rather than ferromagnetic which means that the particles do not carry a residual magnetization. This means that the susceptometer must actively probe the susceptibility with an applied field as opposed to reading a residual magnetic field. Paramagnetic and superparamagnetic materials may be exposed to high magnetic fields without damaging the information contained within the part or material. Since the nanoparticles are paramagnetic or superparamagnetic they do not retain any magnetic field after the susceptometry reader is removed so the nanoparticles will not interfere with sensitive equipment. This feature also makes the nanoparticle signature more covert because it will not trigger metal detectors or magnetometers. In addition the idea of distributing nanoparticles in a material in a 3D pattern to be later scanned allows for a much higher information density to be imparted into a part or materials than the surface application of ink.

With high enough information density from the proposed nanoparticle method highly complex digital codes or substantial amounts of digital information can be incorporated. This digital information could include for example time and date stamps from manufacturing product numbers test and validation data user manuals pricing information and re ordering information. Information could also be encrypted or non encrypted. Information could be related to the product that is marked or covert or overt for entirely different purposes such as advertising data transfer data storage and monetary authentication.

The proposed magnetic nanoparticle taggant method and reader device offers an inexpensive method for encoding parts with a signature that will live with the part throughout its lifecycle. This is a method for authentication tracking and supply chain management. It is also a method of labeling that can work on difficult products such as small parts or inexpensive parts. The method also solves labeling of parts in a non discrete fashion and materials like liquids cables tubes and other large parts can contain a distributed single label that ties all parts of the product together.

Magnetic neurological signals can be characterized by both their frequency and their magnetic field strength. In general brain activity occurs between 0.1 and 1000 Hz and the magnetic field strength from this activity as measured by MEG ranges from 40 2000 femtotesla. In order for a device to measure brain activity without the need for large amounts of signal averaging the noise either measured by or inherent to the device must be below the field strength of the brain signal at the frequencies of interest. For example the alpha rhythm occurs between 6 12 Hz and has field strength of roughly 1000 femtotesla. In order to measure this rhythm a device would ideally have noise much less than 1000 femtotesla between 6 12 Hz. This noise threshold is an extremely difficult barrier for many devices to overcome.

For liquid helium cooled MEG SQUID sensors noise is roughly 3.5 femtotesla Hz low enough for this type of measurement. High temperature SQUID sensors have noise around 40 femtotesla Hz which is low enough to measure most types of brain activity. Commercial MEG machines often use SQUID sensors a state of the art MEG system can measure fields ranging from 20 nanotesla down to the noise floor of 3.5 femtotesla corresponding to an inherent range to noise ratio of 5.7 10.

Sander has published a report on a chip scale atomic magnetometer that had a noise floor around 200 femtotesla Hz and they describe theoretical work that indicates that a noise floor of 3 femtotesla Hz may eventually be achievable T. H. Sander J. Preusser R. Mhaskar J. Kitching L. Trahms and S. Knappe Magnetoencephalography with a chip scale atomic magnetometer. Biomed Opt Express vol. 3 no. 5 pp. 981 990 May 2012. . With this device they were able to measure brain activity and stated that because of the sensors size the sensors were able to be moved closer to the brain. Since magnetic fields emitted from the brain drop off rapidly with distance this permits measurement of larger magnetic field strengths from the brain than practical with cryogenically cooled sensors like SQUIDs. Atomic magnetometers are estimated to have sensitivity ranges from roughly 1000 nanotesla down to the noise floor of 200 femtotesla corresponding to a range to noise ratio of 5.0 10. If an atomic magnetometer can be built that approaches the SQUID noise floor of 3.5 femtotesla then the range to noise ratio would be 3.0 10.

While these sensors have proven to have a noise floor small enough to measure brain activity another type of sensor that has yet to be able to make MEG measurements is a Fluxgate Magnetometer. The lowest noise floor we have found for a small Fluxgate is around 4000 femtotesla Hz. Even in the most optimistic case this type of noise would require experimentation where a large amount of averaging was possible. This could potentially be done in experiments where an input rhythm is tracked by the brain so that noise averaging could make up for the poor noise floor. However noise averaging inherently means that more data is needed to see the same result and so long tests are necessary.

A fluxgate magnetometer offers a sensor with reasonable bandwidth and a large measurement range to noise ratio. Fluxgates can measure magnetic fields from 100 microtesla to their noise floor of 10 picotesla which amounts to a range to noise ratio of 1.0 10. This type of range to noise ratio becomes important for magnetic susceptibility tomographic MST imaging of blood see below.

A MEG MST dual function system makes use of a magnetically shielded room MSR in order to minimize stray magnetic fields that may otherwise impair measurements. Some MSRs employ passive shielding materials such as layers of mumetal and aluminum. Other MSRs also employ active shielding by detecting the magnetic field disturbances and compensating for the detected noise with large coils placed on the walls of the MSR. Nonmagnetic subject positioning apparatus such as a wooden chair couch bed or recliner upholstered with foam padding but not springs is provided on which a subject may sit or recline and an array of magnetic sensors and bias coils are provided in a hemispherical sensor helmet . The helmet has an inner diameter sufficient to surround a measurement volume the measurement volume large enough to enclose most human heads in vivo and has magnetic sensors positioned to sense magnetic fields emanating from sources that may be positioned within the measurement volume. In an embodiment having superconducting quantum interference device SQUID magnetic sensors the sensor helmet is thermally insulated to prevent heat from either a subject or from the MSR from reaching the SQUID sensors and provided with Dewar reservoir apparatus that bathes the sensors in cryogenic liquids to keep the sensors cold enough to function properly. The sensor helmet is also provided with sensor electronics for using its magnetic sensors to measure magnetic fields as well as bias coils for providing an alternating current AC magnetic field and compensation coils for reducing the direct coupling of bias fields to the sensors which are used together for measuring paramagnetic properties of materials such as the living biological materials of a human or animal head including brain that may be placed within the helmet. The helmet is also provided with a mechanical support and positioning system that permits the helmet to be positioned about a head of a subject when the subject is on the subject positioning apparatus. In an embodiment a well shielded subject stimulus subsystem for visually and aurally stimulating a subject is also positioned to provide audio and visual stimulus to a subject within the MSR. The compensation coils are coupled to be driven by a plurality of compensation coil drivers the compensation coil drivers in turn coupled to the processor wherein the processor comprises machine readable instructions for controlling the compensation coils to cancel bias fields at the sensors. Similarly in an embodiment the bias coils are coupled to be driven by bias coil drivers the bias coil drivers in turn operating under control of processor .

It is anticipated that magnetic susceptibility imaging devices may be constructed with other shapes for imaging other biological materials. In an embodiment a cup shaped imaging head having structure similar to an inverted version of that described for the helmet including magnetic sensors bias coils and compensation coils placed below a hole in a platform such that a woman lying on platform may dangle her breast into imaging head which operates with electronics similar to that described herein with reference to SQUID sensor electronics power conditioning data acquisition coil drivers 

Since the sensors can pick up stray magnetic fields and such fields can be emitted by electrical currents in wiring as much as possible of system electronics is located outside the MSR. Further any electrical power required by apparatus such as SQUID sensor electronics that is positioned within the MSR is conditioned by power conditioning electronics to reduce fields at frequencies of interest from power line ripple power conditioning electronics also provides clean regulated power to lock in amplifiers data acquisition and bias coil and compensation coil drivers . Electronic portions of sensor electronics and stimulus system that are physically located within the MSR are magnetically shielded to reduce interference. A subject response device such as a pressure sensitive switch or touchpad is located where it may be reached by a subject on the subject positioning apparatus.

Signals from sensor electronics and response device and to stimulus system are preferably transmitted on optical fiber to prevent interference. Signals from sensor electronics are coupled to data acquisition electronics and filtering which provides digitized data to a digital processor and image processor having memory . Also operating under control of processor are High Q AC bias coil interfaces and coil drivers that are coupled to bias coils of the helmet .

In an embodiment helmet or inverted as cup has a magnetic shield as illustrated schematically in . Within shield are inner and outer Dewar walls that define its shape. These walls are bent upwards to form a helmet cavity also forming inner inner and inner outer Dewar walls. A space between inner inner and inner outer and between inner and outer walls is evacuated for insulation. A cooled space within the helmet is filled with cryogenic refrigerant and also contains multiple superconducting quantum interference devices SQUIDs positioned to detect and measure magnetic fields emanating from or modulated by a head of a subject that may be present within the helmet. Also included within the helmet are multiple bias coils for providing a magnetic field to the head of the subject the bias coils forming a layer between the SQUIDs or other sensors and head and configured to provide bias magnetic fields for sensing magnetic susceptibility in head . Also provided are multiple compensation coils forming a layer distal from head relative to SQUIDs that are used to null the bias magnetic fields at the SQUID sensors. In some embodiments one or more 3 axis ambient magnetic field sensor is included within a first layer of shielding the ambient magnetic field sensor is configured to measure stray magnetic fields such as those that may penetrate shielding and originate from sources outside the system and subject such as the Earth s magnetic field building wiring passing vehicles elevator motors air conditioners workmen s tools cellular phones and other sources. Readings from ambient magnetic field sensor may in some embodiments be used to provide compensating fields by adjusting electromagnets within the system and may be used to provide feedback to control current in ambient field compensation magnets not shown that provide fields determined to cancel ambient magnetic fields.

In some embodiments such as the embodiment illustrated in conventional non superconducting electromagnet coils are used for both bias coils and compensation coils . In the embodiment of intended for retrofitting to a pre existing SQUID based magnetoencephalograph bias coils are placed between Dewar and its layer of sensors and head while compensation coils illustrated as rings in are placed external to Dewar and its layer of sensors illustrated as rods in .

Where a magnetic susceptibility tomography machine is initially built for that purpose the bias coils and compensation coils may be in closer proximity to sensors as illustrated in .

It is anticipated that the magnetic susceptibility tomography images may require registration with anatomical images such as from MRI or with other functional images such as from fNIRS functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy neuroimaging . Fiducial markers may be used to facilitate this registration by providing a frame of reference that can be located in both imaging systems. Suitable fiducial markers for magnetic susceptibility tomography should have at least one portion with sufficiently different magnetic susceptibility from water and air to provide good image contrast and should be small enough in size to accurately model as magnetic dipoles. In some applications it may be desirable to use a calibrated standard for a fiducial. For these applications the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST SRM magnetic susceptibility standard 2 mm 3.42 mm platinum cylinder may be used. Alternatives are the NIST Magnetic Moment Standard Nickel Disk and the Nickel Sphere for Magnetic Moment. In other applications where the fiducial need only provide a reference mark other materials such as iron or iron oxide are used. Additional bias coils may be placed on anatomical landmarks and used as active fiducial markers. The signals from the active fiducial markers are generated by supplying AC currents to the active fiducial markers at specified frequencies that are reserved for this purpose. The signals from the active fiducial markers may be extracted from the sensitive magnetic sensor readouts using lock in amplifiers.

It is often desirable to have a fiducial that is visible in more than one imaging modality such that it may be used directly to register images as an alternative to relating a fiducial location to a known point of anatomy and finding anatomy in images. Some of these markers such as platinum cylinders and nickel disks are also visible in other modalities such as CT. If the same markers are to be used in alternative imaging techniques the markers may have one portion that is visible in MST and a second portion visible in a specific alternative imaging methodology. In an example fiducial the fiducial has iron oxide embedded in a plastic to provide contrast for MST the plastic enclosing an air bubble to provide contrast in ultrasound imaging. In a second example fiducial a fiducial both has magnetic particles or nanoparticles and high density so as to be visible in X ray and CT images such as iron oxide particles suspended in a lead casting the lead casting in turn covered with a biocompatible material and is visible in MST CT and MRI. In a third example fiducial a fiducial both has a plastic pedestal that can accept a capsule of iron oxide particles to provide contrast for MST or a capsule of vitamin E to provide contrast for MRI. The capsules may be exchanged in the plastic pedestal without removing the pedestal so that the collocation of the fiducial markers in the MST and MRI images is preserved. Fiducial markers may be adhered to anatomical landmarks with tape or biocompatible glue or implanted. The magnetic susceptibility tomography images can then be rigidly or non rigidly transformed until registered with the anatomical or functional images from another system.

A lock in amplifier is an analog or digital device used for noise reduction when an oscillatory signal of known frequency and phase is being measured and is illustrated in . The lock in amplifier may also be implemented in software routines in computer processor. To work effectively a REFERENCE signal of the same frequency as the oscillatory signal and a known phase is provided to the lock in amplifier along with the signal of interest SIGNAL. A lock in amplifier measures the frequency and phase of the reference signal and creates a sine and a cosine waveform. These reference waveforms are multiplied with the signal of interest in multipliers . This multiplication will result in a new wavefoini with several components. If the signal of interest contains a waveform at the same frequency and having a constant phase with respect to the reference then this new waveform will have an amplitude component proportional to this oscillatory component in the signal of interest. Other frequency components will be shifted in frequency space and random components like thermal noise will be reduced through averaging due to their non constant phase. Next the amplitude is extracted by low pass filtering the new waveform in filters . Finally the amplitude and phase of the signal are determined in Amplitude and Phase conversion block and the amplitude and phase outputs are provided in digital form as measures of the magnetic field for MEG or MST reconstruction by processor . This process is very effective at high sampling rates since noise is cancelled as a function of the square root of the sampling rate reduction from input to output. An analog device is able to achieve noise reduction of up to 60 dB while a digital device is able to reduce noise up to 120 dB.

Typically the dynamic range limit of a magnetic field sensor and or analog to digital converter ADC and or digital to analog converter DAC prevent a continuous wave CW AC susceptometry system from being able to achieve high levels of sensitivity. In an embodiment we overcome this limitation by using one or more compensation coils in combination with high precision ADCs and DACs to reduce the directly coupled signal from the bias coils or excitation field to sensors so that the available dynamic range can be applied fully to the signal of interest. The CW method using unique excitation frequencies combined with multiple compensation coils enables many measurements to be obtained simultaneously from the target region for tomographic image reconstruction. One of the advantages of using compensation coils is that the dynamic range of the analog to digital conversion ADC does not include the applied field because the net field at the sensor is a vector sum of the compensation field and bias fields and compensation fields are chosen to reduce net field at the sensors. Without the compensation coils the acquisition range for the ADC needs to encompass the directly coupled bias field making bit noise larger than the signal of interest from the sampled medium. The compensation coil approach solves this problem by reducing the direct coupling of the bias field into the sensors. Spatial distortion of the bias field in the medium being imaged can be accounted for in the tomographic imaging algorithm without any loss of resolution or sensitivity.

Several approaches can be taken to build the compensation circuitry. The most flexible is to use a DAC with enough dynamic range to produce a magnetic field capable of eliminating the bias field at the sensor while not increasing the noise measured at by sensor. In the case of a single bias field the bias field and the compensation field can have the same signal to noise ratio SNR but when multiple bias fields are in use the compensation field must be able to eliminate each bias field individually and thus must have a larger SNR than each bias field. It is possible to solve a system of equations to determine the compensation field strength for a system with many compensation and bias coils. A DAC has the ability to dynamically change the applied field to accommodate a calculated compensation level that is much harder to achieve with an analog system. Another method that can be employed to compensate a bias field is to use a combined analog and digital system. In this situation the analog system produces a compensation field close to the bias field strength. The digital system is be used to tune the field in order to achieve optimal compensation. In this way a high SNR analog signal could be produced in addition to a lower SNR digital signal and still achieve a high degree of compensation. Another compensation scheme is to precisely tune the bias and compensation fields during manufacturing and then use high precision manufacturing to create a fully analog compensation system with no digital components.

While magnetoencephalography directly measures magnetic fields associated with neural activity magnetic susceptibility tomography measures tissue composition and tracks changes to tissue composition. Changes in oxygenation of hemoglobin for example cause changes in magnetic susceptibility of blood that are detectable with the apparatus described herein.

Magnetoencephalography alone can be performed with the apparatus of by ceasing drive to bias coils and measuring magnetic fields emitted from a brain in a head located within the measurement volume using sensitive magnetic sensors such as SQUID sensors . The measured fields may then be mapped to produce tomographic images by processor executing magnetoencephalographic tomography routines from memory . The magnetoencephalographic tomography routines include machine readable instructions for directing processor to divide the measurement volume into voxels to determine field strengths of magnetic fields emitted from each voxel and construct tomographic images displaying those field strengths as images.

Simultaneous magnetoencephalographic tomography and magnetic susceptibility tomography is described below.

A SQUID magnetometer measures the magnetic flux density B in the direction u normal to the sensor coil Eqn. 1.

A SQUID gradiometer readout measures the difference in magnetic flux density B between its upper and lower coils in the direction of a unit vector u normal to the SQUID coils and relative to the separation of the coils d

In general the magnetic flux density B at position r from this arrangement contains a magnetic field strength H from free current I in the current loop and a magnetization field M from the magnetically susceptible material Eqn. 3. where is the magnetic constant or the magnetic permeability in a vacuum. Below saturation the magnetization field strength M in the sample at position s is linearly dependent on the volume magnetic susceptibility of material in the voxel and the magnetic field strength Eqn. 4. Magnetic Susceptibility

Magnetic susceptibility is a material property that describes the magnetic response of a material to an applied magnetic field. The magnetic susceptibility response occurs through the alignment or anti alignment of magnetic domains in the material. Several types of magnetically susceptible materials exist. The magnetic domains of paramagnetic materials will align with an applied field while the domains of diamagnetic materials will align against the field. Materials with a persistent magnetic field after being magnetized by an applied field are called ferromagnetic. Where ferromagnetic materials are in particle form having sizes less than approximately 50 nm the size for single magnetic domains the particles become superparamagnetic.

In the superparamagnetic state and in the absence of a magnetic field the average magnetization of nanoparticles will sum to zero if measured over a long time window. However the magnetic moment of a nanoparticle will have two stable orientations separated by an energy barrier. There exists a probability of flipping between orientations that is described by a time constant known as Neel Relaxation. These superparamagnetic nanoparticles also have very high magnetic susceptibility. Iron core nanoparticles are paramagnetic or superparamagnetic depending on the particle size.

Magnetically susceptible materials may be paramagnetic or diamagnetic . Diamagnetic materials are defined as having 0.

The relationship between magnetic flux density B and magnetic field strength H and magnetic susceptibility is 1 Eqn. 5

The magnetization M of a susceptible material is proportional to the strength of an applied magnetic field H. M H where is the volume susceptibility of the material. In an AC measurement is expressed as i where is the real or in phase component and is the imaginary or quadrature component of the susceptibility. This magnetization will result in an altered magnetic field B as measured from a sensor location.

In an embodiment the applied magnetic field H is created by driving electric current though a coil. The magnetic field strength produced by a coil is directly proportional to the input current. For a point outside of the loop but on the primary axis the field strength is 

In an embodiment the applied magnetic field H from bias coils is modified by driving electric current though a compensation coil that is differently positioned from the applied field or bias coil such that the combination of the applied field and compensation field results in a reduction of the total field at the sensor location.

Most biological molecules in the human body are diamagnetic which is defined as any material with 0 and is shown in however HbR is more precisely termed less diamagnetic than surrounding tissues. Table lists some representative biological susceptibility values. Under the assumption that the change in magnetic susceptibility of HbR is determined by the oxygenation state of the hemoglobin bound iron the magnetic susceptibility of a partially oxygenated red blood cell RBC is simply the linear interpolation between the oxygenated and deoxygenated RBC values given below as determined by the RBC s percent oxygenation.

Since brain tissue is not entirely blood cell it is expected that change due to function will be substantially less than these numbers resolution of 10to 10would be desirable.

The magnetic susceptibility of nanoparticles can be much greater than biological tissues. For example consider 110 nm FeOiron core nanoparticles from Micromod Gmb Rostock Germany . In a particular suspension these nanoparticles are concentrated at 8.13 mg Fe g and have a very high susceptibility of 6.5 10m kg as compared to water which has a susceptibility of 9.05 10m kg. The difference in susceptibility between these particles and water provides the contrast that is measured in nanoparticle contrast imaging. It is important to note that in biological studies these nanoparticles are highly diluted and therefore the effective susceptibility of a biological sample is much closer to that of water. For instance the concentration of nanoparticles might be diluted as much as a factor of 100 from the above. Typical concentrations range from 0.1 mg Fe ml to 0.5 mg Fe ml but may be much higher or lower in some applications.

Since the effect of concentrations of these iron core nanoparticles in tissue is to alter magnetic susceptibility of the tissue these nanoparticle concentrations can be located by magnetic susceptibility tomography as herein described and as performable with embodiments based on all three sensor types SQUID fluxgate and atomic magnetometer. Since high concentrations of nanoparticles can significantly alter magnetic susceptibility high concentrations of nanoparticles can be readily located even with equipment insufficiently sensitive to perform MST on unlabeled biological tissues.

Bulk magnetic susceptibility is the average physical property of a sample that describes the induced magnetic field produced by the matter when in the presence of an applied magnetic field.

A prior method to quantify susceptibility places a cuvette filled with the sample to be characterized in presence of a SQUID or other magnetic sensor and an applied magnetic field the applied magnetic field here provided by solenoid coils see . The sensor is placed within the applied field and field is measured. A sample is then placed within the field and the field at the sample location is re measured. The difference in the magnetic field measured with the sample present versus with the sample absent is a direct measure of the induced magnetic field and is used to calculate .

The measurement of bulk magnetic susceptibility has been used with three dimensional objects when an average value for a single body in space is desired. The applications of this technique in humans have included temporal characterization of the cardiac cycle and iron stores in the liver and spleen.

We are unaware of prior study of magnetic susceptibility in vivo in human or animal brains or of prior magnetic susceptibility tomography of human or animal brains.

Imaging hemodynamics with intrinsic magnetic susceptometry contrast is based on detecting small changes in the magnitude of the measured B field from local changes in the volume of deoxyhemoglobin HbR . The contrast from a sample of fully deoxygenated blood in water arises from the difference between for deoxygenated red blood cells 8.77 10 and water 9.03 10 which results in 2.6 10. The susceptibility of oxyhemoglobin HbO 9.05 10 is very close to water. It is also necessary to account for hematocrit which indicates the blood volume fraction comprised of hemoglobin 40 and the blood volume fraction in the grey matter of the brain 5 . This means that the maximum local field contrast from intrinsic susceptometry is 5.2 10times the applied field. Considering that it is desirable to detect functional responses of the brain from oxygenation changes on the order of a few percent and that the signal of interest is further reduced due to the distance between the brain and the SQUID coils the induced field contrast is 10 billion times smaller than the applied field. This corresponds to a minimum dynamic range dynamic requirement of 200 dB. Modern SQUID based MEG systems can measure between 20 nanotesla to a smallest bit of 2 femtotesla which is a dynamic range 140 dB. This means that prior MEG systems are 60 dB or 1000 times short of the necessary capability to make the susceptometry measurements. An applied field of 20 nanotesla would result in a susceptibility response from the brain on the order of 2 attotesla.

When enclosed in a high quality magnetically shielded room the noise from a SQUID system is dominated by the thermal noise of the SQUIDS. The thermal noise floor of a SQUID system is 3.5 fT square root over Hz above 1 Hz. Hemodynamics has slow physiological dynamics relative to neural activity. Most studies of neural dynamics with EEG and MEG use sampling rates of up to 500 1000 Hz whereas hemodynamics measured with NIRS which is not rate limited like fMRI uses sampling rates on the order of 10 50 Hz. The thermal noise from SQUIDs for hemodynamics is therefore also 1000 times larger than the susceptometry signal from a 20 nanotesla applied field. Overcoming this dynamic range gap and poor signal to noise ratio is essential to the present device.

Prior SQUID susceptometry overcomes the challenge of measuring blood by using uniform applied fields on the order 1 millitesla or even 1 T and gradiometers rather than magnetometers near the sample so that a susceptibility response on the order of 1 nanotesla can be measured. However this approach of using a strong applied field creates too much noise in the SQUIDs to simultaneously make MEG recordings of intrinsic biomagnetic fields from neural activity that is on the order of femtotesla to picotesla.

Our approach is to keep the applied field seen by the SQUID sensors within the 20 nanotesla range that permits low noise SQUID operation for MEG measurements while using additional instrumentation and methods to achieve sensitivity to the attotesla susceptometry signals. The increase in dynamic range and reduction of noise are accomplished by a combination of methods We use alternating current AC in the coils to generate the applied field. The components of the applied field from bias coils that are directly coupled to the SQUIDs are attenuated by mean of compensation coils . The geometric configuration of applied field and compensation coils exploit orthogonal arrangements positional offsets and size scales so that the compensation fields minimally attenuate the applied fields in the imaging region. This compensation scheme permits a much stronger applied field to be used than the 20 nanotesla range that permits low noise SQUID operation. The limit on the amount of increased applied field strength permitted by compensation is the noise introduced in the SQUID measurements at MEG frequencies of interest from the applied field and compensation coils rather than the amplitude of the applied field at the AC carrier frequencies. Available MEG systems have sampling rates of up to 5 kHz so the available frequency range is up to the Nyquist frequency of 2.5 kHz. Suppose a frequency of 1 kHz is used. By using a high Q factor oscillator the bandwidth of the oscillation frequency can be exceedingly narrow such as within 20 10of the oscillator frequency. Since any frequency instability in the high Q factor oscillator is coupled into the susceptometry signal of interest that is measured by the SQUID sensors a lock in amplifier is used to greatly reduce the noise in the desired amplitude measurement prior to analog digital conversion in data acquisition and filtering unit . The needed reference signal is obtained by precisely measuring the current in the oscillator coil. Currently available lock in amplifiers using a quality reference signal can reduce noise levels by 60 120 dB. The noise reduction from the lock in amplifier is proportional to the square root of the bandwidth of its bandpass filter centered on the modulation frequency. SQUID sensors have an inherent bandwidth on the order of 1 10Hz and SQUID MEG systems are sometimes configured to have sample rates of 1 10Hz to 1 10Hz. This high sample rate of SQUID MEG systems means that the bandpass filter in a lock in amplifier can have an exceedingly narrow bandwidth even for a short data record. The signal to noise improvement achievable with the lock in amplifier is enough to overcome the 60 dB deficit and measure susceptometry signals from the brain with a signal to noise ratio that is much greater than one. When used with a SQUID system with a high sampling rate the resulting bandwidth of the hemodynamic estimate can be on the order of 10 Hz or more. Further reduction of noise is possible by using multiple AC bias coils each of which will result in an independent measured signal in the magnetic sensor. The bias coil geometry may also be designed such that the applied field at the sensor location is minimized while maintaining a strong field at the tissue. This can be done for example by using a spatially uniform applied field with SQUID gradiometers. The uniform field will not excite the SQUID sensors but the local magnetization of the susceptible material will result in a measurable magnetization field.

An alternative approach to the lock in amplifier is to use digital signal processing DSP to track changes in the oscillator frequency and then to use linear regression to fit the amplitude of the oscillator signal in the SQUID over short time window e.g. 500 samples or 0.1 s . There is a cost advantage to the DSP approach because less hardware is required. When digitizing with an analog to digital converter ADC it is advantageous to use a system with a high number of digitization bits such as 32 bits to obtain the needed 200 dB signal to noise ratio. There are additional methods for ADC error compensation including methods for reducing quantization error. The applied AC magnetic fields from the bias coils act effectively as sinusoidal dithering signals. By averaging over a finite time window and imparting a dither signal that spans a wide bit range the effective number of bits is increased by 10 or more. The trade off for this extra precision is a slower sampling rate for the hemodynamics than the neural dynamics but this this can be done while still maintaining an order of magnitude speed advantage over fMRI.

In an embodiment having a fluxgate magnetic sensor no magnetically shielded room is required no Dewar reservoir apparatus is required because no cooling with cryogenic fluid is required. The bias coils and compensation coils for the fluxgate embodiment may be placed around or beside the fluxgate sensors in any desired configuration. Configurations that provide multiple angles of applied field to the region of interest are desirable.

For fluxgate imaging of magnetic nanoparticles the applied field strength can be much greater than for a SQUID MEG system. The sensing range of fluxgate systems varies by manufacturer. For example the FVM 400 MEDA Inc. Dulles Va. is a vector magnetometer that can measure magnetic fields in the range of 100 microtesla with 1 nanotesla noise. The Mag 03 three axis magnetic field sensors Bartington Instruments Limited Oxford England has a range capability of up to 1 millitesla and a low noise sensor capability of 6 picotesla noise which is close to 180 dB of signal to noise. The signals from nearby fluxgate magnetometer sensors that share a common axis may be differenced to obtain a magnetic field gradient along the common axis. A wide dynamic range fluxgate with time averaging enables measurement or imaging of intrinsic contrast from hemodynamics like the SQUID system except without the MSR and cryogenic cooling. A disadvantage of using a fluxgate for measurement of hemodynamics is that fluxgate sensors lack the ultra low field measurement capability that is needed for simultaneous MEG measurement.

MST is a noninvasive method of imaging the distribution of the physical property of magnetic susceptibility through a part of the body or non biological material and functional magnetic susceptibility tomography fMST is a noninvasive method of imaging changes in the distribution of magnetic susceptibility due to changes in brain function or any reason for time variation in the magnetic susceptibility property of the material being imaged. Both MST and fMST require an applied magnetic field to the material so that the material under examination will produce an induced magnetic field. The induced magnetic fields are then measured with fMST requiring rapidly repeated measurements. In an embodiment the apparatus herein described measures magnetic fields with an effective sample rate of greater than or equal to ten hertz significantly faster than the half hertz achievable with functional magnetic resonance imaging.

In practice the spatial reconstruction of volume magnetic susceptibility through the use of magnetometers has been successful in one and two dimensional systems.

One dimensional methods use a presumed shape often a sphere for an object of interest. Within the presumed shape an average susceptibility is solved for by assuming that the object s is uniform. Finally a linear equation relating the of the object of interest the applied magnetic field B and the magnetometer location and orientation is created and solved. One dimensional methods do not provide an image.

Similarly the two dimensional methods assume a sample of uniform thickness. Since a two dimensional reconstruction is used the is assumed to be uniform in the direction of thickness. The measurements are typically performed by moving a sample through a uniform field with fixed sensor locations alternative measurements may be made by moving sensors past a fixed sample. The resulting measurement is a convolution of the applied field with induced fields generated in the sample. The measurements are then deconvolved using Green s function to produce resolutions better than 1 mm by accounting for the spatial correlation of the magnetic fields.

To date three dimensional methods of MST have not been implemented but the analytical groundwork for one method has been developed. The first step of this method is the voxelation of a computer model of sample space in memory of processor by dividing a measurement volume within the helmet into multiple voxels. Following the voxelation of the sample space the induced dipole relation is computed for the centroid of each voxel. While this method is applicable for non uniform fields this method has only been analyzed for uniform fields thus far although Sepulveda et al. do recognize that non uniform fields could be beneficial to the reconstruction N. G. Sepulveda I. M. Thomas and J. P. Wikswo Magnetic susceptibility tomography for three dimensional imaging of diamagnetic and paramagnetic objects . vol. 30 no. 6 pp. 5062 5069 1994. . The contribution of each dipole is then calculated for each sensor dipole pair. The number of the sensor dipole pairs in this method is set high enough so as to guarantee an over defined systems. This fundamentally sets the ratio of the number of voxels to number of measurements. The system is then solved in three dimensions by using singular value decomposition. The prior literature on MST is either limited in the dimensions that can be reconstructed or the number of measurements required for reasonable spatial resolutions on size scales of clinical interest.

Of the existing MST techniques the two dimensional methods have typically used specialized small scale SQUID magnetometer arrangements often with a single sensor coil with a surrounding Helmholtz coil to provide a uniform field in the imaging space. The sample is then moved through the imaging space while the remainder of the apparatus remains fixed.

The one dimensional methods have used two principle approaches. The first is more common in geological investigations where a magnetometer or an array of magnetometers is swept over an area. The location of the sensor s is then matched to the sensor readings to achieve estimates of the average underlying . The other method relies on an advanced assumption of the underlying shape of interest and is often used in clinical imaging to estimate hepatic or splenic iron content. Typically this method uses magnetometers to measure fields in the presence of an applied field with a spherical shape assumed for the organ of interest and the subject is slowly moved into and or out of the sensor sensitivity region during data acquisition.

The MST method introduced in the present work reconstructs for a three dimensional volume and does not require an over defined system thus lowering the number of required measurements.

A forward model operable on the processor models the sensitivity of the system s magnetic sensors to variations in magnetic susceptibility throughout the imaging volume and impact of each. The forward model was generated by breaking the imaging volume into rectilinear elements referred to as voxels. The applied magnetic field strength was determined for the centroid of each magnetic sensor. This applied field was then used in combination with modeled spatially varying magnetic susceptibility to calculate the strength of the induced magnetic field at each voxel. This induced magnetic field was then projected for all voxels onto the sensor locations.

The magnetic field strength form the free current can be computed by integrating the Biot Savart law around the circular loop which approximates wire as an infinitely thin conductor. The resulting field has a closed form solution Smythe W R 1967 3rd ed McGraw Hill New York p. 623 . A circular loop in the xy plane carrying current I will generate the magnetic field strength Hat the center of the loop in the z direction

The x and y components of the field are computed from the Cartesian components of the radial field cos Eqn. 14. sin Eqn. 15. where is obtained from the four quadrant inverse tangent function tan 2 Eqn. 16.

Defining the magnetic field strength from a coil at arbitrary position and orientation requires additional transformation steps. Suppose the coil is centered on a point in Cartesian space x y z where the coil is oriented normal to the unit vector u uuu and the objective is to compute the magnetic flux density from the coil at position x y z . The first step is to define the rotation matrix

Evaluating the field equations at x y z yields the magnetic flux density in the transformed frame H H H . The solution at the desired position requires the application of a final inverse rotation to the magnetic flux density components

If the coil geometry is not well approximated by a single current loop but instead has the shape of a cylinder or annulus then the geometry and total current I can be discretized and summed to obtain a numerical integral approximation to the more complex coil.

The magnetic field H HHH from eqn. 21 can be now evaluated in the material sample in the imaging volume H s in eqn. 4 for computations of the magnetization field M s and can be evaluated at the location of the SQUID coils H r for its contribution to the magnetic flux density B r in Eqn 3. The magnetization field contribution to the magnetic flux density at the SQUID coils M r will be derived in a later section.

The magnetic field H HHH from eqn. 21 can also be evaluated for each of the excitation coils at the location of the magnetic sensors. This direct coupling of the applied field to the sensors can pose practical problems if it exceeds the dynamic range of the sensors or ADC instrumentation. A solution to this problem is to supply compensation fields with a number of compensation coils that equals the number of sensors. The physical positions and or size of the compensation coils must be different from the applied field coils such that the applied field and compensation fields cancel each other at the sensor locations but do not cancel each other in the imaging volume. This can be accomplished by arranging the compensation coils with different offsets or angles with respect to the sensors than are used for the applied field coils.

In an embodiment with multiple AC bias fields from one or multiple bias field coils the compensation coil gain may be separately adjusted for each of the bias field frequencies to null the bias field at the sensor for all of the frequencies simultaneously. The in phase and out of phase compensation gains are calculated separately when in phase and out of phase references are available. The in phase and out of phase components can also be calculated simultaneously using a single reference in quadrature.

In an embodiment with multiple AC bias fields and multiple sensors there is the potential for direct coupling between the all of the compensation coils and all of the sensors. In this case the compensation coil gains Gto Gmust be adjusted simultaneously to null the total bias fields Hat all frequencies and all sensor locations s to sN. The simultaneous adjustment of all compensation coils can be performed using direct linear inversion of a compensation coil coupling matrix that tabulates the H contributions of the compensation coils c to cN at unity gain to each of the sensors s to sN. The compensation coupling matrix multiplied by the compensation gains results in the compensation field components measured by the sensors

The tuned compensation gains Gto Gare obtained by inverting the compensation coupling matrix and multiplying the resulting inverted matrix by the negative of the AC bias field strengths bT at the sensors s to sN

The compensation coupling matrix can also be calculated from measurements at multiple gain levels and then fit with a regression model to help reduce the effects of measurement noise. Nonlinear search algorithms such as nonlinear least squares gradient descent and the simplex method may also be used to perform the simultaneous adjustment of all compensation coils. The compensation coils also be tuned to bring the sensor readings to any arbitrary values other than zero to bias the sensors as desired. The compensation coil tuning can be tuned once for the purpose of reducing the directly coupled field. The compensation coils also could be tuned repeatedly to compensate for bias fields that are environment dependent or could be tuned continuously based on a reference magnetic field measurement for active noise cancelation.

The applied magnetic field strength at the centroid of each voxel is assumed to apply uniformly throughout the voxel which is a reasonable assumption when the voxel size is small relative to its distance from the current loop of the electromagnet. The magnetization field from the voxel can be computed as the integral of a differential magnetic dipole over the volume of the voxel. The total magnetization field from the imaging volume is then obtained by summing the contributions of all the voxels.

If the magnetic field strength H is assumed constant within the voxel then the solution to eqn. 29 can be expressed in closed form. To make the resulting expression more compact it is helpful to separate the solution into components Eqn. 30. where Eqn. 31. Eqn. 32. . Eqn. 33. By symmetry of the rectangular cuboid we will have Eqn. 34. Eqn. 35. Eqn. 36. where r y z x and L L L L . Similarly we have Eqn. 37. Eqn. 38. Eqn. 39. where r z x y and L L L L . The solution can now be completely expressed by the M field components from an applied H field in the z direction. The x and y components are

The hyperbolic arctangent function is infinite when the argument is positive or negative unity which occurs at geometric positions on the surface of the voxel planes extending from the voxel surfaces and lines extending from the voxel edges. The mathematical singularities at these locations always occur in positive negative pairs so they can be avoided by defining

The magnetization field contribution M r can be substituted into eqn. 3 to obtain the magnetic flux density at the SQUID coils as observed through eqn. 1 and eqn. 2. The result is the spatial distribution of the B field resulting from the magnetic susceptibility of a single voxel. The spatial distribution was then numerically evaluated at each of the sensor locations. These operations were then performed for all voxels and the results are summed at each sensor location.

In an initial DC SQUID configuration using a modified MAGNES 1 Biomagnetic Technologies Inc. San Diego Calif. the majority of the sensors are first order coaxial spatial magnetic SQUID gradiometers. Thus the vector of induced field calculated above was dot multiplied with the unit normal vector of each sensing coil and then the difference for each coil pair was calculated. This modeled value is equivalent to the measurement from the Magnes I.

The forward model discussed above can be written in the form Eqn. 48 where is the forward model and has the dimensions sensors by voxels is the matrix of magnetic susceptibilities and is a column vector that is voxels long and is the measurement column vector that is sensors long. The matrix accounts for the applied field the geometry and discretization of the source space and the sensor geometry. Tomography

The implemented method evaluated was the Moore Penrose pseudoinverse. This method arrives at a unique inverse matrix by adding the additional constraint that the L2 norm of the estimated susceptibility vector is minimized. The qualitative result of this constraint is to preferentially weight estimates of the magnetic susceptibility nearer to the sensors. This trend is accounted for by the fact that the field strength of a magnetic dipole falls off as

We performed experiments that show that the spatial and temporal recording of magnetic susceptibility for a MST tomographic image using low power applied magnetic fields and a MEG tomographic image in a configuration usable for human studies is possible using the same equipment. Images from both modalities can be displayed separately or a combined image having colors indicative of data obtained from both modalities can be generated. Such a composite image could be termed a MEG MST image and would have an MEG component representing neural activity and a MST component representing tissue composition. Additionally the computational analysis of magnetic susceptibility tomographic reconstruction within the MEG s imaging space should result in images with good temporal and spatial characteristics. The combination of these studies implies that a high fidelity spatiotemporal tomographic image is possible with this configuration.

It is anticipated that differences between measured and applied fields representative of induced fields in materials within the measurement volume are mapped to produce tomographic images by processor executing magnetic susceptibility tomography MST routines from memory . The MST routines include machine readable instructions for directing processor to divide the measurement volume into voxels to determine field strength differences between applied and measured magnetic fields at each voxel and to construct tomographic images displaying information derived from those field strength differences as MST images representative of magnetic susceptibility at each voxel. In a particular embodiment magnetic susceptibility is derived from those field strength differences and displayed as MST images.

It is also anticipated that the field strength difference and or magnetic susceptibility voxels of the MST images described above and the field strengths of voxels of the MET routines may be represented together as a composite tomographic image by composite tomography routines in memory of the processor.

In order to increase sensitivity and improve tomographic reconstruction by identifying contributions of field and susceptibility at particular sensor elements from particular bias coils we propose using alternating current instead of direct current in the bias coils to produce alternating magnetic fields within the measurement volume.

In an embodiment the bias coils are driven by drivers not with direct current but with an AC modulating current and this current is measured with a high precision analog to digital converter in data acquisition unit . Each sensor is also read with a high precision analog to digital converter in data acquisition unit and measurements from the sensors are correlated using a multivariate linear regression operating in the processor to detect small changes in amplitude over several cycles of the AC modulating current.

It is expected that the combination of linear regression comparing current in bias coils to sensor measurements with AC modulation will provide greater sensitivity to minute induced fields and changes in those minute fields than obtainable with our previous DC SQUID measurements.

Further by operating each of particular bias coils at a different frequency and separating detected magnetic field signals from the sensors according to frequency we can identify an induced field component at each sensor that is associated with each of the particular bias coils.

For example if we have four bias coils and eight sensors a first bias coil is driven at a first frequency the second at a second frequency the third at a third frequency and the fourth at a fourth frequency. At each sensor the received signals representing detected magnetic fields are individually correlated against the first second third fourth and in embodiments using additional frequencies the additional signals measured at each bias coil including a first and a second bias coil of the bias coils to give an induced field contribution of each bias coil at each sensor. In a particular embodiment the received signals representing detected magnetic fields are digitized and digitally correlated by linear regression against the first second third fourth and in embodiments using additional frequencies the additional digitized signals measured at each bias coil to give an induced field contribution of each bias coil at each sensor. In an alternative embodiment a separate lock in amplifier is provided at two or more of the sensors for each of the first and second or more operating frequencies thereby allowing determination of induced field contributions of each bias coil at each of these sensors. This system is expanded by adding additional bias coils operating at additional individual frequencies and by adding additional sensors. It is anticipated that embodiments may have several hundred sensors and several dozen bias coils where each bias coil operates at a different frequency. We term this AC induced field measurement with linear regression and frequency domain separation of individual bias coil contributions.

In addition to improving sensitivity the induced field component of each bias coil at each sensor is used by processor to further disambiguate and enhance resolution during enhanced tomographic reconstruction.

When using many bias coils the summation of the bias fields from all active coils must be within the operating range of the SQUID or fluxgate sensor. Although this may appear to significantly limit the number of bias coils that may be used the distance of the bias coils relative to the sensor reduces the excitation field at the sensor and mitigates the potential problem. The use of compensation coils also mitigates problem of direct coupling of the applied or bias field to the sensors by locally cancelling the applied fields at the sensor locations. The orientation of the bias coils is also chosen so that the field experienced by each sensor is substantially less than the field that targets the imaging region of interest. While it is essential that the applied field from the bias coils excite the tissue the function of the sensor is to read the signal component from the excited tissue so having reduced direct coupling from the bias coils to the sensors is beneficial.

Some embodiments both of SQUID Atomic Magnetometer and Fluxgate types have bias coils and sensors that are grouped to reduce the total number of independent bias signal generators and independent AC operating frequencies required for MST. In a particular embodiment there are two groups one associated with each hemisphere of the brain. Each group has one bias coil operating at each AC stimulus frequency. In this embodiment signals from sensors associated with the left hemisphere are coupled through single pole double throw relays or equivalent devices to the lock in amplifiers during a first MST measurement then the relays are switched and sensors associated with the right hemisphere are coupled through the relays to the lock in amplifiers during a second MST measurement. In other alternative embodiments other groupings of coils and sensors may be used.

Some available magnetoencephalographic machines using SQUID sensors have bandwidth of as much as 5 kHz others have bandwidth of 1 MHz 100 MHz or as high as 1 GHz. The useful bandwidth for magnetoencephalography is however primarily zero to 200 Hz. In an embodiment we apply the bias coils to a head surface of a helmet of such a machine.

In addition to AC induced field measurement with linear regression and frequency domain separation of individual bias coil contributions we use AC currents of greater than 200 Hz in all bias coils of the machine. Further we digitally low pass filter data read through the data acquisition system from sensors in processor to separate a magnetoencephalographic signal from the AC magnetic susceptibility signal described above with reference to AC induced field measurement with linear regression and frequency domain separation of individual bias coil contributions.

In this way our system is capable of simultaneously acquiring magnetoencephalographic and magnetic susceptibility data suitable for MET and MST. We use the term frequency domain separation of MET and MST herein to indicate separating MET and MEG data by recording MEG data at low frequencies such as below a threshold frequency like 200 Hz while simultaneously capturing MST data by AC susceptometry as described above using bias coils driven at higher frequencies such as above a threshold frequency like 200 Hz. In other embodiments a higher threshold frequency such as 1000 Hz may be used.

For MST of hemodynamics from local regions of the brain where the total quantity of brain tissue involved is on the order of 100 mm and the evoked hemodynamics are on the order of a few percent change in blood oxygenation a signal to noise ratio of 10may be required. The required signal to noise ratio is lowered by the use of compensation coils by a factor of 100 or 1000 or more depending on the noise characteristics and precision of the compensation coil and circuitry. While it is unlikely that any magnetometer will have this type of performance this signal to noise ratio is achievable by employing a precise bias oscillator signal and an analog or digital lock in amplifier. Lock in amplifiers use the reference signal to measure frequency and phase locked signal component of interest even when noise is much higher than the signal itself. The achievable level of signal to noise amplification from a lock in amplifier is on the order of 10to 10 depending on frequency precision and phase stability of the reference signal and the frequency bandwidth of the magnetometer. Reference signals with stability up to 1 part per billion are readily available. The bandwidth of the magnetometer is thus the limiting factor on the signal to noise amplification of the lock in amplifier.

The SQUIDs themselves have a bandwidth of up to 1 GHz but the bandwidth of the associated SQUID electronics is typically limited by the particular signal transmission lines and circuits in the system. Some SQUID MEG systems are designed to operate with a bandwidth of 100 MHz or more.

The embodiments heretofore discussed use SQUID based magnetic sensors. These require cryogenic liquids for operation in one embodiment using traditional SQUIDs requiring liquid helium and in an alternative high temperature embodiment using less sensitive high temperature SQUIDs requiring liquid nitrogen. While liquid nitrogen is lower in cost than liquid helium both are inconvenient and expensive and require extensive and heavy thermal insulation including vacuum insulated Dewar s.

In an alternative embodiment no shielded room is provided since only induced field measurements are performed for MST of tissue and or MST of nanoparticle concentrations while the very low magnetic fields of MEG are not measured. In this embodiment power conditioning apparatus provides clean power to lock in amplifiers data acquisition and bias coil drivers to prevent interference from power line ripple. Bias coil drivers provide current to drive bias coils that provide AC magnetic fields of known intensity to tissue and or nanoparticle concentrations in a subject or portion of a subject such as a subject s head . The bias coil drivers operate under control of processor to provide particular patterns of AC magnetic fields that will permit processor to localize concentrations of paramagnetic materials in subject

Sensitive flux gate sensors are provided to perform AC measurements of magnetic fields applied to and induced within subject . In embodiments with analog lock in amplifiers readings from the flux gate sensors are amplified with lock in amplifiers digitized by data acquisition and filtering unit coupled to lock in amplifiers and processed in processor as described above to recover signals from the minute induced magnetic fields and to perform frequency domain separation of individual bias coil contributions to the induced fields. In embodiments with digital lock in amplifiers readings from flux gate sensors are amplified digitized by data acquisition and filtering unit and further processed by digital lock in amplifiers coupled to data acquisition and filtering unit before further processing in processor to recover signals from the minute induced magnetic fields and to perform frequency domain separation of individual bias coil contributions to the induced fields.

Fluxgates have a bandwidth of typically 1000 Hz but sometimes as high as 3000 Hz this high frequency capability permits use of AC lock in amplification and digital correlation techniques to quantify signals from minute induced fields. In some embodiments measurements of induced fields may be performed with bias coils energized in different patterns and induced field measurements from each pattern of bias coil energization are combined to provide accurate MST reconstruction for example bias coils may be energized with bias coils turned off then bias coils energized with bias coils turned off to provide additional spatial resolution. Once the induced fields for all sensors are quantified these measurements are used to perform MST tomographic reconstruction as heretofore described.

In another alternative embodiment a shielded room may be provided to gain additional noise reduction.

It is believed that the regression signal recovery technique heretofore discussed will permit operation for MST with flux gate sensors in place of SQUIDs and thus permit enhanced portability and reduced operating costs by eliminating the need for cryogenic liquids.

CSAM devices as illustrated in have a cell filled by an alkali metal vapor such as cesium vapor and operate by measuring changes in light transmitted to a photosensor from a polarized incident laser beam. Additional optical components exist in each cell such as diffraction gratings that are not shown in .

An embodiment of the MEG MST resembling that of but using atomic magnetometers uses a sensor helmet as illustrated in . This helmet has a magnetic shield fabricated of a magnetic material and configured to surround a head or other portion of anatomy of interest of a subject. Within the shield are an outer shell of bias coils each of which is coupled to a driver in a bias driver module attached to the shield . Bias coils are configured to apply alternating current magnetic fields to induce induced magnetic fields in the magnetically susceptible materials or magnetic nanoparticles within head . An inner layer within the bias coils are located an inner shell of atomic magnetometers .

Tomographic images generated from MEG and MST operations are generated by processor system displayed on a display device not shown and transmitted over a network to an electronic medical records EMR database server not shown where they are entered into an EMR record of the particular subject.

In an alternative embodiment bias coils and magnetometers are attached to an elastomeric cap configured to be worn on head .

The CSAM described by Sander has a bandwidth of 150 Hz but this bandwidth will increase in future atomic magnetometers. A high bandwidth CSAM will permit use of high frequency AC susceptometry and lock in amplifiers to further increase dynamic range and sensitivity to weak MEG and MST signals.

The effective capability of a particular magnetometer for MST can be calculated as the range to noise ratio times the square root of the bandwidth divided by the desired hemodynamic sampling rate. Using a threshold of 10 billion for MST of hemodynamics in the brain and a 10 Hz sampling rate for the hemodynamics the bandwidth requirement can be evaluated from range to noise ratio sqrt bandwidth sample rate 10. The range to noise ratio for a SQUID MEG is 5.7 10 for a fluxgate is 1.0 10 and for a CSAM is 5.0 10. The minimum bandwidth requirement for a SQUID system is 31 MHz for a fluxgate it is 10 MHz and for a C SAM system is 40 MHz. The bandwidth requirement is within the known operating range of a SQUID MEG. For the CSAM the bandwidth is too high for current models but we expect this will be overcome in newer models very soon. The bandwidth requirement is too high for the fluxgate since this sensor type does not operate in the MHz range. Fluxgates could however still be useful for MST of large changes in hemodynamics from larger regions of the brain that are persistent or slow to change in time such as from a stroke. For example for a hemodynamic change that is 10 times larger than a typical small evoked response and a hemodynamic sampling rate of 0.1 Hz the fluxgate minimum bandwidth requirement is 1000 Hz which is well within its capability.

There are two competing factors for an MEG MST imaging system. One is the absolute noise floor of the sensor and how that relates to the ability to detect brain activity and the other is the ability to detect minute magnetic susceptibility changes from blood in the brain. Presently available SQUID sensors satisfy both requirements present fluxgate sensors satisfy the MST requirement but are only capable of measuring the very largest of MEG brain rhythms. CSAM presently meets the MEG requirements but would require time averaging for MST requirements. Modifications to the SQUID system to achieve higher bandwidth will further improve its MST performance and future improvements to CSAM could make it viable for MST and MEG. All three sensors are easily capable of measuring MST signals from magnetic nanoparticles. All three sensors could thus be used for MST if magnetic nanoparticles are used as a contrast agent.

Alternative types of magnetic field sensors may be used in applications where larger magnetic field signals are present such as with magnetic nanoparticle taggants or where magnetic nanoparticles are injected into a subject as a contrast agent treatment agent or both. Alternative types of magnetic field sensors are induction coils Hall effect sensors and magneto resistive sensors. These sensors types may be discrete sensors chip based sensors or manufactured onto a printed circuit board in an array configuration.

The term sensitive magnetic sensors as used herein therefore includes both sensitive flux gate sensors atomic magnetometers and SQUID sensors.

In particular embodiments including some of those that operate outside a shielded room it may be desirable to apply a superimposed direct and alternating current to one or more bias coils. For example an embodiment may provide to one or more of its coils a direct current sufficient to generate a magnetic field sufficient to cancel the earth s magnetic field with a small alternating current determined to be sufficient to cancel interference from nearby power distribution lines with an alternating current at a particular frequency superimposed on the direct current that provides an alternating magnetic field for sussceptometry. This embodiment may also provide a reference at that particular frequency to lock in amplifiers for low noise amplification of signals from sensitive magnetic sensors disposed along with the tissue being examined within the alternating magnetic field. For purposes of this document driving circuits that provide a superimposed direct and alternating current to a bias coil are referenced as providing an alternating current to the bias coil.

In some embodiments particularly when the sensor bandwidth is low and time resolution requirements are modest it may be desirable to use time multiplexing rather than frequency encoding to uniquely identify the field contributions from particular bias coils and their interactions with a magnetically susceptible sample. In the time multiplexing approach one bias coil is activated at a time in a predetermined sequence. Knowledge of the time sequence is then used to parse the measured signals into contributions from each of the bias coils interacting with the sample. A complete sequence of parsed signals can then be used in tomographic image reconstruction routines in the memory of a processor.

In particular embodiments where the susceptibility properties of the sample medium are strongly frequency dependent it is anticipated that multiple MST tomography images of the same sample medium may be reconstructed. In an embodiment one MST image is reconstructed using a set of low frequency AC bias coil frequencies a second MST image is reconstructed using a set of medium frequency AC bias coil frequencies and a third image is reconstructed using a set of high frequency AC bias coil frequencies wherein each of the three images contains different magnetic susceptibility information content about the sample medium. In a particular embodiment the three images are differenced by image processor so that high low frequency difference images can be displayed thereby highlighting regions with high difference between high and low frequency susceptibility. In some embodiments for example when the sample medium has time varying material properties the use of three sets of AC bias coil frequencies may be multiplexed in time so that a time series of images is obtained using the low medium and high frequencies is cyclically obtained over time. In a particular embodiment an initial set of images is stored and differences determined between the initial set of images and a later set of images by image processor so that time difference images can be displayed thereby highlighting regions where susceptibility has changed the susceptibility changes may for example result from introduction of a magnetic nanoparticle contrast agent into the medium.

It is anticipated that the systems herein described may capture data associated with MST sufficiently quickly to provide dynamic MST tomographic image series producing an display of changes to magnetic susceptibility in the head with an effective frame rate greater than that achievable with fMRI images and thereby enable functional MST or fMST. Although the dynamic MST tomographic images will provide useful information regarding brain function even at low effective frame rates of several frames per minute in a particular embodiment dynamic MST with an effective frame rate of at least five hertz is expected.

It is anticipated that the apparatus herein described may be adapted for determining magnetic susceptibility tomographic images from a whole body or from other portions of a body than the head alone as heretofore described although such embodiments may not be able to simultaneously provide magnetic encephalographic information.

Although the apparatus above described for MST is not compatible with simultaneous fMRI because of the intense and varying magnetic fields required for fMRI it is anticipated that the apparatus heretofore described is compatible with simultaneous functional neuroimaging fNIRS. We have already demonstrated compatibility of simultaneous fNIRS with DC SQUID based MET and magnetic susceptibility measurement. We expect to be able to perfaini simultaneous fNIRS and MST using AC bias techniques as above described as well as simultaneous fNIRS MST and MET using AC bias and frequency domain separation of MST and MET data as herein described. Further should electrodes and conductors be carefully chosen to avoid electrodes or wiring containing magnetic metals we expect to be able to perform simultaneous electroencephalography EEG and MST simultaneous EEG MST and MET simultaneous fNIRS EEG MST or simultaneous fNIRS EEG MST and MET or any other combination of fNIRS EEG MST and MET.

A specific advantage of the proposed use of multiple bias coils and multiple magnetic sensors is that spatial encoding may be performed to enhance the tomographic resolution beyond what is possible by the linear combination of multiple independent sensors. The spatial encoding method relies on selection of the frequencies of pairs of bias coils that are spatially separated to achieve beat frequencies that result from constructive and destructive interference in the spatial region between the two bias coils. This interference signal will contain new information for spatial encoding if the combination of applied fields results in a nonlinear phase and or amplitude response by the magnetically susceptible material. Such a nonlinear response can arise from magnetic field saturation effects and also from nonlinearity in the magnetization frequency response of some materials. The spatial extent of the interference field will be focused in the region between the coils because the field magnitude from each coil decays with distance from the coil. The sensitivity region of the interference field is localized to the product of the field magnitude map from the two coils. The spatial extent of an interference field will in general be more localized have smaller spatial extent than the field pattern from an individual coil. Measuring the susceptibility response associated with the interference field will therefore enable higher resolution tomographic reconstructions over the use of individual coils.

Achieving improved resolution from spatial encoding at the desired bandwidth for time variation in susceptible material imparts additional constraints on the selection of the bias coil frequencies. Specifically the beat frequencies must be higher than the desired sampling rate to capture time variations in the susceptible material. For example if a sampling rate of f 10 Hz is desired for imaging hemodynamics and the frequency of the first bias coil f 1000 Hz then the frequency of the second bias coil must be f 1010 Hz. Suppose that f 1010 Hz was chosen. The beat frequencies for the interference field between the coils would be f f f 10 Hz and 2010 HZ. The lower of the two beat frequencies is of interest f 10 Hz. The beat frequency acts as a virtual bias coil that applies an AC magnetic field to the spatial region of the interference field.

The magnetization information from the beat frequency interference field may be extracted from the signal of any magnetic sensor that is within range of the applied fields. The signal measured by the magnetic sensor s is separately notch filtered at the bias field frequencies fand f. The notch filters are needed to isolate the beat frequency of the two bias coils in question with respect to all other potential bias coil pairs. The resulting signals sand sare then multiplied s sto demodulate the beat frequency from bias field frequencies fand fdown to the beat frequency f. The signal s sis then analyzed using a lock in amplifier or linear regression where the reference signal is an oscillator at the beat frequency f. The low pass filter in the lock in amplifier or linear regression method must have a cutoff frequency that satisfies f f which in this example could be a cutoff of 10 Hz to enable a sampling rate of 10 Hz on the time variation of susceptibility due to hemodynamics. An alternative approach to the interference signal analysis is to square the magnetic sensor sand then analyze the results using a lock in amplifier or linear regression with a reference signal that is the product of the two bias coil oscillators s s s. Using a reference signal that is the product of the two bias coil references will isolate the beat frequency of the two bias coils in question with respect to all other potential bias coil pairs.

A major advantage of this proposed spatial encoding method is that the effective number of bias coils will increase proportionally to the number of coils squared rather than linearly as the number of bias coils. If the number of bias coils is N the effective number of bias coils from the spatial encoding approach will be N N N N 2 N N 2. Tomographic resolution is proportional to the effective number of bias coils multiplied by the number of magnetic field sensors S that are within range of imaging volume. The number of unique measurements is what limits the number of voxels that may be uniquely reconstructed in the tomographic operations. Without the spatial encoding approach the resolution limit is the product SN. With the proposed spatial encoding approach the resolution limit is S N N 2. For a large imaging volume some magnetic field sensors will not sense from the entire imaging volume so in practice the resolution limit will be somewhat lower but the relative gain in tomographic resolution from the spatial encoding will be preserved.

Therefore in some embodiments as illustrated in signals received at each sensor such as sensors are digitally correlated by linear regression against each such as a first second third and fourth or more frequency applied to bias coils where each bias coil is individually driven at one frequency by bias drivers . Further in some of these embodiments signals received at each sensor are digitally correlated by linear regression at beat frequencies such as difference or sum frequencies such as frequency A applied to bias coil and frequency B applied to bias coil of frequency pairs applied to adjacent bias coils to give a spatially resolved induced field contribution of each bias coil at each sensor such as frequency A B . Where sensors are adjacent to multiple bias coils such as sensor induced field contributions are measured at multiple frequency difference pairs such as frequencies A B and B C. In an alternative embodiment a separate lock in amplifier is provided at two or more of the sensors for each of the first and second or more operating frequencies and at each difference frequency of interest at those sensors thereby allowing determination of induced field contributions of each bias coil at each of these sensors by selectively amplifying signals that may appear at the beat frequencies.

A lock in amplifier having the ability to detect signals at two reference frequencies and at a beat frequency is illustrated in this amplifier may be implemented in analog or digital signal processing hardware. A first reference frequency input and a second reference frequency input are provided the reference frequencies correspond to bias coil frequencies. In this amplifier the reference frequencies are conditioned by phase locked loops phase shifters and 90 degree phase shifters . The input signal is multiplied by outputs of phase shifters in multipliers for both first and second reference frequencies. Similarly the input signal is multiplied by outputs of 90 degree phase shifters in multipliers for both first and second reference frequencies. As with the single channel lock in amplifier illustrated in the outputs of first reference frequency multipliers are low pass filtered and processed to determine outputs representing magnitude and phase of input components at the first reference frequency. Similarly the outputs of second reference frequency multipliers are low pass filtered and processed in an amplitude and phase detector to determine outputs representing magnitude and phase of input components at the second reference frequency. Each of the first and second outputs resembles an output of a single channel lock in amplifier.

This amplifier then combines signals from both reference channels by multiplying the outputs of multipliers and in multiplier and the output of multipliers in multiplier to get signals incorporating components of both reference frequencies and the square of the input signal these signals are low pass filtered in filters and processed in amplitude and phase detector to give an output representing input signal components at a beat frequency representative of a sum and or difference of the first and second reference frequencies.

Objects may be tagged with magnetic nanoparticles in one of two ways through embedding in the object a particular size distribution of nanoparticles as illustrated in where an object has embedded within it small nanoparticles mid sized nanoparticles and large nanoparticles each in a particular concentration. In an embodiment two bits of a binary identifier are encoded with each size of nanoparticle with 00 represented by absence of particles of that size 01 a small concentration 10 a midsized concentration and 11 a large concentration. With three sizes of nanoparticles a 6 bit code is encoded. It is anticipated that additional concentrations and additional particle sizes can be used thereby increasing the number of usable bits beyond six.

In an alternative embodiment an object is tagged through positioning nanoparticle concentrations in a particular spatial distribution within the object as illustrated in . The nanoparticles may be organized as bars in a single dimensional bar coded distribution in a two dimensional grid pattern as illustrated in with a binary bit of a code represented by presence or absence of nanoparticles at a particular location or in a three dimensional array pattern. In an embodiment nanoparticles present at a location represent a binary 1 and absent at a location represent a binary 0 of an object identification code.

In an alternative embodiment additional information is encoded in an object by using two or more nanoparticle material compositions in conjunction with the size and concentration encoding illustrated in and the spatial distribution encoding illustrated in . For example magnetic nanoparticles may be formulated from iron II III oxide known as magnetite Fe3O4 and magnetic nanoparticles may also be formulated from iron III oxides such as gamma phase maghemite Fe2O3 where the magnetic susceptibility properties of these two formulations are different and distinguishable using the MST system or the simplified system of . In an embodiment nanoparticles identified to be magnetite represent a binary 1 and nanoparticles identified to be maghemite represent a binary 0 of an object identification code.

The MST system above described is usable to detect and map one two and three dimensional patterns of magnetic nanoparticles in an object such as one tagged in accordance with thereby serving as a detector for patterns of magnetic nanoparticle taggants in an object. Similarly the MST system is capable of detecting nanoparticle size distributions and detecting nanoparticle material compositions so is also capable of serving as a detector for objects tagged with nanoparticle concentrations as described with reference to .

In the presence of an applied magnetic field the AC susceptibility response of magnetic nanoparticles has in phase and out of phase components that vary as a function of frequency particle domain size material composition and temperature. This makes it possible to retrieve information encoded in a bulk material by adjusting the ratio of various particle size distributions as illustrated in . This information can be retrieved from any point in the material with a simplified multi frequency AC susceptometry reader as illustrated in that is significantly simpler than a full MST machine. The reader has an adjustable multifrequency coil driver coupled to drive bias coils that flank a sensitive magnetic detector . Data from magnetic detector is passed to a processor that also controls the coil driver . For example it is possible to make a magnetic nanoparticle credit card with its number or a validation code encoded in a nanoparticle size distribution that is mixed uniformly throughout the plastic. In an embodiment processor contains firmware for driving the coil driver taking data from the detector determining a nanoparticle distribution determining whether the nanoparticle distribution meets predetermined criteria for specific code elements such as binary bits or bit pairs and in an embodiment for determining whether the specific code elements match an expected or valid code. In alternative embodiment processor contains firmware for driving the coil driver taking data from the detector determining a nanoparticle distribution determining whether the nanoparticle distribution meets predetermined criteria for specific code elements such as binary bits or bit pairs and looks up the code in a small database to determine a product identity.

A simplified reader capable of reading a one or two dimensional pattern of magnetic nanoparticle distributions as discussed with reference to is illustrated in . In this reader processor controls and configures coil driver to drive bias coils with an AC field perpendicular to sensor and reads sensor to provide a measure of magnetic susceptibility . A mechanical scanner not shown for simplicity operates to scan object surface under control of a second processor a scan control and distribution processor having firmware for assigning magnetic susceptibility readings to specific locations verifying whether the magnetic susceptibility readings meet predetermined criteria and thus correspond to presence or absence of taggant at each location and whether the taggant meets predetermined criteria for specific code elements such as binary bits or bit pairs and verifying presence or absence of a valid code.

It is also possible to combine spectroscopic and spatial encoding. These features make the magnetic nanoparticle taggant approach far more robust than traditional magnetic ink for non destructive inspection and anti counterfeit applications. The reader resembles that of .

New component fabrication methods such as 2D and 3D printing may also benefit from the magnetic nanoparticle taggant method. Photopolymers used in additive manufacturing processes like stereolithography may embed low concentrations of nanoparticle taggants. The proposed use of superparamagnetic nanoparticles has distinct advantages over conventional magnetic inks and magnetic strips. Conventional magnetic encoding uses multi domain ferromagnetic materials that can be magnetized to encode information but can also be demagnetized. Single domain magnetic nanoparticles are superparamagnetic so they have a strong magnetization response in the presence of an applied field but there is no residual magnetization. This means that the signature cannot be removed from the material or read with a conventional magnetic reader. There is also no residual magnetization to possibly interfere with sensitive components like integrated circuits. Tagging with magnetic nanoparticles is important in non conducting i.e. insulating materials such as polymers ceramics and composites that are used in critical applications in aerospace civil infrastructure industrial and consumer products.
