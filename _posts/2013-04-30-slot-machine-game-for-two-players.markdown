The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present invention is directed to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods and more particularly to wagering games gaming machines networked gaming systems and methods having a slot machine game for two players including a shared feature game.

In the prior art various types of gaming machines have been developed with different features to captivate and maintain player interest. In general a gaming machine allows a player to play a game in exchange for a wager. Depending on the outcome of the game the player may be entitled to an award which is paid to the player by the gaming machine normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming machines may include flashing displays lighted displays or sound effects to capture a player s interest in a gaming device.

Another important feature of maintaining player interest in a gaming machine includes providing the player with many opportunities to win awards such as cash or prizes. For example in some slot machines the display windows show more than one adjacent symbol on each reel thereby allowing for multiple line betting. Feature games of various types have been employed to reward players above the amounts normally awarded on a standard game pay schedule. Generally such feature games are triggered by predetermined events such as one or more appearances of certain combinations of indicia in a primary game. In order to stimulate interest feature games are typically set to occur at a gaming machine on a statistical cycle based upon the number of primary game plays.

Some gaming machine games today include one or more progressive prize awards. In some configurations the progressive prize may have a small probability of a player winning it thus making it possible to have a larger progressive prize. In other game configurations the progressive prize may be a small amount thus allowing the player patron to win the progressive prize more frequently. In most typical game configurations the player wins the progressive prize as a result of a specific game outcome within the primary or main game.

Gaming machines have traditionally been under the control of a single player. While single player gaming machines including feature games and progressive prizes have been very successful there remains a need for games that provide a shared multi player game experience.

In accordance with one embodiment of the invention a gaming machine includes a processor and a game playable by each of a first and second player under control of the processor. Each of the games includes a plurality of indicia bearing reels and a game board comprising a plurality of locations the plurality of reels operable to display an outcome including a random display of their indicia. A token may be positioned at one of the plurality of locations of each game board in response to the respective game outcome. One or more feature games shared by both the first player and the second player may be triggered according to the positions of the tokens on two game boards.

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention a wagering game for two players utilizes two different sets of reels with two separate board games each board game displayed around one of the reel sets. Various outcomes of spins of the two sets of reels cause a token on each of the players respective game boards to advance to different positions on the board. At least some of the board positions are associated with prizes which may be won by the corresponding player. At least one board location is common to both boards. When both players tokens land on that location a common feature game is triggered.

In accordance with one embodiment of the invention entitled Meet Me in the Middle the reels include advance symbols that serve to move each player s token around the board. The board game consists of blank locations and award locations with a Middle Jackpot location shared between the two boards. There are two types of awards simultaneous awards and individual awards. Simultaneous awards occur when both players land on like award locations. There are two types of simultaneous awards free games and the middle jackpot.

Free games are awarded when both players tokens land on a Free Game location at the end of reel spin. The includes the case in which one player was previously on a Free Game location and did not advance while the other player advanced their token and subsequently landed on a Free Game location.

The middle jackpot feature is likewise awarded when both players tokens land on the common Jackpot location at the end of a reel spin. This too includes the case in which one player s token was previously on the Jackpot location and did not advance while the other player s token advanced and subsequently landed on the Jackpot location.

In one embodiment once awarded the same simultaneous award will not be immediately awarded again if neither token advances on the next spin. In alternate embodiments the players may be awarded simultaneous awards repeatedly if their tokens do not advance.

Individual awards occur when one player s token lands on an award location at the end of a spin. An example embodiment offers three types of individual awards two times total win three times total win and mystery awards. The two and three times total win awards multiply the total award won on the corresponding players side. Note that it is possible for a player to have no winning outcome displayed on his reels in which case he would receive no award despite his token having landed on a multiplying award location. In one or more embodiments the mystery awards pay two three four or five times total win two or three times total bet or automatically advance both players to the Middle Jackpot award location.

Other types of simultaneous or individual awards might include but are not limited to wild reels pick a tile bonuses alternate base games poker games keno games roulette games etc.

In one embodiment once a player s token has landed on an individual award location the same Individual Award will not be awarded again in the case that on the next spin following an Individual Award the player does not advance their token. In alternate embodiments the player might be awarded and Individual Award repeatedly if their token does not advance.

Other features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the various embodiments.

Various embodiments are directed to a game gaming machine gaming networks and method for playing a game wherein the game includes adjustable multi part indicia. The embodiments are illustrated and described herein by way of example only and not by way of limitation. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown illustrative examples of games gaming machines gaming networks and methods for playing a game in accordance with various aspects of the invention.

An example game in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention is shown in . Referring to game is implemented using two sets of spinning reels and each associated respectively with Game One or Game Two . A set and of 25 pay line patterns per game as illustrated by 1 25 and 26 50 respectively passes through one indicium on each of the five reels associated with a game. For example pay line 1 of set extends horizontally through the middle row of each of the five reels . The number of pay lines and their patterns are by way of example only and may vary.

Referring again to the player of each game Game One or Game Two selects a number of pay lines to play and a number of credits or coins to wager on each line using touch screen controls or gaming device control buttons. Win paid meter and credit meter provide the players with information about the amount paid by the last game played and the total number of credits available for play. BET meter displays the total of the currently selected wagers and of both players. The players may collect the balance of the credits shown by credit meter by pressing a collect button not shown .

In accordance with one embodiment the players initiate game play by selecting an amount to wager on their respective games Game 1 and Game 2 by way of one of five wager amount buttons 25 credits per line 50 credits per line 75 credits per line 100 credits per line 125 credits per line or 125 credits per line as illustrated by . A wager must be made on both games however wager amounts may differ between games. The amount wagered on each game is displayed in game bet meters and . The cumulative amount wagered on both games is displayed on bet meter . The bet meters may display a credit amount wagered a cash amount wagered or both. In some embodiments the players may select less than all pay lines a different number of credits wagered on each line etc. using buttons similar to those of on gaming machine or touch screen buttons which perform the same functions. One player presses a SPIN button and reels and are made to spin and stop in predetermined stop positions. A determination is then made whether the stop positions of the reels resulted in a winning game outcome for either Game 1 Game 2 or both.

In accordance with one embodiment of the invention the players may view a pay table as illustrated by associated with the reel games by way of a help or similar button not shown . In alternate embodiments pay table may be presented on a second video or printed display attached to the gaming device. A winning combination for example might be three or more symbols adjacent to one another on an active pay line. For each winning combination the game device pays the award in the pay table adjusted as necessary based on the number of credits wagered on the pay line on which the win occurred. For example three JACKPOT symbols adjacent to one another from left to right on an active pay line might pay 50 times the amount wagered on the game.

In some embodiments various primary game outcomes may be utilized to trigger the play of a feature game including but not limited to awarding feature play when certain symbols appear on a pay line when certain symbols are scattered when no symbols of a certain type appear when a certain winning combination occurs or regardless of the visible symbols at random or fixed intervals. The availability of the feature game may be restricted based on the size of the cumulative wager.

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention a wagering game utilizes two different sets of reels with two separate board games Game One and Game Two displayed around each reel set and respectively. Various outcomes of spins of the two sets of reels cause a token on each of the respective game boards to advance to different positions on their boards. At least some of the board positions are associated with prizes which may be won. At least one board location is common to both boards. When both tokens land on location a common feature game is triggered.

While the experience for the players is of two separate base games the overall game may be implemented as one game similar to multi hand poker. As shown above the two reel sets are identical and use the same pay table structure. All reels indicia and weights of indicia on the reels may be identical between the two games. The artwork colors may vary between the two games otherwise the games may be the same. The presentation of two base games creates a community game atmosphere for the players while the implementation employs game mechanics commonly found in single player multi hand poker or blackjack games such as a single bet meter single credit meter money in and out mechanisms etc. For example when two players sit down to play they decide how much money to place on credit meter . Similarly any wins are combined on single win paid meter . It is also possible for a single player to play both games simultaneously.

In accordance with one embodiment of the invention entitled Meet Me In the Middle the reels include advance symbols that serve to move each games s token around the board in a clockwise direction. Each board game includes blank locations and award locations with a Middle Jackpot location shared between the two boards. There are two types of awards individual awards and simultaneous awards.

In accordance with one embodiment or the invention individual awards occur when one token lands on an award location at the end of a spin. The current embodiment exhibits three types of individual awards 2 times total win 3 times total win and mystery awards . The 2 and 3 times total win awards multiply the total award won on that players side. Note that it is possible for the qualifying base game to have no winning outcome and therefore receive no award despite the token having landed on the award location. Examples of mystery awards include but are not limited to 2 3 4 or 5 times total win 2 or 3 times total bet or automatic advancement of both tokens to Middle Jackpot location or another location. In one embodiment once a token has landed on an individual award location the same individual award will not be awarded again in the case that on the next spin following an individual award the token does not advance. In alternate embodiments the individual award may be awarded repeatedly if the token does not advance.

As shown by in accordance with one embodiment simultaneous awards occur when both tokens land on like award locations. There are two types of simultaneous awards Free Games and the Middle Jackpot. In accordance with one embodiment a simultaneous award is not awarded again should neither token advance so the tokens remain on the same like award locations. In alternate embodiments the simultaneous awards may be awarded repeatedly until one of the tokens advances.

As illustrated by and in accordance with one embodiment of the invention free games may be awarded when both tokens land on a Free Game location at the end of a reel spin. This may include the case in which one token was previously on a Free Game location and did not advance while the second token advanced and landed on a Free Game location .

Referring again to in accordance with one embodiment of the invention the Middle Jackpot feature is similarly awarded when both tokens land on the common Middle Jackpot location at the end of a reel spin. This may include the case in which one token was previously on the Middle Jackpot location and did not advance while the other token advanced and landed on the Middle Jackpot location .

In accordance with one or more embodiments further illustrates various aspects of the Middle Jackpot feature introduced in above. The feature is awarded when both tokens reside on a common Middle Jackpot location at the end of a reel spin. In one or more embodiments play of the Middle Jackpot feature game may require a minimum individual or cumulative wager on each game. Both players or a single player are presented with a matrix from which each may pick four masked award locations. The players take turns revealing their respective awards until all eight selected awards have been displayed. The displayed award values are summed for each side and displayed in bonus win meters and . Both awards are then posted to credit meter and normal game play resumes.

The simultaneous and individual awards above serve as examples other kinds of bonuses may be available to the players as either simultaneous or individual awards. Additional awards might include but are not limited to wild reels traditional pick a tile bonuses alternate base games poker games keno games roulette games wheel games and the like.

In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention progressive prizes may be awarded as part of primary or feature game play. The progressive prizes may be calculated by a progressive controller such as a controller manufactured by Mikohn Inc. The progressive controller monitors wagering during base game play calculates a current value for one or more progressive jackpot pools and transmits the current pool values to the gaming machine. In one or more embodiments progressive awards are accumulated during regular play as a percentage such as three percent of the game play take. The prizes may be sized according to the preferences of the casino operator. The number of prizes may vary without deviating from the scope of the invention. The size of the prizes is dependent on the amount of play prior to initiating feature play and may come from the contributions of a single gaming machine or a number of linked gaming machines. In another aspect the prizes may be set amounts established by the casino operator from non coin in funds such as marketing funds.

In one or more embodiments the prizes for feature game play may be accumulated based on funding mechanisms other than a percentage of wagers accumulated by the gaming machine. For example an operator may initially fund various award pools with a pre determined amount of money such as 1000 for one progressive 500 for a second progressive 100 for a third progressive and so on. Subsequently the casino operator may determine to increase the amounts of one or more of the awards at pre determined times which may be periodically or randomly selected with a range of times or periods. Once a winner has occurred at any level the award levels may be rolled back to the initial funding level. In one or more embodiments only the winning award level is rolled back to the initial funding level.

In one or more embodiments the prizes for feature game play may be set amounts i.e. non progressive. In one or more embodiments the algorithms to determine the amounts may be determined by a statistical percentage based on an average take of a gaming machine and the likelihood of the win over a period of time. In the case where one or more gaming machines are networked a common award table may be utilized where the award algorithms are determined based on an average take total wagers of all the networked gaming machines and the likelihood of a win of an award over a period of time. Each award may be calculated in a similar manner based on the likelihood of a winning outcome being achieved during a game play session.

The additional displays may or may not include a touch screen or touch glass system.

Referring to electronic gaming machine is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player interface devices over bus lines . Printer is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . Base game integrated circuit board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus line . GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers connect through audio mixer and bus lines to base game integrated circuit board and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on base game integrated circuit board PIB and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a two player slot machine game having one or more shared feature games as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through bus line to gaming machine processor board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU gaming machine processor board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I O board may be connected to gaming machine processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS gaming machine processor board executes a game program that causes gaming machine processor board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a two player slot machine game having one or more shared feature games. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventionally and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player or players have inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of I O board to gaming machine processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player s may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to a player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the players may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally gaming machine processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset gaming machine processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from gaming machine processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus line . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the gaming machine processor board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database. In one or more embodiments despite the two player aspects of the game only one player s activity may be tracked due to the single platform nature of gaming machine such as single bet win meters and a single card reader connected to GMU .

All reporting to the player tracking server is consistent with standard single game video play. Since the game described above processes a single total wager and credits a single total win reporting to the server is similar to the operation of a single machine multi hand poker game.

PIB includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PIB such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PIB or playable on a connected network server and PIB is operable as the player interface. PIB connects to card reader through bus line display through video decoder and bus line such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provide messages and information to the players. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PIB such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PIB either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PIB . Additionally soft keys connect through bus line to PIB and operate together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PIB in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and bus lines and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

The system components include the iVIEW processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iVIEW can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of gaming machine processor board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a operating system layer such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system layer and itself contains a major component called the I O board server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O board server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system layer s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system layer and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system layer which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library routines and I O board server or between library routines and certain drivers in operating system layer . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. operating system layer is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard processor board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O board server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The game event log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a callback posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O board server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O board server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O board server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O board server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O board server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.
