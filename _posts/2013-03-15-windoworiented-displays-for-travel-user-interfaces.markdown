title: Window-oriented displays for travel user interfaces
abstract: Vehicular travel may be facilitated by user interfaces presenting travel information. Such user interfaces often involve visual displays positioned peripherally to a window through which an individual operates the vehicle (e.g., displays mounted in a dash or console) and/or non-visual interfaces (e.g., audio, speech recognition, and manual controls). While presenting visuals on the window obscuring the view of the individual may present safety concerns, peripherally presented visual interfaces that distract the gaze of the individual may raise comparable or greater concerns. Instead, visual user interfaces may be displayed on the window through which the individual operates the vehicle (e.g., a windshield or individual eyewear) to presents visuals representing travel information received from a travel service, such as routing, traffic congestion, highlighting vehicles or routes, and rendering non-visible objects (e.g., obscured traffic control signals). Such user interfaces enable user interaction while allowing the individual to maintain gaze through the window.

Within the field of vehicle travel many scenarios involve a user interface configured to present information to an individual operating the vehicle such as a map of a travel region indicators of locations on the map that may be of interest to the user a route selected by the individual navigation directions and traffic congestion information. Such devices often communicate with remote services for up to date travel information such as traffic conditions in the travel region and along the route of the individual.

However significant problems may arise if the device obscures the vision of the individual or distracts the individual from the operation of the vehicle. Accordingly the user interfaces of such devices are often designed to interact with the individual in a peripheral manner. As a first example while the user is operating the vehicle while looking through a window a device involving a display is often positioned peripheral to the window e.g. portable devices are often positioned on or integrated with a dashboard or center console of the vehicle that the viewer may view with peripheral vision or a momentary glance. As a second example many such devices are configured to interact with the individual in a non visual manner for output e.g. text to speech interfaces and tactile interfaces such as vibration and for input e.g. voice command interfaces and touch interfaces such as dials that provide an audible or tactile click when manipulated .

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

While legitimate concerns may arise in the context of user interfaces presented to an individual during the operation of a vehicle such concerns may not be fully satisfied by limiting such user interfaces to the periphery of the individual s attention. Such peripheral interaction may in fact exacerbate the distraction of the individual e.g. momentary glances or interaction with devices positioned in the periphery of the individual s view may divert the individual s view through the window of the environment of the vehicle and may dangerously slow the individual s reaction to urgent changes in travel conditions. Accordingly it may be advantageous to integrate the user interfaces with the view of the individual through the window while operating the vehicle.

Presented herein are techniques for facilitating an individual in the operation of a vehicle while looking through a window where such techniques involve displaying visuals on the window that present travel information received from a travel service. For example a projector may project a visual display on the window of the vehicle and or a liquid crystal display LCD may be integrated with the window of the vehicle and such devices may relay information to the individual as selectively positioned visuals on the window. The selective positioning may indicate and or highlight objects viewable through the window may supplement the view through the window with objects that are not visible e.g. a significant traffic control device that is obscured by another vehicle and or may present visuals in peripheral areas of the window that are closer to the primary viewing area of the window than dash or console mounted displays. Additionally the window displayed user interface may be interactive in various ways e.g. upon receiving user input from the individual that is associated with a visual such as eye gaze at a gaze position near a selected visual and a focal depth that is focused on the window the device may interpret the user input as a selection of the visual and may supplement the presentation with additional information received from the travel service that is related to the selected visual. In this manner the travel user interface integrated with the window through which the individual operates the vehicle may supplement rather than obscure or distract from the individual s safe operation of the vehicle in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In many such scenarios the manner of presenting information to the individual during the operation of the vehicle may be complicated or problematic due in significant part to the split attention of the individual between the device and viewing the travel region through the window . As a first example the physical positioning of the device within the vehicle may obscure the view of the individual through the window while operating the vehicle . In order to alleviate such obscuring such devices are often physically located at a periphery of the view of the individual such as mounted on or integrated with a dashboard or console of the vehicle where the individual may be able to view the device using peripheral vision or a momentary glance away from the window and toward the device . However the peripheral position of the device within the interior of the vehicle may significantly distract the attention of the individual e.g. if positioned far to the periphery the device may be unable to be viewed with peripheral vision and also the individual may not also be able to view through the window with peripheral vision while glancing at the device . This distraction may slow the reflexes of the individual and pose a potentially dangerous distraction. Conversely the peripheral positioning of the device in the interior of the vehicle may render the individual unable to view the device at a significant moment e.g. the device may display a significant visual while the individual is watching an urgent development through the window and the individual may therefore miss some travel information provided by the device . As a third example the device may comprise a touch sensitive visual indicator that the individual may touch to provide user input to the device but the positioning of the device within the interior of the vehicle may make the device inconvenient to touch particularly while operating the vehicle and therefore the individual may be unable to interact with the device at a significant moment. As a fourth example the device may present visual depictions of objects that are visible through the window but it may be difficult for the individual to correlate the visual depictions and the viewable objects e.g. the device may display a map with a route including a nearby road but the individual may have difficulty determining which of several nearby roads the device indicates . These and other disadvantages may arise from the positioning of the device peripheral to the window through which the individual is operating the vehicle .

Presented herein are techniques for providing user interfaces that may facilitate an individual in the operation of a vehicle . In accordance with these techniques a user interface may be integrated with the window through which the individual views the travel region while operating the vehicle . As a first example the window may comprise a windshield of an automobile motorcycle boat or airplane. As a second example the window may comprise eyewear worn by the individual through which the travel region is viewed. In these and other scenarios the window may present elements of a user interface that present visuals representing travel information received from a service such as visual indicators of routes traffic congestion road hazards locations status information about the vehicle and other vehicles. Notably such visuals may be presented on a primary area of the window through which the individuals views the travel region to operate the vehicle such as indicators that highlight and annotate a road and the vehicles traveling thereon. Alternatively or additionally the presentation may be located in a peripheral portion of the window such as near the top of the window where relevant driving information is not often viewable. While legitimate concerns exist that some such embodiments may obscure the vision of the individual through the window other embodiments may facilitate the view of travel region by individual through the window and that such presentation may be safer and more helpful than presenting such information peripheral to the window such as a dash mounted device that takes the individual s gaze away from the road. Additionally the window presented user interface may enable interaction with the individual for the selection of elements and the indication of information.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

The techniques may also be applied to various types of individuals in the operation of such vehicles e.g. pilots navigators and operators of supplemental vehicle equipment .

As a second variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may involve many types of visuals travel information and travel services . As a first example of this third variation the visuals may represent many types of travel information received from many types of travel services such as a travel map of a travel region a travel route a travel route instruction a traffic congestion location a road hazard location within the travel region a refueling location a travel way descriptor such as traffic control mechanisms e.g. stop signs traffic signals and speed limits of a travel way a location of a second vehicle a status indicator of the vehicle e.g. a fuel level or engine performance characteristic highlights of travel related objects such as vehicles operated by other individual known to the individual e.g. a second vehicle that the individual is following and or other vehicles that are also participating in the travel service and a travel visit suggestion such as locations of interest within the travel region or along the route of the individual . As a second example of this third variation such information may be received from many types of travel services such as a local data store integrated with the device e.g. a locally stored map and routing database a traffic congestion broadcast such as a Traffic Information Service Broadcast TIS B and a remotely accessible map or routing service such as a cloud based mapping service.

As a fourth example of this third variation Additionally many types of visuals may be displayed on the window to represent the travel information such as text colored shapes icons two or three dimensional graphics and highlighted regions of the window . Many such variations may apply to scenarios in which the techniques presented herein may be effectively utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques involves the types and architectures of the devices and components and the interoperation thereamong that may implement variations of the techniques presented herein.

As a first variation of this second aspect the device may vary with respect to the vehicle . As a first such example be integrated with the vehicle such as an in dash navigation system. As a second such example the device may comprise a portable device such as a mobile phone tablet laptop or portable global positioning system GPS receiver that is temporarily and or releasably positioned or used within the vehicle . As a third such example the device may implemented in a wearable computer such as eyewear e.g. glasses goggles helmets or headsets fabric integrated computing devices wristwatches and embedded biological devices.

As a second variation of this second aspect the device may involve an interaction of two or more devices to implement the techniques presented herein. As a first such example the device may include a geopositioning device configured to identify a location of the vehicle for transmission to the travel service or may receive the location from another geopositioning device within or outside the vehicle . As a second such example the device may incorporate a communication device that is in communication with the travel service or may interact with a communication device embedded in the vehicle e.g. an on board cellular uplink . As a third such example the individual may utilize a second device comprising an output component e.g. a wristwatch that interacts with the device and provides tactile feedback and the device may interact with the individual supplemental to the displaying of information on the window by sending the travel information to the second device for presentation by the output component to the individual .

As a third variation of this second aspect the techniques may involve the presentation of the visuals comprising the user interface on many types of windows . As a first such example the window may comprise a window mounted in the vehicle such as a windshield or porthole. As a second such example the window may comprise eyewear worn by the individual while operating the vehicle such as a pair of glasses or goggles. Additionally the visuals may be displayed on the window in various ways such as a projector device configured to project the visuals onto the window or a liquid crystal display integrated with the window .

As a fourth variation of this second aspect many types of output devices may be included to supplement the displaying of visuals on the window . For example such output devices may include speakers configured to generate voice or sound output visual output presented on a second display component not involving the window such as light emitting diodes LEDs and or liquid crystal displays LCDs integrated with a dash or console of the vehicle or a second device tactile feedback such as audible or tangible click mechanisms on dials in response to manipulation and vibration or heat feedback.

As a fifth variation of this second aspect the techniques may involve the receipt of user input received through many types of input devices .

As a first example of this fifth variation the user input may comprise voice input and the input device may comprise a microphone coupled with a speech recognizer that receives voice commands from the individual .

As a second example of this fourth variation the user input may comprise manipulation of a physical control and the input device may comprise a button switch dial or pedal that is positioned within the vehicle near a hand or foot of the individual .

As a third example of this fifth variation the user input may comprise touch input and the input device may comprise a touch sensitive display that detects contact from a fingertip of the individual .

As a fourth example of this fifth variation the user input may comprise one or more gestures performed by the individual e.g. hand signals pointing with a finger or sign language and the input device may comprise a gesture detector that is configured to monitor the individual to detect gestures and upon detecting a gesture translate the gesture into user input associated with the selected visual. For example the gesture detector may comprise a camera coupled with a machine vision algorithm and or at least one accelerometer worn on an appendage of the individual e.g. a wristwatch and configured to monitor acceleration of the accelerometer to detect the gesture of the appendage of the individual .

As a fifth example of this fifth variation the user input may comprise eye gaze of the individual involving a gaze position through the window and the input device may comprise a gaze detector configured to monitor the eye gaze of the individual and upon detecting a gaze position through the window translate the gaze position into user input associated with the selected visual. Additionally the eye gaze of the individual further comprising a focal depth e.g. detected according to the distance between the pupils of the individual s eyes where shorter distances indicate a closer focal depth and longer distances indicate a more distant focal depth and the gaze detector may be further configured to monitor the focal depth of the eye gaze of the individual and upon detecting the focal depth of the eye gaze on the window translate the gaze position into user input associated with the selected visual. That is the gaze detector may only correlate the gaze of the individual with user input if the focal depth of the individual s eye gaze is approximately focused on the visual presented on the window .

As a sixth variation of this fifth aspect user input may be directed by the user at a second computing device such as a mobile phone tablet laptop or wearable computer or an input device attached thereto such as a keyboard or mouse and may be transmitted to the device by the second computing device.

As a seventh variation of this fifth aspect the device may interact with a second device of the individual to receive user input and may handle such user input differently depending on the input device through which the user input was received. For example as illustrated in the exemplary scenario of the user interface may utilize the gaze of the individual to detect a selection of visuals on the window but may treat such selection as provisional until receiving an activation of a button.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein relates to the presentation of the visuals comprising the window oriented user interface and the interaction of the individual with the user interface presented on the window .

As a first variation of this third aspect the visuals may or may not relate to objects that are currently viewable through the window .

As a first example of this first variation at least one travel visual may be associated with an object that is viewable through the window at an object position and the visual may be displayed on the window at a visual position related to the object position of the object e.g. above below or pointing to the object .

As a second example of this first variation the visual may be displayed on the window at a visual position that is aligned with the visual with the object viewable through the window such as a highlight applied to the object viewable through the window .

As a third example of this first variation at least one visual may be associated with an object that is not viewable through the window such as a traffic control signal e.g. a street sign stop sign or traffic light that is missing defective or currently obscured by another vehicle or a road hazard. This visual may therefore fill in significant missing detail that may promote the safety and information of the operation of the vehicle by the individual .

As a fourth example of this first variation at least one visual may be displayed peripherally on the window . For example the window may present to the individual a primary viewing area associated with operation of the vehicle by the individual e.g. a forward view of the road ahead the other vehicles near the vehicle and traffic control signs and also a peripheral viewing area that is not associated with operation of the vehicle by the individual e.g. an upper portion of the window through which only the sky is typically viewable and the device may display at least one visual in the peripheral viewing area of the window . Such peripherally displayed visuals may be positioned adjacent to and may point toward relevant information viewable in the primary viewing area and or may simply be presented at an edge of the window . Additionally different types of information may be presented at different locations on the window e.g. urgent travel information relating to objects viewable in the primary viewing area of the window may be presented as visuals in the primary viewing area of the window while less urgent travel information and information that does not relate to objects viewable in the primary viewing area of the window such as fuel status may be presented in the peripheral viewing area of the window . For example in the exemplary scenario of routing instructions are presented in the upper peripheral portion of the window but may point to objects such as roads viewable in the primary viewing area and viewable objects related to the travel information such as roads involved in a travel route may be applied by visuals presented in the primary viewing area.

As a second variation of this third aspect the user input of the individual may be transmitted to the travel service e.g. as a recording of the travel of the individual and or to verify update correct and or supplement the travel information provided by the travel service . For example the user input from the individual may describe one or more travel region properties of the travel region of the individual and the device may be further configured to send the at travel region properties to the travel service .
