A handle disclosed in Patent Document 1 has been known as a handle including a decorative cover attached to a surface portion of a handle body. In this conventional example attachment of an elastic decorative plate or the decorative cover to a pull handle body or a handle body is accomplished by inserting both ends of the decorative plate into engagement lateral holes of the handle body while largely warping the overall decorative plate.

However the above mentioned conventional example has the problem of being prone to cause a fracture in the decorative cover a break in a surface treatment layer such as plating given to a surface of the decorative cover or the like because the overall decorative cover needs to be warped largely.

The present invention has been made in order to eliminate the foregoing drawback. An object of the present invention is to provide a vehicular handle having good characteristics in attachment of a decorative cover and also eliminating the likelihood of the occurrence of a failure in the attachment.

According to the present invention the above object is attained by providing a vehicular handle including a handle body attached to a vehicle and a decorative cover including a main body portion which is long in a longitudinal direction of the handle body and locking portions formed on both ends of the main body portion the decorative cover attached to a surface of the handle body with the locking portions locked to the handle body in which the decorative cover is attached by turning the main body portion with the one locking portion acting as a turning fulcrum and thereby resiliently locking the other locking portion to the handle body .

In the present invention attachment of the decorative cover is accomplished by turning the main body portion around the locking portion formed on one end of the main body portion with the locking portion locked to the handle body and locking the locking portion formed on the other end of the main body portion to a locked portion of the handle body by thus turning the main body portion .

In a case of using a process in which the overall decorative cover is temporarily warped for attachment to the handle body the amount of warping required for locking cannot be determined beforehand and thus the decorative cover may be excessively warped and hence suffer damage or the like however use of a mounting method in which the other end portion is locked with the turning operation performed with the one end acting as the turning fulcrum allows an assembly operator to perform the operation without excessively deforming the decorative cover thus enabling an improvement in assembly efficiency and moreover reducing the likelihood of the occurrence of a failure.

Also the vehicular handle may be configured as the vehicular handle including an electronic component fixed to the handle body in which the electronic component is provided with a movement restraining portion which restrains movement of at least one of the locking portions of the decorative cover .

In the present invention in which movement of the decorative cover locked to the handle body is finally restrained by the movement restraining portion formed on the electronic component high mounting strength can be achieved even if a locking dimension is set small. As a result the amount of warping of the decorative cover for resilient locking can be reduced and thus the decorative cover can be prevented from becoming harmfully deformed or damaged due to an excessively high load on the decorative cover during the resilient locking and moreover the decorative cover can be prevented with reliability from being carelessly removed or mischievously or otherwise removed.

Also the movement restraining portion may be configured to restrain turning movement of the decorative cover by constraining a turning fulcrum end of the decorative cover . Thereby if an attempt is made to displace the locking portion on the turning tip end side toward the turning fulcrum to unlock the locking portion the decorative cover is restrained from turning by the movement restraining portion thus rendering it difficult to perform unlocking by turning the decorative cover . As a result the unlocking requires an operating force sufficient to cause buckling deformation in the decorative cover which in turn renders it difficult to mischievously or otherwise perform improper unlocking operation.

Locking of the locking portions to the locked portions can also be accomplished by any of the locking portions and the locked portions undergoing elastic deformation to shift to their locked position however when warping of the main body portion is utilized for a shift to the locked position the decorative cover is long and thus the amount of displacement of the locked portion can be large even if the amount of warping of each portion is small and therefore locking operation can be performed without causing the occurrence of an excessively high stress on each portion.

In this case the vehicular handle may be configured as the vehicular handle in which at least one of the locking portion on the turning tip end side and the locked portion formed on the handle body and locked by the locking portion is formed to have an inclined surface producing a component force in a direction of warping of the main body portion when the locking portion is pressed into the locked portion . Thereby attachment operation is accomplished merely by turning the main body portion and then pressing the other locking portion toward the handle body and thus attachment workability is improved.

According to the present invention it is possible to achieve good characteristics in attachment of a decorative cover and also eliminate the likelihood of the occurrence of a failure in the attachment.

The handle includes a handle body a decorative cover for decorating a surface of the handle body and an electronic component fixed to the handle body .

The handle body is formed in a hollow shape by linking an upper side cover to an underside cover . Linkage of the upper side cover to the underside cover is accomplished by locking an insertion piece formed in a rear end portion of the underside cover to the upper side cover and screwing a fixing piece of a front end portion into an embedded nut of the upper side cover . Hereinafter for explanation of positions the left hand part of will be described as front and the upper part of Part b of will be described as upper side. Incidentally in Part b of reference numeral denotes a fixing screw screwed into the embedded nut.

In the embodiment an antenna unit A and a push switch B are incorporated as the electronic component and are led out of the handle body via a lead wire not illustrated and then connected to a control device such as a vehicle mounted computer mounted on the vehicle.

As illustrated in Part b of the push switch B is formed by accommodating a contact point portion not illustrated in a switch case and is configured as what is called a push button switch which connects or disconnects the contact point portion by press down operation of a push button attached to a head portion. The switch case is provided with a positioning protrusion and is positioned at a predetermined position by fitting the positioning protrusion to the upper side cover .

The push switch B is used as a lock button specifically when the push switch B is operated by being pressed down the control device communicates with a portable type electronic key carried by a user via an antenna to be described later to obtain authentication code outputted by the portable type electronic key and the door is switched to its locked state if the obtained authentication code is authenticated.

Also the antenna unit A includes an electrode of an electrostatic sensor and the antenna and is fixed at a predetermined position in such a way as to be sandwiched in between the underside cover and the upper side cover . The electrostatic sensor can detect the user gripping the handle body specifically when the electrostatic sensor senses the user s gripping motion a procedure for obtaining the authentication code is performed in the same manner as the above mentioned push switch B and the door is switched to its unlocked state if the obtained authentication code is authenticated.

As illustrated in the decorative cover is made of a material excellent in elasticity such as a synthetic resin and is formed with its length dimension in a longitudinal direction of the handle body and a surface of the upper side cover is provided with a fitting recess portion for fitting the decorative cover . Also switch openings for exposing the push button of the above mentioned push switch B are formed in the decorative cover and the upper side cover .

As illustrated in the decorative cover has a cross sectional configuration having the shape of a flat plate extending from the front end portion to an intermediate portion and gradually assuming a V shape extending from the intermediate portion to the rear end portion and likewise a surface of the fitting recess portion of the above described handle body is formed in a shape raised in a central portion above a flat surface extending from the intermediate portion to the rear end portion.

End portions of a main body portion of the decorative cover formed as described above are provided with locking portions respectively. As illustrated in the locking portion arranged in the rear end portion is formed in a hook shape and is provided with a locking piece protruding rearward and a pair of the locking portions are arranged in side edge portions. As illustrated in a locked portion to which the locking pieces are lockable is formed on the upper side cover and as illustrated in Part b of the main body portion can be turned around the locking portion by locking the locking pieces to the locked portion .

Further as illustrated in the locking portion arranged in the front end portion of the above described decorative cover is formed in a hook shape and is provided with a locking piece protruding frontward from a support post portion . An inclined surface is formed on a tip end of the locking portion and the inclined surface produces a component force in a buckling direction of the main body portion when receiving a reaction force that a projecting piece applies against a force to bring the inclined surface into pressure contact with the projecting piece of the locked portion to be described later.

Also the locking portion is divided into three regions in a width direction by the support post portion extending frontward in the central portion and has a small dimension of locking by the locking piece of the locking portion in the central portion.

Meanwhile the upper side cover is provided with the locked portion for adaptation to the locking portion in the front end portion of the above described decorative cover . As illustrated in the locked portion is formed by the plate shaped projecting piece protruding rearward. In the projecting piece a projecting dimension is set short in the central portion and long at its ends for adaptation to the locking portion of the decorative cover .

In the embodiment therefore as illustrated in Part b of attachment of the decorative cover is performed by turning the main body portion counterclockwise around a locking location with the locking piece of the locking portion on the rear end side locked and the inclined surface formed on the locking portion in the front end portion abuts against the locked portion of the upper side cover by turning of the main body portion .

In this state when a pressing operation force F is applied to a tip end portion of the main body portion a component force P in the buckling direction is produced in the main body portion by the action of the inclined surface as illustrated in Part b of . By the component force P the curvedly formed main body portion is slightly and elastically warped in a direction in which the curvature of a curve becomes small the locking portion extends over and beyond the projecting piece and then the locking portion is locked to the locked portion by elastic recovery of the main body portion .

Further in order to increase linkage strength of the decorative cover movement of the locking portion is restrained by a movement restraining portion as illustrated in Part a of . In the embodiment by utilizing the assembly of the decorative cover after the linkage thereof to the upper side cover the movement restraining portion is formed in the switch case of the push switch B thereby to restrain a frontward movement of the locking portion on the rear end side.

Arrangement of the movement restraining portion prevents the locking portion from moving frontward and being unlocked and thus improves the linkage strength even if the locking portion in the rear end portion is mischievously loaded by a frontward force. Also the movement restraining portion restrains the locking portion from moving in a direction of turning and therefore even if the locking portion on the front end side is loaded by a force which may move the locking portion rearward the overall decorative cover is restrained from turning around a portion of locking of the locking portion on the rear end side to the locked portion thus rendering it difficult to remove the decorative cover .
