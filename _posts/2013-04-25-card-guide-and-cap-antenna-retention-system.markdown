title: Card guide and cap antenna retention system
abstract: Embodiments of the present invention relate to a structure and method for providing better antenna element retention in the any environment. The structure may comprise at least two card guides attached to a base. Each card guide may have at least one antenna slot, and individual antenna elements may be guided into position by an antenna slot of two different card guides. The individual antenna elements may have their freedom of motion restricted in the direction of their insertion by caps attached to the card guides. The individual antenna elements may have their freedom of motion restricted in a direction transverse to their direction of insertion by retention members attached to the card guides. By allowing for the “top-down” assembly of individual antenna elements in a modular fashion, embodiments of the present invention may facilitate easier repair of antenna element arrays, than prior art array assemblies.

The present invention is related to and claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent application No. 61 670 252 filed on Jul. 11 2012 and entitled Card Guide And Cap Antenna Retention System .

This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. FA8620 06 G 4028 0008 awarded by the United States Department of the Air Force. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to phased antenna arrays and more particularly to a structure and method for providing better antenna element retention in the array environment.

Antenna elements are often arranged in arrays in which they are attached to a ground plate. Narrow antenna elements also known as card elements like the Vivaldi Notch do not lend themselves to a maintainable modular array assembly. The arrays built from narrow elements are often fabricated or printed in sheets. In order to maintain array geometry which is key to array performance the sheets are inseparably attached to one another via a notch. This means that if one antenna element fails the entire sheet must be removed in order to perform maintenance. Additionally current arrays have cumbersome two sided assembly requirements and a high fabrication risk due to high component cost.

A need therefore exists for a structure that allows for a more effective assembly of antenna element arrays.

When building an antenna array maintaining antenna element spacing and support are key to array performance. There is a need to support antenna elements in a lattice array over a large area while still controlling the mechanical response of the array when subjected to adverse mechanical loads. The present invention accomplishes this goal by providing support and alignment for antenna elements that require precise array placement and mechanical load bearing under adverse shock and vibration conditions.

Additionally unlike the sheet assemblies of the prior art the present invention allows arrays to be built in a modular fashion using individual antenna elements. This modular assembly capability can reduce the size requirements for thin antenna elements and permit them to be fabricated singularly. Additionally in one embodiment modular assembly will permit array assembly to take place along a single line of action from a single orientation top down assembly . This may allow for easier repair and less manipulation of the array because an individual element can be removed rather than having to remove an entire sheet.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate the top down modular assembly afforded by an embodiment of the present invention because it maintains array geometry and controls its response to adverse mechanical loads while facilitating easy repair with less manipulation.

Referring now to the drawings shows an antenna element array assembly in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The assembly may have at least two card guides that are attached to a base . For example the attachment may be done via screws or other attachment techniques known in the industry. Individual antenna elements are guided into position by antenna slots located on the card guides as shown in . The individual antenna elements may have their freedom of motion restricted in the direction of their insertion by a cap that may be attached to each of the card guides . The individual antenna elements may have their freedom of motion restricted in a direction transverse to the direction of their insertion by retention members attached to the card guides as shown in in one embodiment both the card guides and the caps are made of a non metallic material. The assembly of allows for individual antenna elements to be assembled in a modular fashion along a single line of action from a single orientation top down assembly .

If an individual antenna element needs to be removed an embodiment of the present invention provides an easy solution. After the caps holding the element in place are removed just the individual element for which removal is required can be slid out of the antenna slots while all other antenna elements remain in place. Subsequently either a new or a repaired element can be slid back into the antenna slots and held in place with either the same caps or new ones.

In an embodiment of the present invention adjustments can be made to the various components card guides caps and retention members to tune the mechanical compliance of the antenna element array to accommodate various mechanical shock and vibration environments.

While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating there from. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation or the appended claims.
