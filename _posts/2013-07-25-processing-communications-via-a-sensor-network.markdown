title: Processing communications via a sensor network
abstract: A first device may receive provisioning information for a second device; establish a tunnel with the second device within a first network based on receiving the provisioning information; provide the provisioning information to the second device to cause the second device to gather or process data within the first network; and receive a command instruction from a user device via a second network. The command instruction may relate to the data gathered or processed by the second device. The first network may be separate from the second network. The first device may communicate with the second device within the first network and independently of the second network to process the command instruction; form a response to the command instruction based on processing the command instruction; and provide the response to the command instruction towards the user device.

Sensor devices are sometimes used to gather data and provide the data via a service provider network e.g. a cellular network . Users sometimes communicate with the sensor devices e.g. using user devices via the service provider network to receive data gathered by the sensor devices e.g. to process the data to use the data to aid in analysis or for some other purpose . Processing communications between the user devices and the sensor devices imposes network load on the service provider network thereby increasing costs and increasing the risk for outages and or failures.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

Systems and or methods as described herein may reduce network load on a service provider network e.g. a cellular network by processing a command instruction via a local sensor network referred to herein after as a sensor network . That is the command instruction may be processed independently of the service provider network thereby reducing network load on the service provider network. In some implementations the command instruction may correspond to a request for data gathered by one or more sensor devices in the sensor network an instruction to direct the one or more sensor devices to perform a task e.g. adjust a configuration or orientation of a sensor cause the sensor to gather and or transmit data at particular times capture an image capture audio and or perform some other task or some other type of instruction relating to data gathered by the one or more sensor devices.

In some implementations each app device may be associated with a particular application to process data gathered by particular sensor devices. As an example app device 1 may process temperature measurements gathered by sensor device 1 and or sensor device 2 to identify an average temperature over a particular amount of time and to identify when a temperature measurement exceeds a predetermined threshold. In some implementations an app device may send a control instruction to a sensor device. As an example the app device may send a control instruction to cause the sensor device to capture an image via a camera associated with the sensor device. As described in greater detail below other examples of processing data and providing instructions to sensor devices are possible.

In some implementations an aggregator server may be associated with multiple app devices to process a command instruction involving multiple sensor devices and multiple app devices.

Referring to a user device may provide a command instruction to a central app device. The central app device may provide the command instruction via a service provider network to a particular aggregator server e.g. aggregator server 1 . Alternatively the user device may provide the command instruction directly to aggregator server 1. In some implementations aggregator server 1 may process the command instruction independently of the service provider network. For example the command instruction may be processed via the sensor network thereby reducing network load on the service provider network.

As an example the command instruction may include an instruction to capture an image e.g. using sensor device 1 associated with app device 1 when an object is detected e.g. when the object is detected by sensor device 2 associated with app device 2 . In some implementations aggregator server 1 may communicate with app device 2 to receive an indication that the object has been detected by sensor device 2 and may communicate with app device 1 to direct sensor device 1 to capture an image. As described below other examples of processing a command instruction are possible from the example described with respect to .

In some implementations communications between sensor device 1 app device 1 sensor device 2 app device 2 and aggregator server 1 e.g. to process the command instruction may occur within the sensor network thereby reducing network load of the service provider network while allowing the user device to provide the command instruction via the service provider network. Also processing communications within the sensor network may prevent the need for the sensor devices and or the app devices to communicate via the service provider network thereby reducing labor and or other costs associated with establishing maintaining connections between the sensor devices the app devices and the service provider network. For example the connections to the service provider network may be associated with bearers having higher quality of service QoS requirements than needed to process communications between the sensor devices the app devices and or the aggregator devices.

In some implementations app devices may receive provisioning information for multiple sensor devices such that when a sensor device connects to the sensor network the sensor device may be provisioned by an associated app device e.g. receive and execute instructions that identify how data is to be gathered by the sensor device thereby allowing multiple sensor devices to be concurrently provisioned. Further aggregator servers may receive provisioning information for multiple app devices such that when an app device connects to the sensor network the app device may be provisioned e.g. receive and execute instructions that identify how data is to be processed by the app device thereby allowing multiple app devices to be concurrently provisioned.

In some implementations aggregator server may establish the tunnel and provide the provisioning information for sensor device and for app device when app device connects to sensor network e.g. when app device is to be added to sensor network . In some implementations aggregator server may encrypt the provisioning information and may provide the provisioning information via a secure channel to prevent an unauthorized device from receiving the provisioning information.

In some implementations communications between app device and aggregator server e.g. communications relating to provisioning app device may occur via sensor network thereby reducing network load on service provider network .

Process may further include processing the command instruction block . For example aggregator server may process the command instruction based on receiving the command instruction and authorizing user device . In some implementations aggregator server may identify one or more particular app devices and or sensor devices that may be involved in processing the command instruction.

As an example assume that the command instruction includes a request for data records meeting particular criteria. Given this assumption aggregator server may identify data records formed by one or more sensor devices and or processed by one or more app devices meeting the particular criteria in the command instruction. For example aggregator server may receive data records from sensor devices and or app devices e.g. via tunnels between sensor devices app devices and aggregator servers connected to sensor network store the data records and identify the data records that meet the criteria. In some implementations aggregator server may request the data records based on receiving the command instruction.

Additionally or alternatively aggregator server may receive and store data records from sensor devices and or app devices without receiving the command instruction and may look up data records meeting the criteria when receiving the command instruction. In some implementations identified data records may include a report of data records meeting the criteria and or an alert when sensor device gathers a data record that meets the criteria and or when app device processes a data record that meets the criteria. In some implementations the identified data records may aid in analysis such as a sales trend analysis e.g. to identify targeted content for a user a temperature trend analysis a failure analysis and or some other type of analysis .

As another example assume that the command instruction includes a control instruction for sensor device . Given this assumption aggregator server may provide the control instruction to sensor device via app device . For example aggregator server may provide the control instruction to app device via one or more tunnels connecting aggregator server and app device e.g. based on information stored by data structure . In some implementations app device may provide the control instruction to sensor device via one or more tunnels connecting app device to sensor device .

As another example assume that the command instruction includes an update to provisioning information for sensor device and or app device . Given this assumption aggregator server may provide the update to the provisioning information to app device . For example aggregator server may provide the update to the provisioning information to app device via one or more tunnels connecting aggregator server and app device e.g. based on information stored by data structure . In some implementations app device may provide the update to the provisioning information to sensor device via one or more tunnels connecting app device to sensor device .

In some implementations aggregator server may form a response to the command instruction based on processing the command instruction. For example the response may include data records meeting particular criteria e.g. when the command instruction includes a request for data meeting the particular criteria . In some implementations the response may correspond to a one time request for data records meeting particular criteria a recurring request for data records meeting particular criteria and or data records associated with an alarm. In some implementations e.g. when the command instruction includes a control instruction the response may include an indication that sensor device and or app device has received and or executed the control instruction. In some implementations the response may include some other information corresponding to a response to the command instruction.

In some implementations communications between sensor device app device and or aggregator server e.g. communications relating to processing the command instruction may occur within sensor network thereby reducing load on service provider network .

Process may also include providing the response block . For example aggregator server may provide the data to user device e.g. via central app device based on processing the command instruction and forming the response. In some implementations aggregator server may encrypt the data and may provide the data via a secure channel to prevent an unauthorized device from receiving the response.

While shows process as including a particular quantity and arrangement of blocks in some implementations process may include fewer blocks additional blocks or a different arrangement of blocks. Additionally or alternatively some of the blocks may be performed in parallel. Also in some implementations one or more of the blocks may be omitted.

In some implementations aggregator server may receive and or store data records formed by sensor device and sensor device . Further aggregator server may receive and or store processed data records formed by app device and app device . Also aggregator server may connect with sensor device sensor device app device and or app device via sensor network to process the command instruction. As a result the command instruction may be processed within sensor network thereby reducing load on service provider network . Further sensor device sensor device app device app device and or central app device may not be directly accessible by user device thereby increasing security while still permitting user device to transmit receive data relating to a command instruction.

While a particular example is shown in the above description is merely an example implementation. In practice other examples are possible from what is described above in .

Further assume that sensor device is oriented to detect when a vehicle parks in a parking space and that sensor device is oriented to capture an image of the vehicle. Given these assumptions aggregator server may process the command instruction by directing app device to provide aggregator server with an indication that a vehicle has been detected and directing app device to capture an image e.g. using sensor device when aggregator server receives the indication.

In some implementations app device may detect the vehicle based on data received from sensor device . For example sensor device may include a video camera a metal detection sensor a carbon monoxide sensor an RFID sensor that identifies the presence of an object when the object emits an RFID signal a scale and or some other type of sensor that gathers data relating to object detection.

As an example app device may detect the vehicle when receiving video from sensor device and determining that the vehicle enters the field of view of sensor device e.g. based on pixel based identification technology that identifies objects such as the shape of the vehicle or the license plate of the vehicle based on pixel patterns in a video or image . As another example app device may detect the vehicle when receiving a measurement of weight from sensor device that indicates that the vehicle has parked in the parking space. In some implementations app device may provide the indication that the vehicle has been detected to aggregator server and aggregator server may direct app device to capture an image of the vehicle using sensor device .

In some implementations aggregator server may receive the captured image and may provide the captured image to a display device as shown in interface . In some implementations aggregator server may provide some other content to the display device e.g. targeted content based on the license plate of the vehicle as identified by the captured image . In some implementations the display device may be located in a different location than what is shown and my display content relating to parking availability in a parking facility and or parking rates that may be based on parking availability.

As shown in the communications between sensor device sensor device app device and app device to process the command instruction may occur within sensor network while the command instruction may be received via service provider network . Also the command instruction may be processed with lower latency within sensor network than if the command instruction were to be processed via service provider network thereby improving the performance of a time sensitive application e.g. when an image is to be captured of an object that may be moving .

While a particular example is shown in the above description is merely an example implementation. In practice other examples are possible from what is described above in . For example aggregator server may perform some other task based on receiving the captured image or based on receiving the indication of the detected vehicle. In some implementations the command instruction may include some other instruction than what is described. For example the command instruction may direct aggregator server to provide an alert when app device detects a vehicle intrusion e.g. based on audio corresponding to an intrusion received by sensor device based on pixel based analysis of an image that identifies an intrusion event such as broken glass etc. .

Given these assumptions aggregator server may process the command instruction by providing a data request to app device to provide an alert to aggregator server when app device identifies that the resource level has dropped below the particular threshold. Further aggregator server may provide a data request to app device to provide an alert to aggregator server when app device identifies that the temperature of the resource has exceeded the particular threshold. Further aggregator server may provide an alert to user device when aggregator server receives the alerts from app device and app device . As shown in the communications between sensor device sensor device app device and app device to process the command instruction may occur within sensor network .

While a particular example is shown in the above description is merely an example implementation. In practice other examples are possible from what is described above in . For example the command instruction may direct app device and or sensor device to trigger a switch actuator e.g. to trigger an alarm activate deactivate a device etc. capture an image of a vehicle license plate adjust a sensor and or metering device or perform some other task based on the occurrence of an event as identified by sensor device and or app device e.g. the detection of an object the detection of a measurement associated with data record exceeding or dropping below a threshold the detection of a facility intrusion the detection of fire smoke carbon monoxide and or the detection of some other event by sensor device and or app device .

As described above app devices may receive provisioning information for sensor devices such that when sensor devices connect to sensor network sensor devices may be concurrently provisioned e.g. receive and execute instructions that identify how data is to be gathered by sensor devices . Further aggregator servers may receive provisioning information for multiple app devices such that when app devices connect to sensor network app devices may be concurrently provisioned.

In some implementations the provisioning information for sensor devices and or app devices may be customized for particular classes of data flows associated with sensor device and or app devices and may include fewer and or less complex provisioning instructions than if sensor devices and or app devices were to communicate via service provider network .

In some implementations communications between sensor devices app devices and or aggregator servers e.g. communications relating to processing a command instruction may occur within sensor network thereby reducing load on service provider network while allowing user device to provide the command instruction and receive a response to the command instruction via the service provider network. Also processing the command instruction within sensor network may prevent the need for sensor devices and or app devices to communicate via service provider network thereby reducing labor and or other costs associated with establishing maintaining connections between sensor devices app devices and service provider network . For example the connections to service provider network may be associated with bearers having higher QoS requirements than needed to process communications between sensor devices app devices and or aggregator servers . Additionally or alternatively the connections to service provider network may include multiple channels and or services that may not be needed by sensor devices and or app devices e.g. voice call channels services video delivery channels services etc. .

While implementations described herein describe processing a command instruction within sensor network in practice some communications for processing the command instruction may occur outside sensor network e.g. as a redundancy when sensor network is unavailable and or when a particular sensor device app device and or aggregator server is unavailable to communicate via sensor network .
