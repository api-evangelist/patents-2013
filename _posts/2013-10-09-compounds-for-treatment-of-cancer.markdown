The present invention relates to novel compounds having anti cancer activity compositions comprising the same and their use for treating various forms of cancer.

Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States exceeded only by heart disease. In the United States cancer accounts for 1 of every 4 deaths. The 5 year relative survival rate for all cancers patients diagnosed in 1996 2003 is 66 up from 50 in 1975 1977 American Cancer Society Atlanta Ga. 2008 . This improvement in survival reflects progress in diagnosing at an earlier stage and improvements in treatment. Discovering highly effective anticancer agents with low toxicity is a primary goal of cancer research.

2 Aryl thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid amides ATCAA have been described as potent cytotoxic agents for both prostate cancer and melanoma Li et al.

The most potent of the 2 aryl thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid amides could inhibit prostate cancer cells with an average ICin the range from 0.7 to 1.0 M and average ICvalues against melanoma cells were 1.8 2.6 M Li et al. Synthesis and Antiproliferative Activity of Thiazolidine Analogs for Melanoma 17 4113 7 2007 . One preferred compound 2RS 4R 2 phenyl thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid hexadecylamide was sent to the United States National Cancer Institute 60 human tumor cell line anticancer drug screen NCI 60 . Results from NCI 60 assay showed that this compound could inhibit growth of all nine types of cancer cells with ICvalues in the range from 0.124 M Leukemia CCRF CEM to 3.81 M Non Small Cell Lung Cancer NCI H522 . Further improvement in anti cancer activity of these compounds in terms of their ICvalues would be desirable.

A further aspect of the present invention relates to a method of making the compounds according to formula I . Furthermore the present invention discloses synthetic methodologies for the preparation of amide alkoxyamides ketone hydrazine and oxime derivatives of thiazolidines thiazolines thiazoles imidazolines imidazoles oxazolidines oxazolines and oxazoles.

To synthesize thiazoline and thiazole series compounds L or D cysteine can be reacted with substituted or unsubstituted benzonitrile in methanol and pH 6.4 phosphate buffer solution at ambient temperature for several days Bergeron et al. Evaluation of Desferrithiocin and its Synthetic Analogs as Orally Effective Iron Chelators 34 2072 8 1991 Bergeron et al. Desazadesmethyldesferrithiocin Analogues as Orally Effective Iron Chelators 42 95 108 1999 Zamri et al. An Improved Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Pyochelin Siderophore of and 56 249 256 2000 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . The resulting carboxylic acid intermediates can be easily converted to corresponding Weinreb amides Nahm et al. N Methoxy N methylamides as Effective Acylating Agents 22 3815 18 1981 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety using EDCI HOBt as coupling reagents. Thiazole intermediates can be obtained from BrCCl DBU dehydrogenation of the Weinreb amides. The thiazole intermediates can be reacted with appropriate lithium reagents or Grignard reagents i.e. bearing the corresponding C ring see Scheme 3 infra in anhydrous THF to give the final thiazoles Nahm et al. N Methoxy N methylamides as Effective Acylating Agents 22 3815 18 1981 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . Alternatively the thiazoline Weinreb amides can be reacted directly with appropriate lithium reagents or Grignard reagents after quenching with saturated NHCl solution which affords mixtures of thiazoline compounds and the corresponding thiazole compounds.

When thiazoline thiazole mixtures were placed in the solvent and exposed to air under ambient atmosphere for some time overnight to several days the thiazoline ring spontaneously dehydrogenated to thiazoles. As an example in solution with deuterated chloroform mixtures of thiazoline thiazole compounds can be slowly converted to almost pure thiazole compounds after roughly 9 days see e.g. .

Formation of thiazolidine compounds is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 307 093 to Miller et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7 662 842 to Miller et al. each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Oxazoline derivatives carboxylic acids carboxamides methanones according to the present invention are prepared via condensation of imine derivatives benzonitrile and 1 phenyl 2 methoxy ethanimine with enantioneric L or D or racemic cysteine or serine ester while using triethylamine as a base Meyer et al. Asymmetry 14 2229 2238 2003 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Syntheses of thiazole oxazole and imidazole can be carried out by dehydrogenation of corresponding thiazoline oxazoline and imidazoline. Dehydrogenation according to the present invention can be achieved by initial halogenation of these core ring systems thiazoline imidazoline and oxazoline followed by elimination to yield the desired thiazole oxazole and imidazole derivatives.

Formation of thiocarbonyl linker group from carbonyl can be carried out using Lawesson s reagent Jesberger et al. 1929 1958 2003 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . The thioketone structure with conjugated aromatic rings is stable relative to unhindered thioketones.

The carbonyl linker group can also be reduced to an alcohol using Grignard reaction of an intermediate aldehyde with according Grignard reagents. Alternatively the carbonyl group can be completely removed with Clemmensen reduction to form the corresponding hydrocarbon e.g. methylene group . When carbonyl is reduced to an alcohol or methylene the strong hydrogen acceptor C O reverses to strong hydrogen donor O H or hydrocarbon which totally loses hydrogen bond effects.

The ester and carboxamide linkages can be prepared from the same intermediate acids used to form the ketone linkage except that the reactants acid and C ring precursor are exposed to suitable conditions for formation of the respective ester DCC NMM or amide EDCl HOBt EtN linkages. Carboxamide linkages are also taught in U.S. Pat. No. 7 307 093 to Miller et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7 662 842 to Miller et al. each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In one embodiment metastatic cancer refers to a cancer that spread metastasized from its original site to another area of the body. Virtually all cancers have the potential to spread. Whether metastases develop depends on the complex interaction of many tumor cell factors including the type of cancer the degree of maturity differentiation of the tumor cells the location and how long the cancer has been present as well as other incompletely understood factors. Metastases spread in three ways by local extension from the tumor to the surrounding tissues through the bloodstream to distant sites or through the lymphatic system to neighboring or distant lymph nodes. Each kind of cancer may have a typical route of spread. The tumor is called by the primary site ex. breast cancer that has spread to the brain is called metastatic breast cancer to the brain .

In one embodiment drug resistant cancer refers to cancer cells that acquire resistance to chemotherapy. Cancer cells can acquire resistance to chemotherapy by a range of mechanisms including the mutation or overexpression of the drug target inactivation of the drug or elimination of the drug from the cell. Tumors that recur after an initial response to chemotherapy may be resistant to multiple drugs they are multidrug resistant . In the conventional view of drug resistance one or several cells in the tumor population acquire genetic changes that confer drug resistance. Accordingly the reasons for drug resistance inter alia are a some of the cells that are not killed by the chemotherapy mutate change and become resistant to the drug. Once they multiply there may be more resistant cells than cells that are sensitive to the chemotherapy b Gene amplification. A cancer cell may produce hundreds of copies of a particular gene. This gene triggers an overproduction of protein that renders the anticancer drug ineffective c cancer cells may pump the drug out of the cell as fast as it is going in using a molecule called p glycoprotein d cancer cells may stop taking in the drugs because the protein that transports the drug across the cell wall stops working e the cancer cells may learn how to repair the DNA breaks caused by some anti cancer drugs 0 cancer cells may develop a mechanism that inactivates the drug. One major contributor to multidrug resistance is overexpression of P glycoprotein P gp . This protein is a clinically important transporter protein belonging to the ATP binding cassette family of cell membrane transporters. It can pump substrates including anticancer drugs out of tumor cells through an ATP dependent mechanism. Thus the resistance to anticancer agents used in chemotherapy is the main cause of treatment failure in malignant disorders provoking tumors to become resistant. Drug resistance is the major cause of cancer chemotherapy failure.

Adjuvant therapy is given to prevent a possible cancer reoccurrence.

In one embodiment Radiotherapy refers to high energy x rays and similar rays such as electrons to treat disease. Many people with cancer will have radiotherapy as part of their treatment. This can be given either as external radiotherapy from outside the body using x rays or from within the body as internal radiotherapy.

Compound 8f was recrystallized from hexane and ethyl acetate and single colorless crystals suitable for X ray diffraction were obtained. X ray crystallographic data for 8f were collected from a single crystal mounted with paratone oil on a nylon cryoloop. Data were collected at 100K on a Bruker Proteum CCD area detector controlled by Proteum2 software Proteum2 Bruker AXS Inc. Madison Wis. USA 2005 using a rotating anode generator and Osmic minors to generate Cu radiation 1.54178A . The data were reduced using SAINT SAINT Bruker AXS Inc. Madison Wis. USA. 1998 with an absorption correction applied using SADABS SADABS Bruker AXS Inc. Madison Wis. USA. 2000 based on redundant reflections this correction included a spherical component. The structure was solved using direct methods SHELXS which revealed all of the heavy atoms. Structure refinement with SHELXL SHELXL 97 G. M. Sheldrick University of Gottingen Germany 1997 was carried out using full matrix methods based on F and proceeded smoothly. Hydrogen atoms were added to the structural model assuming ideal C H distances and isotropic ADPs constrained to be similar to that of the bonded carbon atom. In the final model anisotropic ADPs were refined for all heavy atoms and isotropic ADPs for chemically similar hydrogens e.g. methyl H were constrained to be identical. The final refinement parameters are wR2 0.084 for 228 parameters and 3066 independent observations R1 0.031 S goodness of fit 1.057.

An ORTEP drawing of 8f with the atom labeling scheme is shown in . The X ray structure showed that 8f molecule contained a conjugated system composed of three aromatic rings and a carbonyl group linker between B and C ring as expected A ring phenyl B ring thiazole C ring 3 4 5 trimethoxyphenyl . As a result two C C bonds adjacent to C O and C C bond between A phenyl and B thiazole ring display C1 C7 1.496 2 C7 C8 1.492 2 C10 C11 1.471 2 shorter bond lengths than normal C C single bond 1.54 and longer than normal C C double bond 1.34 see Table 1 below . Thus conjugation of the system is possible for A B C rings and carbonyl group. The carbonyl group is nearly coplanar with the adjacent B thiazole ring O C7 C1 C6 16.2 2 O C7 C8 C9 9.7 2 .

Modifications of the B ring from a thiazolidine to thiazole system and the linker from an amide to a ketone. In prior ATCAA compounds the thiazolidine ring which contained a free NH at its 3 position was shown to be important for cytotoxicity. Once the B ring thiazolidine moiety was replaced by a thiazoline ring the antiproliferative activity decreased sharply from 0.6 M to over 50 M on WM 164 cell lines Li et al. Synthesis and Antiproliferative Activity of Thiazolidine Analogs for Melanoma 17 4113 7 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . The ATCAA 1 fatty amide derivative that was most effective against melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines were examined and shown to have an IC0.4 2.2 M see Table 2 . Replacement of the long fatty chain with a certain aromatic bulky substituent such as fluorene ATCAA 2 showed inhibitory activity on both cancer cell lines IC 1.6 3.9 M . The fluorene group in 4 carboxylic amide position was also replaced by 3 4 5 trimethoxylphenyl group 2a and 2b but the potency against both cancer cell lines was lost. The subsequent B ring modification from saturated thiazolidine compound 2a to unsaturated thiazole 5 did not show any cytotoxicity against either cancer cell line tested. But thiazoline enantiomers 4a and 4b R isomer and S isomer with similar antiproliferative activities showed improved activity IC 3.4 38.3 M compared with 2a 2b and 5. When the amide CONH linkage between B ring and C ring was replaced by a carbonyl linker the mixtures of thiazoline thiazole ketone 8f were obtained instead of desired thiazoline ketone because the auto dehydrogenation between thiazoline and thiazole occurred the conversion was shown in . Surprisingly introduction of the carbonyl group linker and thiazole B ring led to a significant enhancement of growth inhibition of examined cancer cell lines with a low nanomolar level 8f IC 0.021 0.071 M that is comparable to the natural anticancer agent colchicine. Consequently a series of the related compounds with B as a thiazole ring were designed and synthesized based on the discovery of 8f. Their anticancer activity was also evaluated against melanoma and prostate cancer.

Modifications of the C ring also had significant effects. Variation of the phenyl substituents has a remarkable change in effect on potency. The in vitro assay results shown in Table 3 provide interesting results but only the 3 4 5 trimethoxylphenyl C ring 8f showed excellent inhibition against all cancer cells IC 21 71 nM average IC 41 nM . Compound 8g with a 3 5 dimethoxyphenyl group showed 6 fold average cytotoxicity lower than 8f against six different cell lines IC 170 424 nM calcd. average IC 261 nM . Modifications of 8f by removal of one methoxy at meta position 8e or two methoxy groups 8b 8c and 8d from 8f led to a dramatic loss in activity IC 20 M . Although ortho substituted monomethoxy compound 8d exhibited weak activity against a certain cell lines compared with meta para MeO substituted 8c 8b and dimethoxyphenyl compound 8e none of them showed significant potency in inhibition compared with 8f. Similar trends were also seen in 8h and 8j with 2 fluorophenyl and hexadecyl in C ring modifications.

Modifications of the A ring using different para substituted electron withdrawing groups EWG and electron donor groups EDG did not show clear influence on antiproliferative activity. Introduction of a weak EWG 4 F in 8n ICvalues 6 43 nM or weak EDG 4 CHin 8k ICs 5 21 nM both increased the potency compared with 8f see Table 4 . The replacement of para position with strong EWG such as NO 8p CN 8q CF 8t or introducing strong EDG 3 4 dimethoxy to A phenyl ring 8o exhibited comparable antiproliferative activity.

To compare the effects of ortho meta and para substitutions a fluoro atom was introduced to different positions of A phenyl ring 8l 8m and 8n . The various o m p substituents did not exhibit equal activities. p Fluoro substituted 8n has the best activity for examined prostate cancer cells 6 13 nM while o fluoro substituted 81 showed the lowest ICvalues 27 30 nM against melanoma cells. 8n has similar average ICvalues 33 43 nM against melanoma compared with 81. But o fluoro substituted 81 has lowest potency ICvalues 52 114 nM among the three substituted compounds on prostate cancer cells. Meta substituted compound 8m showed lowest activity on melanoma cells ICvalues 287 304 nM but showed moderate inhibition on prostate cancer cells ICvalues 23 46 nM .

Turning to the effects of steric hindrance group on the A phenyl ring substituents it was found that p bromo 8u ICvalues 18 44 nM caused a decrease in antiproliferative activity relative to p fluoro position 8n ICvalues 6 12 nM but only against prostate cancer cells. Reduced activity against both cancer cell lines occurred when p methyl 8k ICvalues 5 21 nM was replaced with a p ethyl group 8v ICvalues 17 70 nM .

To investigate if the phenyl ring played an essential role at the A ring site phenyl at 2 thiazole position was removed and compound 10 was obtained. This modification caused a total loss of activity compared with 8f. The replacement of the A ring by pyridine compound 8x had the same effect. Moreover substituting 2 pyrimidine in A ring compound 8y also caused a significant loss of activity ICs 11.8 41.0 M . However introducing the thiophene replacement of phenyl 8z into A position improved the potency calcd. 1 3 folds on all examined cell lines ICs 9 38 nM compared to 8f ICs 21 71 nM .

Because many of the compounds show poor water solubility three water soluble salts were prepared after introducing a hydrophilic group such as NH 8w and COOH 8r into A ring to form HCl or sodium salts. Another modification is replacing A C rings in 8a with pyridine 8l 8x 8y or pyrimidine rings which could also be converted into HCl salts. These modifications reduced the calculated Log P values Log P 2.74 3.90 compared with 8a and 8f Log P 4.46 and 4.08 . Introducing p amino to A phenyl 8w is the only case to increase the antiproliferative activity HCl salt ICvalues 11 29 nM compared with 8f against all cell lines. Although replacing phenyl with pyrimidine 8y kept partial activity against both cancer cells the potency range was markedly reduced from nM to M compared with 8f. Unfortunately introducing COOH to para phenyl A ring and pyridine to A or C rings 8l 8r 8x all resulted in the total loss of the anti cancer activity. A total loss of potency was seen in the methyl ester 8s of acid 8r against both cancer cell lines. Demethylation of compound 8f afforded water soluble 3 4 5 trihydroxyphenyl at C ring compound 11f but this demethylation results in complete loss of antiproliferative activity against all tested cancer cells which also points out the importance of 3 4 5 trimethoxyphenyl at C position of the methanones.

Given these results compound 8f was also subjected to in vitro testing in an NCI 60 screening assay which measures the ability of the compound to act against six leukemia cell lines eight non small cell lung cancer cell lines seven colon cancer cell lines six CNS cancer e.g. glioma glioblastoma cell lines eight melanoma cell lines six ovarian cancer cell lines seven renal cancer cell lines two prostate cancer cell lines and eight breast cancer cell lines. The results of the NCI 60 assay showed broad activity against all of these cancers with GIvalues in the nanomolar range

The activity of compound 31 was assessed by in vitro cytotoxicity assay as described in Example 4 above. It was determined that compound 31 exhibited enhanced activity against the PC 3 A375 and B16 cell lines.

To understand the target for these highly potent compounds cell cycle analysis was performed using compound 8f. LNCaP prostate cancer cells were exquisitely sensitive to compound 8f IC 29 nM . LNCaP cells were treated with compound 8f 10 to 500 nM for 24 h prior to staining with propidium iodide and performing cell cycle analysis. Although compound 8f had no effect on cell cycle distribution at a 10 nM below the IC the proportion of cells in G2 M phase increased in proportion to the concentration of compound 8f at higher concentrations. About 10 of untreated cells were observed in G2 M phase whereas the cells treated with more than 50 nM showed a greater proportion of cells in G2 M phase 57 63 and 49 respectively for 50 200 and 500 nM . The results are shown in . The increase in G2 M phase cells was accompanied by a decrease in G1 populations relative to control. These data indicate that compound 8f may inhibit tubulin action in a manner similar to paclitaxel the vinca alkaloids and cochicine Margolis et al. Addition of Colchicine Tubulin Complex to Microtubule Ends The Mechanism of Substoichiometric Colchicine Poisoning 74 3466 70 1977 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Based on these results an in vitro microtubule polymerization assay was performed.

The absorbance of wavelength at 340 nm was monitored every 60 s for 20 mM by the SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader Bio Tek Instruments Winooski Vt. . The spectrophotometer was set at 37 C. for tubulin polymerization. The ICvalue was defined as the concentration which can inhibit 50 of microtubule polymerization. The results are shown in . Compared with non treated control compound 8f inhibits tubulin polymerization. The effect of 8f on tubulin assembly was examined at concentrations from 0.625 M to 20 M. The observed results demonstrate that compound 8f inhibited tubulin polymerization in a dose dependent manner with an ICvalue of 4.23 M.

Human A375 malignant melanoma cells were plated at a colony forming density 200 cells per well on six well plates . Cells were grown in DMEM medium GIBCO Invitrogen Corp. Carlsbad Calif. supplemented with charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum HyClone Logan Utah and an antibiotic antimycotic solution Sigma St. Louis Mo. at 37 C in an atmosphere of 95 air and 5 CO. Cells were treated with compounds 8f and 8n at different concentrations 0 0.03 0.3 and 3 M . Cells were grown for 10 days and colonies were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 C. The fixed colonies were washed with distilled water stained with 0.1 crystalline blue for 30 min and rinsed with distilled water to remove excess of the dye. Plates were photographed and colony formations were examined by eye and under the microscope. Both of compounds 8f and 8n significantly inhibit melanoma colony formation at 0.03 M. At the two higher concentrations tested 0.3 and 3 M colony formations were completely inhibited with no colonies visible under the microscope .

The efficacy of compound 8n was assessed using B16 F1 mouse melanoma cells injected in C57 black mice. B16 tumors will grow in a fully immunocompetent host in which case the tumor progression may more accurately replicate melanoma growth. Logarithmic growth phase B16 F1 3.8 10 cells were injected s.c. into the right dorsal flank of C57BL 6 mice. When tumors were palpable mice were randomized into a control and a treatment group n 9 . Mice were dosed by daily i.p. injection with 30 l of vehicle control group or 8n solution treatment group 6 mg kg . Tumor volume was measured once daily with a Traceable electronic digital caliper and calculated by using the formula a b 0.5 where a and b represented the larger and smaller diameters respectively. Body weights were also recorded. Tumor volume was expressed as cubic millimeters. Data were expressed as Mean SE for each group and plotted as a function of time. At the end of treatment all mice were euthanized by COinhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Compound 8n showed significant tumor growth inhibition at this relatively low dose 6 mg kg as shown in . There was no significant body weight loss

Compound 8f will be further modified to thioketone analogs 41 and 42 Scheme 5 below . Compounds 8a z will be similarly modified. The carbonyl group can be converted into a thiocarbonyl group by the action of Lawesson s reagent Jesberger et al. 1929 1958 2003 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . The thioketone structure with conjugated aromatic rings is stable relative to unhindered thioketones. The thiazole compound can be obtained after dehydrogenation. Riedrich et al. 46 15 2701 2703 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . This conversion will decrease the hydrogen bond acceptor ability from O . . . H in ketone to S . . . H in thione. It will be helpful to examine the importance of hydrogen acceptor position in these molecules.

New analogs in which the carbonyl has been reduced to an alcohol 43 and 44 Scheme 6A below or reduced to methylene 45 and 46 Scheme 6B below will be synthesized. The alcohol 43 and 44 can be obtained using Grignard reaction of intermediate aldehyde with according Grignard reagents. Analogs 45 and 46 can be prepared with Clemmensen reduction of ketone function group to produce the corresponding hydrocarbon. When carbonyl is reduced to an alcohol or methylene the strong hydrogen acceptor C O reverses to strong hydrogen donor O H or hydrocarbon which totally loses hydrogen bond effects. This modification will provide insight as to the importance of carbonyl group and if it has a specific function in the anti cancer activity.

To examine the importance of ketone on antiproliferation in cancer cells this linker will be converted into amide and ester analogs 47 50 Scheme 7 below . Finding activity in any of these series of analogs the different linkages between the rings optimized to enhance activity and metabolic stability. As Scheme 7 below shows consistent with the results demonstrated in the preceding examples thiazoline and thiazole rings will be obtained from reaction of benzonitrile including substituted benzonitrile and cysteine Bergeron et al. 48 821 831 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety .

These analogs will be compared for antiproliferation activity on prostate cancer cells and or melanoma cells and control cells and compared to Compounds 8f and 8n.

Compounds will also be prepared with the trimethoxylphenyl group replaced with different substituted aromatic rings saturated or unsaturated alkyls and various heterocyclic groups as defined herein. This can be accomplished by using different Grignard reagents. These analogs will allow for optimization of the C ring with best activities lowest toxicity and best metabolic stability for prostate cancer melanoma and other cancers.

The P glycoprotein P gp system appears to be a primary physiological mechanism of multidrug resistance MDR which acts as an ATP dependent drug efflux pump actively removing a variety of structurally diverse cytotoxic compounds. Enhanced efflux of these compounds reduces their intracellular accumulation and so reduces their cytotoxicity. Therefore novel compounds which are not susceptible to drug resistance could be of high therapeutic and economic value. In addition to P gp clinically used antitubulin agents have other resistance mechanisms such as changes in microtubule dynamics and mutations in tubulin which are known to limit sensitivity to the taxanes. The anti tubulin compounds of the invention were tested against an ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR 8 parent and P gp over expressing NCI ADR RES cell line Table 7A .

Notably the anti tubulin compounds of the invention demonstrated equipotent antiproliferative effects against OVCAR 8 and NCI ADR RES cell lines suggesting that they are not P gp substrates and that they function in a P gp independent manner. This feature is distinct from that of paclitaxel vinblastine and colchicine in NCI ADR RES cells.

When the tumor volumes reached 300 mm the animals bearing PC 3 TxR tumors were treated with vehicle Tween80 DMSO HO 2 2 6 or 17ya 10 mg kg orally. The dosing schedule was 3 times a week for four weeks.

The ability of 17ya and 55 to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines was evaluated using SRB assay Table 9 . Both compounds inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines including five prostate and one glioma cancer cell lines with ICvalues in the low nanomolar range. 17ya exhibited 1.7 4.3 fold higher potency than 55 in these cell lines. Paclitaxel resistant PC 3 PC 3 TxR cell line that over expresses P glycoprotein P gp was used to study the effect of drug resistance on 17ya and 55 and to compare against its parent PC 3 cell line. The ICvalues of docetaxel were 1.2 0.1 nM and 17.7 0.7 nM in PC 3 and PC 3 TxR cells respectively. 17ya and 55 were both equipotent against parent PC 3 and PC 3 TxR whereas paclitaxel and docetaxel exhibited relative resistance of 85 and 15 fold respectively. These data indicate that both 17ya and 55 circumvent P gp mediated drug resistance.

17ya and 55 bind to colchicine binding site on tubulin inhibit tubulin polymerization and induce cell apoptosis . A competitive mass binding assay was developed to study the interaction of small molecule inhibitors with tubulin. In this study varying concentrations of 17ya or 55 were used to compete with colchicine tubulin binding. Both compounds competed effectively with colchicine for tubulin binding however their competitive binding curves deviated substantially from zero at higher concentrations when compared to podophylltoxin a known potent colchicine site binding ligand. This suggests that both 17ya and 55 exhibited less affinity than podophylltoxin or they partially bind to the colchicine binding site. Vinblastine the negative control did not inhibit the colchicine tubulin binding successfully demonstrating the specificity of this competitive mass binding assay.

Porcine brain tubulin 97 pure was incubated with 17ya or 55 5 M to test their effect on tubulin polymerization . 17ya and 55 inhibited tubulin polymerization by 47 and 40 at 15 min respectively. Colchicine at 5 M was used as a positive control and inhibited tubulin polymerization by 32 . These data suggest that both 17ya and 55 have slightly greater inhibition of tubulin polymerization than colchicine. Therefore the molecular mechanism of these compounds is binding to the colchicine binding site inhibiting tubulin polymerization and inducing cytotoxicity.

PC 3 and PC 3 TxR cells were exposed to 0.8 to 600 nmol L of 17ya 55 or docetaxel for 24 h. The levels of DNA histone complexes were used to represent cell apoptosis. Both 17ya and 55 were equally potent to induce cell apoptosis in PC 3 and PC 3 TxR in 24 h. Though docetaxel was highly potent to induce apoptosis of PC 3 cells it was weaker in PC 3 TxR cells due to over expression of P gp.

17ya and 55 exhibited favorable drug like properties. Drug like properties such as metabolic stability permeability aqueous solubility and drug drug interactions were examined for 17ya and 55 Table 10A . 17ya exhibited greater metabolic stability and aqueous solubility than 55. Both chemicals exhibited more than adequate permeability values suggesting their potential to be orally used. In addition both 17ya and 55 showed high ICvalues in micromolar range on CYP enzyme inhibition assays indicating that both compounds may avoid drug drug interactions through main CYP liver enzymes. Overall both compounds exhibited favorable drug like properties.

As shown in Table 10B 17ya had a half life of 80 min by phase I reaction suggesting that 17ya was stable in phase I metabolic processes. The half life 90 min in the presence of UDP glucuronic acid was similar to that observed in its absence. These data suggested that 17ya is stable in human liver microsomes and it was hoped that low clearance and long half life will be obtained in human. On the other hand 55 exhibited 30 and 43 min as half lives when it was in the presence and absence of UDP glucuronic acid respectively. Compound 12fa shows the half life with 44 in phase I. These data suggested that all three compounds showed acceptable stability in human liver microsomes and 17ya is more stable than 12fa and 55. When investigating their metabolism it was found that 12fa and 55 exhibited higher levels of ketone reduction data not shown suggesting that 12fa and 55 are more labile than 17ya.

Compound 17ya contained an imidazole ring and this ring improved aqueous solubility resulting in 75 g mL aqueous solubility Table 10A or 10B . Compounds 12fa and 55 exhibited less aqueous solubility and exhibited 12 and 19 g mL respectively. Overall 17ya demonstrated a great aqueous solubility and 12fa and 55 showed acceptable aqueous solubility and much improved over 1 h. The greater solubility of 12fa translated into much improved oral bioavailability compared to 1 h 35 vs. 3.3 in rat . Similarly for 17ya and 55 aqueous solubility correlated with much improved oral bioavailability as discussed infra Table 11 .

The pharmacokinetic parameters of 17ya and 55 given in a single i.v. or p.o. dose in ICR mice Sprague Dawley rats and beagle dogs are summarized in Table 11. 17ya exhibited low clearance in mice and rats suggesting that 17ya exhibited metabolic stability and minimal first pass metabolism in these species. In addition 17ya had moderate volume of distribution in mice and rats indicating that it may properly distribute into tissues including tumors. Unlike in mice and rats surprisingly the total clearance of 17ya in dogs was high. Two abundant metabolites in dog plasma a hydroxylated metabolite and an unknown metabolite with 34 m z of the parent data not shown were consistent with those found in dog liver microsomes. In summary higher clearance and lower oral exposure was obtained for 17ya compared to 55 in dogs but not in mice and rats. In addition 17ya exhibited abundant metabolites only in dog liver microsomes but not in mouse rat or human liver microsomes data not shown . 17ya showed acceptable 21 36 and 50 oral bioavailability in rats mice and dogs respectively. Meanwhile 55 had low clearance in rats and moderate clearance in mice and dogs. Similar to 17ya 55 exhibited moderate volume of distribution in these species. 55 had constant oral bioavailability rates among three species 24 36 . These properties indicate that both 17ya and 55 are potential orally available tubulin inhibitors.

PC 3 and paclitaxel resistant prostate cancer PC 3 TxR cells were inoculated in nude mice and the tumor volumes were allowed to reach about 150 300 mm. Docetaxel 10 or 20 mg kg which is in clinic for prostate cancer was used to evaluate its effectiveness in models of P gp mediated drug resistance in vivo. PC 3 TxR tumor was found to be fast growing and the volume reached 1500 2500 mmat the termination of the study. Though 10 and 20 mg kg intravenously administered docetaxel exhibited a dose response in both models the tumor growth inhibition TGI effect decreased from 84 TGI in PC 3 tumors to 14 TGI in PC 3 TxR tumors when intravenously dosed at 10 mg kg Table 12 . In addition at the higher dose 20 mg kg docetaxel elicited partial regression 100 TGI of PC 3 tumors but barely 56 TGI in PC 3 TxR tumors. The effectiveness of docetaxel in PC 3 TxR tumors was dramatically decreased when compared to that in PC 3 tumors suggesting that the efficacy was impaired by P gp mediated drug resistance and these results are in very good agreement with our in vitro cytotoxicity or apoptosis data. In contrast to the lack of efficacy of docetaxel in PC 3 TxR tumors orally administered 17ya 6.7 mg kg demonstrated more than 100 TGI without an effect on their body weights and Table 12 . In addition 2 out of 4 nude mice bearing PC 3 TxR tumors were tumor free on day 19 data not shown .

The PC 3 TxR xenograft model was further utilized to evaluate efficacies of 17ya in other dosing schedules and 55. The maximal tolerated dose body weight loss 20 of 17ya was found to be 10 mg kg when orally dosed once daily for four days or at 3.3 mg kg twice a day b.i.d. for five days data not shown.

As shown in 3.3 mg kg of 17ya was dosed b.i.d. for first consecutive four days in the first week and the schedule was then changed to once daily between weeks 2 and 4. The result shows that partial regression was obtained during day 4 19 and the TGI was 97 and one of the seven mice was tumor free on day 26. Higher dose 10 mg kg with lower dosing frequency q2d of 17ya elicited partial regression during days 13 to 29. These data suggest that regimens with optimized doses and dosing schedules will facilitate 17ya to successfully inhibit PC 3 TxR tumors. 55 was orally administered to nude mice with 10 or 30 mg kg b.i.d. and five times a week between weeks 1 and 4. As shown in the inhibition profiles exhibit a dose response in PC 3 TxR tumor. The TGI value was 59 for the treatment group with a lower dose 10 mg kg . Moreover the higher dose 30 mg kg started to show partial regression 100 TGI from day 19 to the termination of the study day 26 . Some mice in the vehicle group lost body weight at the endpoint in part due to cancer cachexia. On the contrary mice treated with 17ya 3.3 mg kg or 55 30 mg kg were gaining weight Table 12 suggesting that these optimized doses of 17ya or 55 may be well tolerated and were preventive of cancer cachexia.

Whole brain concentrations in nude mice at 1 h and 4 h after oral administration of 20 mg kg 17ya or 55 were determined Table 13 . The ratios of brain to plasma concentrations were determined and compared to docetaxel in the nude mice. 55 exhibited greater brain penetration than 17ya and docetaxel. 17ya only exhibited slightly greater brain plasma concentration ratios than docetaxel at both 1 and 4 h. The brain concentrations of 55 reached 14 to 19 of plasma concentrations at 1 h and 4 h respectively showing a 3.2 fold higher brain plasma ratio at both 1 h and 4 h compared to docetaxel. These data suggest that 55 exhibited potentially favorable properties to treat glioma since it has greater brain penetration and high potency 22 nM Table 9 in glioma cells.

HUVECs Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were cultured and grown in EGM 2 BulletKit Lonza Cat No. CC 3162 which contains growth supplements including hydrocortisone human fibroblast growth factor basic with heparin hFGF B vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF insulin like growth factor 1 IGF 1 ascorbic acid heparin fetal bovine serum human epidermal growth factor hEGF and GA 1000 gentamicin and amphotericin B in Endothelial Cell Basal Medium 2. Cells between the third and fifth passages were used for experiments. PC 3 human prostate cancer cells and T47D human breast cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5 fetal bovine serum.

Cytotoxic or antiproliferative activity of test compounds was investigated in several cell lines using the sulforhodamine B SRB assay. Cultured cells were plated into 96 well plates and incubated in medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds for 24 h or 48 h. Cells were stained with sulphorhodamine B SRB solution. The optical density was determined at 540 nm on a microplate reader Dynex Technologies Chantilly Va. . Plots of percent inhibition of cell growth versus drug concentration were constructed and the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50 relative to the vehicle control IC was determined by nonlinear least squares regression using WinNonlin software Pharsight Corporation Cary N.C. .

Capillary formation assays were performed in 96 well plates by plating 12 000 cells wells of HUVECs on a Matrigel layer BD Biosciences . In order to evaluate the anti capillary action capillaries were allowed to form over a 16 h period before the addition of test compound or vehicle control. In addition capillary formation inhibitory effect of test compound was investigated by treating HUVEC cells with test compounds before capillary formation. Images were acquired immediately following compound addition 5 10 15 and 25 h after exposure to test compound. Capillary formation was quantified by counting the number of tubes and nodes having at least three edges.

The permeability of an endothelial cell monolayer was assessed in the transwell system. HUVECs were plated at 2 10cells per insert of 24 well plates in EGM 2 medium and incubated for 72 h to reach 100 confluency. Test compounds were diluted in EGM 2 medium and added to the upper chamber of the apparatus. Following 1 2 and 4 h of incubation the compounds were removed and 75 g mL of FITC conjugated dextran MW 40 000 was added for 5 minutes. Fluorescent measurements of the lower chamber were taken after excitation at 485 nm and emission was measured at 520 nm using a BioTek Synergy 4 Microplate Reader.

17ya and 55 were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against growth factor supplemented endothelial cells and growth factor deprived endothelial cell cultures. Combretastatin A 4 CA4 and doxorubicin were used as positive and negative control respectively. Compound 17ya exhibited higher potency than compound 55 against actively proliferating endothelial cells Table 14 and . Both 17ya and 55 exhibited selectivity for endothelial cells showing lower ICvalues compared to one of the prostate cancer cells. CA4 17ya and 55 were 8 5 and 3 times more active against endothelial cells than against cancer cells respectively while doxorubicin was not specific to endothelial cells Table 14 and . However no selectivity was observed between quiescent and active endothelial cells with these compounds data not shown .

The activity of 17ya was investigated on endothelial cells engaged in capillary tube formation in vitro. Endothelial cells were placed on a Matrigel matrix and the formation and construction of capillary tubes in the presence or absence of compounds were observed CA4 doxorubicin and 17ya .

To avoid confusion between early stage of tube formation and disruption of tube construction HUVEC cells on matrix in the presence of drug treatment were incubated for 15 h. Then disruption of capillary was determined by counting the number of tubes and nodes in each treatment group. On the other hand to evaluate the effect of test compound in preformed capillaries HUVEC cells on matrix were allowed to form capillary tube for 16 h and the capillaries were treated with test compounds.

As a result the number of tubes and nodes was gradually decreased over time due to deficiency or consumption of nutrient by HUVEC cells . This trend was observed in every drug treatment group . In order to examine the difference between untreated and pretreated capillaries 15 h incubation groups were compared .

Endothelial cells that were exposed to various concentrations of 17ya 0 to 50 M plated on Matrigel matrix resulted in inhibition of tube formation in a dose dependent manner. 17ya with approximate ICvalue of 5 nM in cell growth inhibition studies inhibited more than 50 of tube formation compared to vehicle control . 17ya at 10 nM completely inhibited the tube formation . However in the preformed capillaries the 10 nM 17ya treatment group did not disrupt the capillary structure by 15 h . These results suggest that 17ya inhibits the formation of endothelial capillaries significantly but is less effective to disrupt preformed capillaries. Similar result was observed in CA4 treatment group . However doxorubicin did not affect the capillary construction at toxic concentration.

Antitubulin agents could modify the integrity of endothelial cell layers lining blood vessels by targeting cytoskeleton of the endothelial cells. Thus the vascular disruption effect of antitubulin agent is known to increase the permeability of blood vessel and thus could lead to protein leakage and high blood viscosity. This could result in reduction of blood flow causing subsequent tumor death from hypoxia and nutrient deprivation.

The effect of 17ya and 55 was evaluated on vascular permeability using in vitro study using transwell system with confluent HUVEC monolayers. The change in permeability by test compound was measured by the leakage of dextran MW 40 000 after 1 2 and 4 h of drug treatment. CA4 was used as a positive control. CA4 17ya and 55 resulted in increased permeability and the effect was more pronounced at 1 h incubation data was not shown . 17ya showed a potency similar to CA4 . Doxorubicin did not induce any change in the permeability of endothelial cell monolayer .

HL60 cells 10 10per mL were prepared in RPMI1640 growth media containing 10 FBS and mixed with Matrigel BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. at 1 1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 L of the mixture 5 10cells per animal subcutaneously into the flank of 6 8 week old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume mm was calculated by the formula 6 L W where length L and width W were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 200 mmapproximately the animals bearing HL60 tumors were treated with vehicle Tween80 DMSO HO 2 2 6 or 17ya 20 mg kg orally. The dosing schedule was once a week for two weeks. Vincristine 1 mg mL was administrated via intraperitoneal injection once a week.

Human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL60 cells were inoculated in nude mice and the tumor volumes were allowed to reach about 200 mm. Vincristine 1 mg kg which is in clinic for hematological cancers including leukemia was used to evaluate the response of this in vivo model against a positive control drug. The tumor volumes mm were plotted against time and are the means SD from four to five animals. HL60 tumor was found to be fast growing and the volume reached 2000 3000 mmwithin two weeks. Though 1 mg kg intraperitoneal injection of vincristine exhibited very potent tumor growth inhibitory effect and the tumor growth inhibition TGI was 84 . Orally administered 17ya 20 mg kg showed 40 tumor growth inhibition. The size of HL60 tumors was maintained up to 5 days after 17ya treatment without dramatic increase but during the next 2 days tumor sizes increased significantly 60 100 . It suggests that a more frequent dosing schedule could enhance the tumor growth inhibitory effect of 17ya.

Compound 31a was synthesized by the addition of sodium hydride 60 dispersion in mineral oil 20 mg 0.5 mmol to 31 and stirred for 20 min.

Metabolic stability studies were conducted for compound 17ya and 31 by incubating 0.5 M of test compounds in a total reaction volume of 1 mL containing 1 mg mL microsomal protein in reaction buffer 0.2 M of phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 1.3 mM NADP 3.3 mM glucose 6 phosphate and 0.4 U mL glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase at 37 C. in a shaking water bath. The NADPH regenerating system solution A and B was obtained from BD Biosciences Bedford Mass. . For glucuronidation studies 2 mM UDP glucuronic acid Sigma St. Louis Mo. cofactor in deionized water was incubated with 8 mM MgCl 25 g of alamethicin Sigma St. Louis Mo. in deionized water and NADPH regenerating solutions BD Biosciences Bedford Mass. as described previously. The total DMSO concentration in the reaction solution was approximately 0.5 v v . Aliquots 100 L from the reaction mixtures used to determine metabolic stability were sampled at 5 10 30 60 90 and 120 min. Acetonitrile 150 L containing 200 nM of the internal standard was added to quench the reaction and to precipitate the proteins. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 000 g for 30 min at RT and the supernatant was analyzed directly by LC MS MS.

Sample solution 10 L was injected into an Agilent series HPLC system Agilent 1100 Series Agilent 1100 Chemstation Agilent Technology Co Ltd . All analytes were separated on a narrow bore C18 column Alltech Alltima HP 2.1 100 mm 3 m Fisher Fair Lawn N.J. . Two gradient modes were used.

The solubility of drugs was determined by Multiscreen Solubility Filter Plate Millipore Corporate Billerica Mass. coupled with LC MS MS. Briefly 198 L of phosphate buffered saline PBS buffer pH 7.4 was loaded into 96 well plate and 2 L of 10 mM test compounds in DMSO was dispensed and mixed with gentle shaking 200 300 rpm for 1.5 hours at RT N 3 . The plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min and the filtrate was used to determine its concentration and solubility of test compound by LC MS MS as described previously.

Female Sprague Dawley rats n 3 254 4 g were purchased from Harlan Inc. Indianapolis Ind. . Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. Braintree Mass. . On arrival at the animal facility the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature controlled room 20 22 C. with a 12 h light dark cycle before any treatment.

Compounds 17ya 31 and 31a Exhibit Broad Cytotoxicity in Cancer Cells Including Multidrug Resistant Cancer Cells.

The ability of 17ya 31 and 31a to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines was evaluated using an SRB assay Table 15 . All three compounds inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines including prostate lung colon breast uterine doxorubicin resistant uterine ovarian and adriamycin resistant ovarian cancer cell lines with ICvalues in the low nanomolar range.

Doxorubicin resistant MES SA MES SA DX5 cell line and adriamycin resistant OVCAR8 NCI ADR RES cell line that express high levels of mdr 1 mRNA resulting in the over expression of P glycoprotein P gp were used to study the effect of 17ya 31 and 31a on multi drug resistant cell lines and to compare results against parent lines MES SA cell line and OVCAR8 cell line respectively. The ICvalues of docetaxel DTX were 0.1 nM and 26 nM in MES SA and MES SA DX5 cells respectively and 0.4 nM and 2471 nM in OVCAR8 and NCI ADR RES cells respectively demonstrating a significant reduction of effectiveness in drug resistant cancer cells. Docetaxel exhibited relative resistance of 4260 fold resistance factor MES SA vs. MES SA DX5 and 6042.5 fold resistance factor OVCAR8 vs. NCI ADR RES respectively. In contrast compounds 17ya 31 and 31a were equipotent against parent MES SA or OVCAR8 cell lines and MES SA DX5 or NCI ADR RES multidrug resistant cell lines respectively. Uniformly 17ya 31 and 31a demonstrated at least an order of magniture i.e. 10 fold increased potency compared to DTX in multidrug resistant cells lines. Table 15 These data indicate that 17ya 31 and 31a circumvent P gp mediated drug resistance.

As shown in 17ya had a half life that was much longer than 31 or 31a as seen by the larger area under the curve in in vitro phase I reactions with human liver microsomes. This suggested that 17ya was stable in phase I metabolic processes. These data suggested that all three compounds showed acceptable stability in human liver microsomes and 17ya is more stable than 31 or 31a.

Drug like properties such as metabolic stability bioavailability AUC min g mL clearance Cl mL min kg and steady state volume of distribution Vss L kg were examined for 17ya 31 and 31a metabolic stability only for 31a A B and C Table 16 . 17ya exhibited superior metabolic stability compared with 31 and 31a . As seen in the concentration time plots 17ya also demonstrated superior stability in vivo when injected B and dose orally compared to 31 Table 16 .

Cell culture of prostate lung colon breast uterine and ovarian cancer cell lines was as above in Example 21. Additionally MCF7 breast cells were obtained from ATCC American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA . Cell lines were used to develop xenografts in order to test in vivo the anti tumor growth activity of compound 17ya 2 1H indol 3 yl imidazol 4 yl 3 4 5 trimethoxyphenyl methanone.

PC 3 PC 3 TxR MES SA DX5 OVCAR8 NCI ADR RES A549 C26 and MCF7 cells 10 10per mL were prepared in RPMI1640 growth media containing 10 FBS and mixed with Matrigel BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. at 1 1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 L of the mixture 5 10cells per animal subcutaneously s.c. into the flank of 6 8 week old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume mm was calculated by the formula 6 L W where length L and width W were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 300 mm the animals bearing tumors were treated with vehicle Tween80 DMSO HO 2 2 6 or docetaxel DTX 10 mg kg once per week or 17ya intravenously or orally. The dosing schedule for 17ya included trials at 7 mg kg once per week 10 mg kg once per week 15 mg kg once per week 15 mg kg twice per week 15 mg kg three times per week and 20 mg kg once per week.

Compound 17ya Inhibits Tumor Growth in Nude Mice Bearing Prostate Paclitaxel Resistant Prostate PC3 TXR Ovarian Adriamycin Resistant Ovarian NCI ADR RES Doxorubicin Resistant Uterine MES SA DX5 Lung and Colon Cancer Xenografts.

PC3 paclitaxel resistant prostate cancer PC 3 TxR doxorubicin resistant uterine cancer MES SA DX5 ovarian cancer adriamycin resistant ovarian cancer NCI ADR RES lung cancer and colon cancer cells were inoculated in nude mice and the tumor volumes were allowed to reach about 150 300 mm. Docetaxel 10 mg kg which is in the clinic for prostate cancer was used as a positive control to evaluate its effectiveness in models of parental and P gp mediated drug resistant xenografts in vivo.

Ten 10 mg kg intravenously administered docetaxel exhibited tumor growth inhibition TGI in xenografts PC 3 prostate xenografts of 84 and to a lesser extent in OVCAR8 ovarian TGI of 22 A549 lung TGI of 44 and C26 colon TGI of 35 . DTX administration exhibited less than 5 TGI in breast cancer xenografts. In comparison Table 17 shows that intravenous or oral administration of 17ya 10 15 20 mg kg exhibited reduced tumor growth over a wide range of tumor types including xenografts of PC3 prostate TGI of 72 and 83 OVCAR8 ovarian TGI of 63 A549 lung TGI of 62 and C26 colon TGI of 61 . Thus compound 17ya was effective in a range of tumor types and particularly showed significantly greater TGI than DTX in ovarian lung and colon cancers.

Comparison of prostate and prostate MDR tumor growth showed that administration of DTX 10 mg kg resulted in a significantly decreased TGI effect from 84 TGI in PC 3 tumors compared with only 14 TGI in PC 3 TxR tumors Table 17 . Thus the effectiveness of docetaxel in PC 3 TxR tumors was dramatically decreased when compared to that in PC 3 tumors suggesting that the efficacy of DTX was impaired by P gp mediated drug resistance. In contrast to the lack of efficacy of docetaxel in PC 3 TxR tumors orally administered 17ya 20 mg kg demonstrated more than 100 TGI in PC3 TXr xenografts.

In addition 17ya showed effective tumor growth inhibition TGI in MDR xenografts from NCI ADR RES adriamycin resistant ovarian cancer cells of 99.6 TGI and for MES SA DX5 doxorubicin resistant uterine cancer cells the efficacy was 60 and 72 TGI. Table 17 .

Effectiveness of 17ya in PC3 and PC3 TXR Xenografts Prostate Cancer and Paclitaxel Resistant Prostate Cancer Respectively .

Intravenously administered 17ya at 7 mg kg once per week or orally administered 17ya at 15 mg kg once per week in mice bearing PC3 xenografts demonstrated dose responsive reduction 7 mg kg and essentially no growth 15 mg kg in PC3 tumors . The efficacy of 17ya to inhibit tumor growth did not effect body weights during this same time period .

Similarly orally administered 17ya 15 mg kg once per week exhibited dose responsive inhibition of PC3 TXR tumor growth in the absence of body weight changes during the same time period .

Orally administered 17ya at 15 mg kg once per week or three times per week in mice bearing NCI ADR RES xenografts demonstrated dose responsive inhibition of tumor growth and reduction of tumor size . The efficacy of 17ya to inhibit tumor growth did not effect body weights during this same time period .

Orally administered 17ya at either 15 mg kg twice per week or 20 mg kg once per week in mice bearing MES SA DX5 xenografts demonstrated dose responsive inhibition of tumor growth in comparison with vehicle alone . The efficacy of 17ya to inhibit tumor growth did not affect body weights during this same time period . Using the data for comparison of the different 17ya dosages with intravenously administered DTX at 10 mg kg once a week showed 17ya at 15 mg kg twice per week to be the most effective dosage for tumor growth inhibition 72 . 17ya at 20 mg kg once per week showed 60 tumor growth inhibition while DTX showed only 47 tumor growth inhibition.

The effectiveness of 17ya to reduce tumor size of ovarian xenoraphs was markedly increased with a twice weekly dosage regime. While orally administered 17ya at 20 mg kg once per week in mice bearing OVCAR8 xenografts showed minimal reduction of tumor size 8 orally administered 17ya at 15 mg kg twice per week exhibited significant tumor size reduction 63 compared with vehicle alone . The effectiveness of intravenously administered DTX at 10 mg kg once per week was significantly less 22 than the twice weekly dose regime of 17ya 63 . The twice weekly 17ya dose regime showed minimal weight increase over the same time period compared with vehicle alone .
