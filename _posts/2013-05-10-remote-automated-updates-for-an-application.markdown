title: Remote automated updates for an application
abstract: In one embodiment, a method updates a media program streaming application for a media program streaming service. The method downloads the application, which includes a bootstrap application, through a distribution site. The bootstrap application receives a manifest from a remote server that lists remote core files. The bootstrap application determines if a core memory contains updateable core files corresponding to the remote core files. The method determines if an updateable core file is present in the core memory that matches a remote core file and loads the updateable core file from the core memory into a memory. If an updateable core file that matches the remote core file is not present in the core memory, the method requests the remote core file from the remote server and loading the received remote core file into the memory. The method then executes the core files in the memory without recompilation.
