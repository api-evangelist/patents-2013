The present invention claims priority as a continuation in part regular utility patent application to Application Ser. No. 61 599 857 invented by Scott P. Loftin and Michael P. Armstrong entitled Marine Engine Drainage and Coolant Monitoring System and filed on 16 Feb. 2012.

The present invention relates in general to inboard marine motors and in particular to a system for draining water used as coolant from inboard marine motors.

Most marine inboard engines for small boats are marinized versions of automotive engines. Typically these engines use open cooling systems which take in water from the body of water the boat is in and circulate that water through a water jacket surrounding the engine to cool the engine. When the boat is not in use the water is trapped in the cooling system inside of the engine. During winter months the engine water must be drained to prevent it from freezing expanding and cracking the engine. Additionally the engine water also causes corrosive damage to the engine when left inside between regular operations. If it were easy to drain the engine the water could be drained after every use to prevent rust and scale from developing inside the water jacket of the engine.

In any climate where the air temperature falls below the freezing temperature of the lake water the owner typically drains and winterizes the engine and the boat cannot be used until there is no possibility of freezing weather. This causes an inconvenience to those who would like to use their boat during winter months. An invention that would make it easy for the average consumer to drain their engine would not only make it more convenient for people to use their boat in areas where it gets down to freezing a couple months out of the year but would also open up the market for this type of boat to colder areas. An additional advantage of easy drainage is compliance with new laws in some states requiring drainage of the engine and other water reservoirs from the boat whenever the boat is moved from one lake to another in an effort to prevent the spread of invasive aquatic species such as zebra mussels.

Several quick drain systems already exist but none of them have a way of verifying that they have functioned properly and thoroughly. Without a way of verifying that the drain has functioned properly there is no way of knowing if there is still water left in the engine. This could result in costly repairs and is a liability to the manufacturer of the drainage system and the manufacturer of the engine should they allow this type of system to be mounted to their engines. However with a way of verifying the end user and the manufacturer can rest assured that the boat is safe and ready to use year round.

Furthermore currently the only way to check that the engine cooling system is working properly is the thermometer. If the coolant system is working properly the thermometer will display an engine temperature that is within certain parameters specified by the engine manufacturer usually in the engine manual. If the coolant system is not working properly the only way of knowing is when the thermometer reads above normal. However by the time the thermometer reads above normal the engine is already overheating. To make things worse by the time the average boat owner notices that the temperature is above normal the boat is already being operated outside of the boathouse away from the dock or boat launch and the driver must either risk further overheating of the engine by driving back or play it safe and turn the engine off and paddle or swim the boat back. The manufacturer designs the engine operating temperatures with a factor of safety to allow for delayed detection of cooling system problems without immediate damage. However if there was a way of monitoring the engine cooling system the boat operator would be notified that the engine is not working properly before it over heats and before the boat leaves the boat house or dock. Additionally this ability for early detection would allow for the engine manufacturer to reduce the factor of safety thus allowing them to further optimize engine performance.

Valves currently available on the market typically are single port valves that control flow through one inlet and one outlet only. There are multiport valves although most are used to divert flow or mix fluids. There are no available options for draining multiple ports simultaneously while keeping the fluids separate when the valve is closed. The option of using multiple valves that can be actuated individually is viable however this quickly becomes expensive especially when using electric valves.

When draining multiple sources of fluid the goal is to pass the fluid through a bulkhead such as the hull of a boat or the wall of a container. The standard pipe fittings that pass through a bulkhead use NPSM thread National Pipe Straight Thread for Free Fitting Mechanical Joints . This thread allows the fitting to be secured to the bulkhead using a lock nut on the backside of the bulkhead but it provides a difficult joint to attach to since valves use NPT National Pipe Tapered Thread . In order to drain multiple hoses through one bulkhead fitting multiple valves would have to attach to a manifold to collect the fluid. Then the manifold would have to attach to the bulkhead fitting through a hose and an adapter fitting or an oversized hose that could fit over the bulkhead fitting and tighten using a hose clamp that would provide an imprecise connection. Another issue confronting automated drainage is the presence of fluid at the output of the valve. If there is fluid at the output of the valve before it opens then the inlet fluid will not be able to flow through the valve as desired once it is opened. A sensor that could detect fluid at the output would be very beneficial to allow for the output to be cleared before attempting to drain.

A novel marine engine drainage and coolant monitoring system that consists of fittings that attach to each part of the engine cooling system that must be drained engine block exhaust manifold transmission and hoses and hose attachments thereto linking areas of the engine that must be drained to a single drainage device to provide quick and easy drainage of the engine. Additionally located at each fitting is a water sensor that communicates with a central control module to ensure proper drainage of the engine and proper functionality of the engine cooling system during normal engine operation.

The drainage valve device may be a valve plug or packer assembly that is actuated mechanically such as by handle or cable electrically hydraulically or pneumatically. However when disposed in the closed position the drainage valve device should prevent the fluid cross flow between each of the drain ports for the engine. If the fluid is not maintained separately then the fluid can flow from the engine block to the exhaust manifolds circumventing the engine thermostat and causing the engine to operate at an undesired temperature. So to ensure proper engine functionality a drainage collector such as seen in the patent to Hubbs et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7 438 613 cannot be used because the fluid in the drain hoses mixes upstream of the valve but a drainage device such as seen in the patent to Henderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 693 690 can be used because the fluid in the drain hoses does not mix until after the stopper is removed.

Since drainage of the engine is powered by the force of gravity the drainage device must be located at the lowest point in the boat s hull below all parts of the engine that require drainage. The hoses connecting the drain fittings to the drainage device must maintain a downward slope as to not trap any water within the system. The drainage device can be secured in place to the boat structure to make it a stable and stationary installation to ensure no damage to the boat or device during normal boating operations. Preferably the drainage device should be connected to a through hull opening such as that used by the engine to intake water from the lake or that used by the bilge pump to remove water from the lower parts of the inside of the hull. In that way the water will be drained outside of the hull to prevent more water from accumulating inside the hull of the boat than what is experienced from normal operation of the boat. The drainage device can also be installed inside the bilge which will not require any additional holes through the hull but will drain all cooling water into the bilge.

Integrated within each of the engine block exhaust manifold transmission and hose drainage fittings is a fluid sensor which will detect the presence of water in each compartment of the cooling system. These sensors must be made from materials that are heat resistant to engine operating temperatures as well as corrosion resistant to lake water and chemicals that could be in the engine water. The fluid sensors do not necessarily have to be integrated with the fittings since the engine manufacturer has the option of drilling new holes in the engine next to the fitting location where the sensors can be mounted to be able to detect engine water. Electrical wires connect each of the sensors to a central control that can be operated by the boat owner or to the engines computer to be controlled automatically.

A central control module console is provided for monitoring the fluid sensors. The console will preferably be powered by the battery of the boat. The console will have a power switch to turn the system on and off a second switch to manually control the draining device and a single indicator light for each sensor. The console will also preferably have a processor memory and a dip switch located within the console to select between whether the drainage device is installed in a through hull configuration or an in bilge configuration and to determine the number of fluid sensors which are being be used. When the power switch is turned on it will send electricity to each of the sensors. If there is water in the part of the cooling system where each sensor is located it will complete the electrical circuit and the light for that particular section will light up indicating there is water in that part of the engine. After the drainage device is actuated and all the water has drained from the engine there will no longer be water to complete the electrical circuit with each sensor and each light will turn off. If one light does not turn off it indicates that the drainage system did not work properly and there is a problem with that particular section.

The console will have the ability to make sure that the cooling system is functioning properly while the boat is running. If the electrical circuit from one of the sensors is not closed by the presence of water it will indicate to the console that coolant water is not reaching that part of the engine. It would also be beneficial to have a flow rate sensor in line with the hose coming off of the raw water intake to make sure that water is flowing through the engine and not just sitting getting hotter. The console can then set off an alarm or warning to the boat operator letting them know that one or more sections of the engine is not getting circulation and the engine could therefore over heat and damage could occur.

The console preferably has a data processor which has a data output allowing the console to communicate with the engine s computer or any other onboard computing devices. This way the engine manufacturer can use this information to further optimize engine performance and the boat manufacturer can display information from the console on boat dashboard displays.

A through hull installation of the drainage device preferably allows the engine to drain itself every time the engine is turned off by actuating the drainage device to the opened position and draining all necessary sections of the engine preventing corrosion rust and scale and the potential for the engine water to freeze in cold temperatures. The drainage device will have to be actuated electronically so that the engine can automatically actuate the device when the engine is turned off. A boat in water sensor located at the through hull fitting will verify that the boat is out of the water and prevent the drainage device from opening while the boat is in the water. If all of the parts of the engine do not drain properly in the right amount of time the console will be able to check each sensor and determine which part of the engine is not draining properly. The console can then set off an alarm letting the boat operator know that the engine has not drained properly and which part of the engine is the problem.

An in bilge installation of the drainage device will preferably be manually actuated since there will be no additional hole in the hull for a boat in water sensor. The console will then continue the drainage procedure check all of the sensors for water and set off an alarm if an area did not drain properly.

A drain valve is provided which preferably connects multiple inlets to one output and seals all inlets simultaneously using an expansion plug. The single valve is operable to drain fluid from all ports at the same time by unloading the expansion plug and removing it from obstructing the ports. The plug may be linearly actuated rotary actuated or screw actuated. The inlets are threaded with tapered pipe thread to accept standard pipe fittings. The outlet through the bottom of the valve body is threaded with NPSM straight pipe thread to attach directly to standard through bulkhead pipe fittings. The valve body houses a fluid sensor in the outlet to allow the controls to detect fluid blocking the outlet before the valve opens which would prevent drainage.

The valve closes using an expansion plug to block all of the inlets. This keeps the fluid flow from each hose separate when it is in the closed configuration. To open the valve the plug is decompressed and pulled up and out of the way providing large unobstructed pathways for the fluid to flow out of the valve.

A linear electric actuator can be used to power the valve or it can be operated manually using a threaded stem similar to a globe valve that is typically used for garden hose spigots. Fluid from all of the inlets collects at the center of the valve and drains down through the outlet in the bottom of the valve body. The outlet is threaded with NPSM straight thread to allow the valve body to attach directly to a through bulkhead pipe fitting.

The engine setup shown in is an inboard V drive setup typically used in wakeboard specific boats. In this configuration the engine is located at the back of the boat. The transmission or V drive is attached to the front of the engine and reverts power down and back through the bottom of the boat into the propeller not shown creating a V shape. This invention is not limited to this particular engine setup and will work with any inboard engine that must be drained from drainage plugs and disconnection of coolant hoses.

The drain tubes are preferably as large as practically possible while still able to attach to the drainage device to allow for quick unobstructed drainage and venting of the coolant from the engine . Each fitting is mechanically secured to each part of the engine that must be drained which may include but are not limited to both engine block plugs both exhaust manifold plugs the transmission and subsequent hose leading up to the impeller pump housing and the hose connecting the thermostat to the circulator pump. The drainage device is preferably located at a point in the hull lower than any part of the engine and cooling system. The drain tubes should maintain a downward slope from the drain fittings to the multiport drainage device to ensure that no water is prevented from draining. The drain tubes must be heat resistant since they will experience engine operating temperatures up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The drainage device must keep the fluid from each drainage hose separate when it is in the closed configuration. Therefore it would be best for this device to be either a multiport plug or packer assembly or a multiport valve that opens up all fluid hoses simultaneously when actuated. The drainage device could even be multiple electric solenoid valves that actuate simultaneously with one electrical switch. In this example the drainage device is placed in front of the V drive transmission since there is typically an access port under the rear seat which will provide quick and easy access to this location.

The fitting displayed in is one of the engine block fittings. The higher performance engines require knock sensors to monitor engine performance. Typically these knock sensors are mounted to an engine block drain plug. In order for this system to be installed as an aftermarket product this assembly must provide a location to mount the knock sensor and the fitting must be designed such that it has a secure and stable connection with the engine to transfer vibrations successfully to the knock sensor. This assembly has a fluid sensor which has specially cut pipe threads which allow it to mount flush to a standard pip thread fitting allowing all vibrations to transfer into the body of the probe. The knock sensor mounts to the back side of the fluid sensor housing . The different drain fittings will have slightly different construction to accommodate the specific location in which it is used.

Preferably the drainage device would be an electrically actuated multiport drain valve . is a perspective view an exploded view and a side elevation view of an upper portion of a multiport drain valve . Multiport drain valve preferably has an actuator section and a valve section . The actuator section has an actuator mounting bracket which is mounted a linear actuator .

A bolt and nut assembly is provided for securing the actuator to the mounting bracket . A seal piston is mounted to the lowermost end of the actuator rod . The seal piston has seal glands in which seal rings are disposed. The seal rings are preferably O rings. A seal element is provided by an elastomeric seal member which provides a plug seal for fitting within the valve section of the multiport drain valve . Washer and fastener preferably a shoulder screw are provided for securing the seal element beneath the piston .

Tubing nipples are threadingly secured in the flow ports . The tubing nipples having outward barbed ends for fitting within and securing ends of the drain tubes thereto. One of the fluid sensors are threadingly secured in the fluid sensor port .

Referring to beginning at node F block drainage of the system of the engine block is initiated. In step a display in block sensors are scanned. In step the alarm has beeped once the good LEDs off and the check LED is blinking in block . Then the process proceeds to the decision block and a determination is made as to whether the valve current is zero. If not the process proceeds back to block and again the determination is made as to whether valve current is zero. If the valve load current is zero the process proceeds to step and the controller opens the drain valve fully. The process then proceeds to node C shown in . shows a process having two initiation points one is node B which refers to node B in and the second is node C which refers to node C in .

As shown in once a determination is made in decision block that the ignition switch is not on the process proceeds to decision block and a fluid sensor determines whether moisture is detected. If so the process proceeds to step and the check LED is turned to on the good LED is turned to off and the alarm is turned to off. The process then proceeds to step and the timer is set to ten minutes. The process then proceeds to step and all the flow sensors are checked to make a determination of whether fluid is present. Then at decision block a determination is made of whether water is detected by one of the moisture sensors. If not the process proceeds over to decision block which is discussed below. If moisture is present the process proceeds to step and the timer is decremented by a selected increment. Then the process proceeds to decision block where the ten minute timer has finished timing and clocked out. If not the process proceeds to decision block and a determination is made in that step is whether the ignition switch is on. If not the process proceeds back to step discussed above. Yes the proceeds to node A which is shown in . A determination is made in decision block the timer is finished the process proceeds to node A in .

If in step a determination is made that water is not detected by the fluid sensors the process proceeds to step . Similarly the process proceeding from mode C in will also proceed to block . In step the alarm has beeped once the good LED is turned off and the check LED begins blinking. The process then proceeds to step and the timer is set to ten minute intervals. The process then proceeds to step and the moisture sensors are checked to determine whether moisture is present. The process then proceeds to step and makes a determination whether water is detected. If water is detected the process proceeds to step the alarm has beeped once the good LED turns on and the check LED is turned off. In step the multiport drain valve is kept in an open position the process proceeds to node A and returns to node A in . If in decision block a determination is made that there is water present the process proceeds to step and the timer is decremented. Then in decision block a determination is made of whether the timer interval preferably ten minutes has completed. If so the alarm is sounded and check LED is turned on in step . If the check LED is turned on then the process proceeds to decision block and a determination is made as whether the ignition switch is still on. If the ignition switch is still on the process returns to node A of . If in step the timer is not finished the process proceeds to step and a determination is made as whether the ignition switch is on. If the ignition switch is not on the process proceeds back to step to scan the moisture sensors.

For the in bilge installation to drain the engine the operator must press the manual valve switch and the console will start the drainage procedure for opening the drain valve . When the manual drain switch is in the on position all lights should light up indicating fluid in each part of the engine and the proper functioning of the drain system . Once all lights are verified to be lit the control console can actuate the drainage valve to release coolant from all drain ports of to the engine . Once all the coolant is drained from the engine all of the indicator lights should turn off. If a one of the indicator lights does not turn off this indicates that there is a blockage or other malfunction in that part of the system and proper steps must be taken to ensure that part of the engine drains properly. Once all of the water indicator lights have been verified to be off the control console can go to sleep mode and wait for the manual drainage switch to be pushed on again. It is the operators option to return the drainage device to the closed position at this time because condensation can build inside the engine and collect usually not enough to crack the engine but enough to cause corrosion. If the drainage device is closed then condensation will be trapped in the engine . The control console will return the drainage device to the closed position when the boat is turned on again. For the boat operator to verify there is coolant in the system during boat operation he can view the control console and verify that all of the fluid indicator lights are on. If one or more of the indicator lights does not light up the engine coolant system is not functioning properly and an alarm will sound. For this instance the engine water will drain into the bilge area lower port of the hull . This water is typically removed from the bottom of the boat during normal care taking which requires vacuuming the bilge to remove water built up from wet persons and equipment entering the boat and water coming over the side of the boat. While it sounds bad to empty the engine water into the hull of the boat this water only accounts for a small fraction of the water that collects in the bilge during normal use.

In the through hull installation the drainage device is attached to a through hull fitting which allows the engine water to be drained out of the boat completely. When the boat operator turns on the engine the control console will apply an electrical signal to the fluid sensors in the drain fittings . If the control console detects continuity between the two electrodes of a fluid sensor the control console will thus determine that fluid is connecting between the two electrodes in the respective drain port of the engine . The control console may also check the fluid sensors periodically to monitor whether the cooling system is functioning properly. It would also be beneficial to have a flow sensor in line with the raw water intake hose to make sure that water is flowing through the cooling system and not just sitting in the engine heating up. If there is no water in one of the parts of the engine monitored by the fluid sensors or if water is not flowing through the cooling system the control console can alert the operator that there is a problem. Many of the new boats have display screens on the drivers dash board which display many things including engine diagnostics. If this invention were coupled with a display such as this the control console could then display the specific problem to the boat operator. When the boat operator turns off the engine the control console will electronically actuate the drain device to release all of the water from the cooling system of the engine . The control console may also monitor the fluid sensors until all the fluid sensors stop returning a signal at which point the control console can acknowledge to the boat operator that drainage was successful and shutdown. If the control console continues to receive a signal from a fluid sensor for a longer amount of time than it should take to drain then the control console may set off an audible alarm and a visual alarm which alerts the boat operator that there is a malfunction and exactly where the malfunction is located. For this instance the discharge port of the drain valve should be securely attached to a through hull port either a drain secured to a hole cut in the bottom of the boat or tied into the intake of the cooling system. Otherwise if the boat engine is turned off while the boat is in the water and the discharge port of the drain valve is set up to release the water into the hull water will be forced from the body of water through the cooling system and into the boat sinking the boat. However if the drain valve is securely set up to release the water through the hull and out of the boat the engine water will not drain while the boat is in the water but since the system will be closed the boat will not take on water and will not sink. For drainage the boat must be out of the water on either a boat lift or a trailer. Additionally for this instance the fluid sensor do not necessarily have to be integrated with the drain fitting since the engine manufacturer has the option of drilling new holes in the engine next to an engine block drain port where the drain fitting is located.

Both instances of this invention allow the engine of the boat to be drained quickly conveniently and verifiably without entering the engine compartment without unscrewing multiple engine plugs and without unfastening any coolant hoses. Should any of the drain tubes or fittings become clogged with moss grass dirt rust or scale the console or engine computer will indicate this to the boat operator. Other drainage systems that provide quick and easy drainage but do not provide any method for verifying drainage of every part of the cooling system are setting the boat owner up for costly repairs when their drainage systems visually appear to have worked and then water trapped by debris cracks the engine block. These other systems also cannot be installed by boat manufacturers because they cannot be trusted and they provide a large liability to the manufacturer.

Although the preferred embodiment has been described in detail it should be understood that various changes substitutions and alterations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
