This application is continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 424 233 filed Mar. 19 2012 which is entitled to the benefit of provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 453 867 filed Mar. 17 2011 entitled Method and system to plan design construct and deploy buildings both of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The invention relates generally to buildings and more specifically to computer based techniques for evaluating the energy demand of different building massing options.

Buildings are an integral part of our everyday lives. The process of planning designing and constructing these buildings has evolved over several thousands of years. Today especially for modern facilities that are places from which to deliver complex services like healthcare facilities the steps followed to physically realize such buildings are very complicated and require a high degree of skilled labor that spans several different disciplines.

This complexity poses a huge challenge in terms of time money and other resources expended in order to build a viable facility that can be used to deliver the intended services in an efficient and profitable way. Several industries and services have met similar complexity challenges by changing their work flow and adapting it to better exploit fast growing and inexpensive computational resources. This has resulted in an increased productivity in those industries.

However the emergence of technological and computational capabilities has found limited adoption in the well established processes of building design and construction. As a result there has been little gain in overall productivity which is desperately needed today to meet the growing demand in complexity. For example it has been found that while all other non farming industries have doubled their productivity from 1964 to 2004 the building industry brethren have actually fallen behind.

While a plethora of reasons exist as to why construction productivity has not kept up with other areas it is possible that conventional methods used in the building design and construction industry are not amenable to applying technology in general and computational technology in particular. Almost all other industries have gained in productivity due to the smart adaptation of computing technology but for reasons not immediately apparent the construction industry has not seen any similar gains.

Buildings come in all different shapes and sizes and the complexity of buildings varies depending on their use. For example from many different perspectives a healthcare building such as a hospital is much more complex than an empty warehouse building. The complexity of a building becomes apparent when one tries to mathematically describe model simulate optimize and verify a building design such as the design of a hospital. In particular the mathematical description modeling simulation optimization and verification are each a complex combination of three dimensional 3D space and temporal operations. Characteristics of the 3D space include for example specifics of the building shell and core the size and layout and function of the rooms and routing of the building infrastructure. Characteristics of the temporal operations include for example the services provided within the building load on the building e.g. volume of patients and dynamic environmental conditions e.g. internal external temperature light energy cost etc .

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a computer based method for evaluating different building designs is disclosed. In one embodiment the method involves generating a first set of different building massing configurations using a shape grammar storing the generated first set of different building massing configurations in a building massing library reducing the first set of different building massing configurations according to a parameter search to form a second set of different building massing configurations the second set being a subset of the first set and using the second set of different building massing configurations to evaluate an aspect of a building system.

Computers have been used to mathematically describe model simulate and optimize buildings. However conventional computer based techniques utilize PC based computer platforms with limited computing capacity to perform very specific operations that are focused on a single issue e.g. structural performance temperature modeling or workflow optimization. Because of the inherent limitations of PC based computing resources conventional design modeling simulation and optimization operations are forced to rely on relatively crude mathematical models that can only evaluate a few design options in a reasonable amount of time. Some characteristics that add complexity to a building system are the system components do not necessarily have mathematically similar structures and may involve different scales in time or space the number of components may be large sometimes enormous components can be connected in a variety of different ways most often nonlinearly and or via a network local and system wide phenomena may depend on each other in complicated ways the behavior of the overall system can be difficult to predict from the behavior of individual components and the overall system behavior may evolve along qualitatively different pathways that may display great sensitivity to small perturbations at any stage. Because of the complexity of such building systems it is difficult if not impossible to comprehensively design model simulate or optimize such building systems on a PC based computer platform in a manner that will provide significant advances beyond the conventional techniques.

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a holistic approach to a complex building system involves using high productivity high performance HP2 computing resources to manage a complex building system from building inception through to building operation. For example HP2 computing resources are used to translate a set of customer needs to a complete virtual building design that can be used to construct a building. Further the information generated during the design of a virtual building can be used as the basis of information that is later used to fabricate commission and operate a built version of the virtual building. Because HP2 computing resources are used modeling optimization simulation and verification can be performed from a single platform on a scale which heretofore has not been applied to complex building systems. Additionally the holistic approach to complex building systems involves using a centralized database to manage all of the information related to a building system. The centralized database concept is in contrast to the conventional approach where each different discipline e.g. architects structural engineers electrical engineers etc. maintains its own proprietary database of discipline specific information.

From a high level perspective the BRP supports a series of hierarchical domains that run in a process flow from more abstract to less abstract. The hierarchical domains shown in are from more abstract to less abstract customer needs business model spatial arrangement systems integration fabrication assembly commissioning and operation . In the lifecycle of a complex building system each of the domains is dependent on the data associated with the previous domains. As such also illustrates a temporal relationship between the different domains in that certain details of a preceding domain must be specified before the process can move to the next domain. Additionally the dependencies between domains are tracked to correspond to the requirements of the previous domain.

In an embodiment the customer needs domain relates to the desired building system from an owner perspective that is what is the use of the building system e.g. healthcare hospitality etc. where the building system will be located and what are the metrics and their importance to rate the quality of the design. The business model domain relates to the types and volumes of services that will be provided to satisfy the customer needs. The business model may also support behavioral modeling of the building system and functional and space programs of the building system. The spatial arrangement domain relates to the building system as a set of building structures implementing a desired architectural parti with relative placed rooms. The systems integration domain relates to a fully detailed facility including defined 3D spaces and building infrastructure from which detailed construction documents can be derived. The fabrication domain relates to how and how many basic elements i.e. building blocks need to be fabricated to construct the building system e.g. a list of building components . The assembly domain relates to how and in which order the basic elements need to be assembled to construct the building system. The commissioning domain relates to the physical building system and its behavior. The commissioning domain may contain information that is similar to the information held in the systems integration domain but also accounts for deviations that might have occurred during the fabrication and assembly of the building system. The operation domain relates to the building system while in operation. In the operation domain a virtual model of the building system can be used in real time to optimize processes such as room staff and patient scheduling and to evaluate and adapt to unscheduled events.

In an embodiment each complex building system is designed modeled simulated optimized and verified from building inception using a pre defined set of physical building components. The pre defined set of physical building components may include for example structural components deck components and wall components. Each of the pre defined physical building components has a set of known characteristics e.g. dimensions materials of construction structural performance thermal performance that can be utilized in the various domains of the BRP to produce more rapid and accurate results. In particular the use of pre defined physical building components allows for the development and reuse of mathematical models that enable design modeling simulation optimization and validation of complex building systems. The pre defined set of physical building components can be taken into consideration early on in the building design process for example within the business model domain the spatial arrangement domain and the systems integration domain.

Performing the processes described with reference to the BRP requires computing resources well beyond what can be provided by typical PC based computer systems. In an embodiment the BRP utilizes HP2 computing resources throughout the life cycle of a complex building system. depicts an embodiment of an HP2 computer architecture in which the BRP can be implemented. In particular the HP2 computer architecture includes a high capacity networked storage system a large scale processing system and user interface devices e.g. client machines. Additionally load balancers and flow servers may be provisioned from the large scale processing system.

The user interface devices may be client machines typically desktop computers laptop computers or tablet computers on which a session can be opened to control the design flow and to view the performance results of a particular building system design. The user interface devices allow a user to provide design intent and invoke design and analysis steps. Results come in to the user interface devices as they become available. In an embodiment the user interface devices are used to access a browser based user interface of the BRP via an access network .

The high capacity networked storage system includes memory for storing the software code that is used to implement the realization engine and for storing data related to multiple different complex building systems that are managed using the BRP. In the embodiment of the high capacity network storage system includes a networked combination of storage servers that provide storage capacity on the order of Terabits of data.

In contrast to conventional techniques in which each different discipline e.g. architects structural engineers electrical engineers HVAC engineers etc. has its own internal proprietary computer networks and a database of building information the computer architecture depicted in includes a central repository for data that spans multiple different disciplines related to a complex building system. For example the data for a specific building may include data related to the customer needs the business model spatial arrangement systems integration fabrication assembly commissioning and operation. This may include information that crosses many of the disciplines that are conventionally involved in the life cycle of a building. In the embodiment of the large capacity storage system includes one or more storage servers that store the building database information and one or more servers that store the computer instructions to implement the realization engines .

In an embodiment the database servers store design information organized as follows a construction data base an analysis database a library of process knowledge and a library of design rules. The construction database may contain various system descriptions that are independent from how the systems were constructed. The analysis database may contain performance and quality results obtained through various analyses and simulations of the systems contained in the construction database. The library of process knowledge may contain information related to processes people patterns department patterns building patterns and mechanical electrical and plumbing MEP routing patterns. The library of design rules may contain building codes such as egress fire and accessibility requirements and industry best practices note that there can be different sets of design rules stored to comply with local variations of building rules . Although an example of a particular database organization is described other ways of organizing the data is possible.

The large scale processing system performs the computer processing that is necessary to implement the BRP. For example the large scale processing system performs high volume mathematical computations to implement the design modeling simulation optimization and verification of the BRP. In an embodiment the large scale processing system includes multiple servers i.e. a server farm or compute farm that each have many high speed processors e.g. on the order of thousands and up where the individual servers are connected to each other by high speed network links such as Gigabit Ethernet. Such large scale processing systems can perform on the order of Tera 10 to Peta 10 floating point operations per second Flops referred to as TFlops and PFlops respectively. Examples of large scale processing systems include the CRAY XT3 having 3 328 processing cores and the CRAY XT5 having 14 752 processing cores. In an embodiment the large scale processing system utilizes a grid computing architecture and or multi core processors to implement distributed computing according to a MapReduce framework. Although examples of the large scale processing system are described other large scale processing systems are possible.

The flow servers which can be virtual one per user interface device and design may be compute engines borrowed from the large scale processing system e.g. server farm which execute the instructions that implement the BRP design flow. In an embodiment the flow servers hold the design state of each unique design. That is the flow servers know the phase of the design cycle for a particular design. Typically the flow servers hold just enough of the design in memory to allow efficient transfer of design intent results and job submission. For computationally intensive tasks the flow servers submit processing jobs i.e. computational tasks to the load balancer and the load balancer distributes the computational tasks based on project user and task priorities.

Compute servers of the large scale processing system are used by the flow servers to perform computational intensive tasks using for example map reduced or MapReduce techniques for parallel processing. In an embodiment the compute servers are pooled among flow servers by the load balancer . The compute servers can pull large amounts of design information directly from the database servers of the high capacity network storage system and save raw results back to the storage system.

In an embodiment some or all of the computing resources excluding the user interface devices are provided as a cloud service. For example the HP2 computing resources of are provided as a cloud service within a network cloud . That is the computing resources are not owned by the owner or user of the BRP but are instead utilized and paid for by the owner or user of the BRP on an as needed basis. For example cloud services such as those provided by Amazon Web Services AWS may be utilized to implement the BRP .

The HP2 computing architecture depicted in differs from conventional industry practices in many ways. In particular the functions of control and presentation are isolated in thin client user interface devices while all compute tasks are performed in a well controlled and high performance cloud service containing both the compute and database servers. The compute machines are not allocated per type of task or discipline architects construction engineer mechanical engineer operations analyst but are pooled to serve as flow servers and compute engines. This centralized approach optimizes efficiency in that the flow servers are drawn out of the compute pool as a design session starts and the flow servers coordinate all tasks for that design session. Additionally the database servers are not organized per discipline that is they are not organized separately for each discipline e.g. one database server each for the architect the construction engineer the mechanical engineer and the operations analyst. In the architecture of high bandwidth high volume data transactions occur only between the database servers and the compute servers .

The BRP and the HP2 computing architecture as described with reference to are utilized in combination to implement a hierarchical parallel design technique from building inception to a fully defined systems integration which heretofore has not been envisioned in the field of building design. illustrates an embodiment of a parallel hierarchical design technique that starts at the customer needs e.g. building inception and runs through to a multitude of fully defined systems integrations. Using HP2 computing resources many different options can be realized and vetted in parallel within each domain from business modeling to spatial arrangement to systems integration. At each step in the process instance specific data can be stored and maintained for use in subsequent design analysis and or modification. Additionally the parallel hierarchical approach allows for the development and tracking of many different design schemes that all relate back to the same set of customer needs. In the embodiment of a database of customer needs is used to generate a set of different business models business models databases . The database of each different business model is used to generate a set of spatial arrangements which are stored as spatial arrangement databases . The database of each different spatial arrangement is used to generate a set of systems integration designs which are stored as systems integration design databases .

The parallel hierarchical process illustrated in is now described in more detail with reference to . depicts an embodiment of a user interface of the BRP that includes selectable tabs or icons for activating operations in the customer needs domain the business model domain the spatial arrangement domain the systems integration domain and the fabrication domain of the BRP. Within the customer needs domain customer needs are specified. In an embodiment customer needs are presented in a web based user interface at a client device as a formal description of customer needs. For example the formal description of customer needs is a formal description of information as known in computer science which correctly precisely and unambiguously represents certain concepts so that the customer needs can be acted upon.

In an embodiment customer needs are input to the BRP via a client device by an entity that is looking to build a building for a particular use such as a healthcare facility. For example the entity or customer may specify that it wants to provide enough acute healthcare services to residents within a specific ZIP code to meet anticipated demand. In another embodiment customer needs may reflect a project location service objectives business objectives and or a prioritization of customer needs. For example the customer needs may specify the types of services that will be provided in the building the volume of services that will be provided in the building capital investment limitations return on investment ROI requirements and or metrics to rate the quality of various design alternatives. Upon being specified the customer needs are associated with a particular project and stored in the database of the BRP.

In an embodiment customer needs related to a healthcare building system include a desired location for the building system a model of care for the building system and values of the customer. With respect to values the user interface may allow the user to rate on a sliding scale how the user values concepts such as innovation sustainability life cycle cost healthcare improvement efficiency and flexibility. In an embodiment the customer needs domain can provide the user with outputs such as a map of the desired building system location census data for the desired location and public health information such as Centers for Disease Control CDC information. In an embodiment the map may include pointers or pins that identify related facilities e.g. other healthcare facilities doctors labs etc. which are located in the vicinity of the desired location.

The information related to the customer needs can then be stored in the customer needs database of the BRP . For example the project is given a name and the project information including the location model of care value ratings map information census information and CDC information is all stored in the BRP s database under the project name. Different projects can be established with different project names and any of the user specific criteria in the customer needs domain can be changed.

With customer needs specified the process can move to the business model domain were customer needs are used as input and multiple different business models are provided as an output. In the embodiment of three different business models are provided as an output BM1 BM2 and BM3 although it should be understood that many more different business models could be generated from the same set of customer needs. In an embodiment a business model defines the program of the building needed to meet the specified customer needs. For example the business model specifies what types of services will be provided in the building and at what volume the services will be provided. The business model may also specify an initial shell of the building. Therefore the business model may include both space dimensions and time dimensions.

As illustrated in multiple different business models can be generated in parallel from the same set of customer needs. In an embodiment the generation of business models includes a computationally intensive process of design simulation optimization and validation that is able to generate and evaluate a large number of different designs in parallel. For example it is possible to design simulate optimize and validate on the order of hundreds to thousands of different iterations related to the business models in tens of minutes e.g. less than one hour from a single set of customer needs.

In an embodiment one computationally intensive operation performed in the business model domain involves behavioral simulation to determine the types and volumes of services that should be provided by a particular building. Behavioral simulations are well suited for the study of the processes that underlie formulation and implementation of a business model. For example behavioral simulations may involve measuring variables at multiple levels controlling or measuring the context dealing with historical facts capturing process differences across issues and linking processes to outcomes. The behavioral simulations performed in the business model domain are logically linked to the resulting design construction and operation of the building.

Throughout the business model domain the BRP tracks dependencies back to the customer needs so that there is a direct relationship between the customer needs and the business models that are generated to meet the customer needs. A change in the customer needs can be propagated to the business model domain and changes can be made to the business model as needed to meet customer needs. Additionally already generated business models can be evaluated in light of changes to the customer needs. Further each instance of each different business model is uniquely stored in the database so that each instance can be independently accessed and modified. Unique storage of each instance of a business model allows individual business models to be accessed evaluated and or modified without affecting other business models that correspond to the same set of customer needs.

In an embodiment the business model identifies the service lines e.g. emergency care well care imaging laboratory and or departments that are to be provided by the building system the patient load on the building system and the room and staff needs e.g. the number and types of rooms and the number and types of staff . The outputs of the business model can be provided to a user via a user interface of the BRP .

Referring back to with various different business models specified the parallel hierarchical process can move to the spatial arrangement domain where business models are used as input and multiple different spatial arrangements are provided as an output. In the embodiment of at least three different spatial arrangements are generated for each business model. As shown spatial arrangements SA11 SA12 and SA13 are generated from BM1 spatial arrangements SA21 SA22 and SA23 are generated from BM2 and spatial arrangements SA31 SA32 and SA33 are generated from BM3. Although three different spatial arrangements are generated from each business module it should be understood that many more different spatial arrangements could be generated from the same set of business models. In an embodiment a spatial arrangement defines a building system as a 3D space that includes the basic structure of the building and the placement of rooms. For example the spatial arrangement defines the approximate square footage of the building the number of floors in the building and the number types locations square footage and functionality of the rooms within the building.

In an embodiment the spatial arrangements are generated in parallel using the computational resources of the large scale processing system. For example the computing resources of the large scale processing system are used to design model simulate optimize and verify the different spatial arrangements.

In an embodiment processing in the spatial arrangement domain involves the computer assisted placement of departments and or rooms based on adjacency criteria and behavioral simulation performance. Using computer assisted placement and HP2 computing resources many different spatial arrangements can be modeled simulated optimized and verified in a relatively short period of time. For example an energy efficiency simulation of the building system may involve one thousand separate computational tasks or jobs that each require one hour to complete. Using HP2 computing resources the one thousand separate computational tasks can be processed in parallel by separate processors e.g. separate physical hardware devices reducing the time required to complete the entire task by roughly one thousand fold.

Within the spatial arrangement domain the BRP tracks dependencies back to the corresponding business models so that there is a direct relationship between the spatial arrangements the building models and ultimately the customer needs. A change in the customer needs or business model domains can be propagated to the spatial arrangement domain and changes can be made to the spatial arrangements as necessary. Further each instance of each different spatial arrangement can be uniquely stored in the database so that each instance can be independently accessed and manipulated. Because the business models and spatial arrangements are maintained in hierarchical order only changes that affect a particular hierarchical chain need to be propagated to the spatial arrangements. For example if a change is made to an aspect of BM1 only the change can be propagated to the spatial arrangements SA11 SA12 and SA13 only while the spatial arrangements that are linked to BM2 and BM3 e.g. SA21 SA22 SA23 and SA31 SA32 SA33 respectively are not affected.

In an embodiment a spatial arrangement specifies aspects of the building system related to form and shell block and stack and room placement. In an embodiment the form and shell within the spatial arrangement domain specifies parameters such as the shape e.g. architectural pattern or architectural parti and dimensions of the building system. The form and shell may also specify the orientation and location of the building on the site specified in the customer needs. From the specified form and shell various models simulations and or optimizations can be performed using the HP2 computing resources. For example using the HP2 computing resources energy efficiency simulations and optimization operations can be performed on a scale that heretofore has not been possible. depicts an embodiment of a user interface from the form and shell tab in the spatial arrangement domain that shows adjustable parameters of an energy efficiency simulation that is implemented at the form and shell level. Adjustable parameters for the simulation include the time of year e.g. month the orientation of the building and glazing to opacity ratios in different directions e.g. east west north south.

In an embodiment block and stack within the spatial arrangement domain specifies how departmental blocks and circulation elements are placed within the specified form and shell of the building system. For example the block and stack defines how departmental blocks are configured relative to each other in the horizontal direction and how departmental blocks are configured or stacked relative to each other in the vertical direction e.g. between different floors of a multistory building . From the specified block and stack various models simulations and or optimizations can be performed using the HP2 computing resources. For example operations may include interactive departmental distance exploration behavioral simulation with department distances and generation of individual departmental blocks. depicts an embodiment of a user interface from the block and stack tab of the spatial arrangement domain that shows the output of a simulation to determine travel distances and times between certain departments given a particular block and stack.

In an embodiment room placement within the spatial arrangement domain specifies the locations of specific rooms within a building system having a specific block and stack arrangement. From the specified room placement various models simulations and or optimizations can be performed using the HP2 computing resources. For example operations may include interactive room distance exploration behavioral simulation with room distances and egress design rule checking depict user interfaces from the room placement tab of the spatial arrangement domain. In particular depicts certain adjustable criteria for room placement and depicts different room placement designs that are generated based on a given set of criteria.

Referring back to with various different spatial arrangements generated and stored the process can move to the systems integration domain where spatial arrangements are used as input and multiple different systems integration designs are provided as an output. In an embodiment a systems integration design defines the 3D spaces of a building and the infrastructure of the building. For example the systems integration design for a building defines the locations in three dimensions i.e. 3D spaces of the infrastructure elements of the building system. The building infrastructure specified in the systems integration design may include for example the location and specifications of mechanical electrical and plumbing MEP systems information technology IT safety and security elements and lighting. In the systems integration designs the locations of the building infrastructure elements are fully defined and integrated into the 3D spaces of the building system. In an embodiment the systems integration designs are generated in parallel using the computational resources of the large scale processing system to design model simulate optimize and verify the different systems integration designs.

In the embodiment of at least three different systems integrations are generated for each spatial arrangement. As shown systems integration designs SI111 SI112 SI113 are generated for spatial arrangement SA11 systems integration designs SI121 SI122 and SI123 are generated for spatial arrangement SA12 systems integration designs SI131 SI132 and SI133 are generated for spatial arrangement SA13 and so on for a total of twenty seven different systems integration designs. Although three different systems integration designs are generated for each spatial arrangement it should be understood that many more different systems integration designs could be generated from the same set of spatial arrangements. As illustrated in a large number of design options can be generated from the same set of customer needs. Further the computational task of designing modeling simulating optimizing and verifying all of the different design options can grow to be quite large quite fast. Hence the use of HP2 computing resources along with a centralized BRP is key to enabling the parallel hierarchical design technique.

In an embodiment the process of going from a set of customer needs to a systems integration design is supported by a unified data model that is maintained by the BRP . illustrates an example of a unified data model that is used by the BRP in the design modeling simulation optimization and verification of a computer building system. As illustrated in the unified data model includes a behavioral hierarchy a spatial hierarchy and a physical hierarchy .

In an embodiment the behavioral hierarchy defines the operational and business processes from single activities by individuals in dedicated rooms using specific equipment to processes in departments processes in service lines or business units to a building wide operational model. The behavioral description can have various degrees of abstraction. For example a department can be described as a single activity incurring costs and producing revenue towards an activity handling patients taking time incurring costs and producing revenue or an activity of staff handling patients requiring specific equipment. Besides the human behavioral description there can also be behavioral descriptions for non human elements such as for example energy light and water. In the behavioral hierarchy ranges from activity to process to service to building operations with each level in the behavioral hierarchy being more abstract than its predecessor.

In an embodiment the spatial hierarchy describes how the volume of a building is organized. For example a building has stories each story has departmental blocks and corridors departmental blocks have rooms hallways and circulation spaces rooms contain furniture fixtures equipment FFE elements. Spatial descriptions can have various degrees of abstraction. For example a building can be described from a vague buildable volume a volume dictated by the site physical constraints legal constraints and owner desires towards the concept of an architectural parti describing a building configuration e.g. an atrium versus a spine towards a description of the major horizontal and vertical circulation areas towards a global allocation of departments into various sections of the building towards the exact location of every room and corridor in the building. In the spatial hierarchy ranges from room layout to department layout to block and stack layout to building layout with each level in the spatial hierarchy being more abstract than its predecessor.

The physical hierarchy describes how the physical building will be composed from a list of predefined building components. In the physical hierarchy ranges from material to elements to systems to buildings with each level in the physical hierarchy being more abstract than its predecessor. For example the building elements may include a set of predefined physical components such as interior walls exterior walls floor panels roof panels bathroom pods aggregate equipment wall floor modules equipment components and pods utility frames rebar cages for concrete structures metal and concrete floor assemblies structural steel and utility systems. In an embodiment certain aspects of the building components such as dimensions performance characteristics aesthetic ratings environmental concerns cost product life etc. are known in advance and used as desired in the different domains of the BRP . As stated above the use of predefined building components each with known characteristics allows for the development and reuse of mathematical models to design model simulate optimize and verify complex building systems.

For each of the data hierarchies and at each hierarchical level there is both an abstract description and one or more structural descriptions. That is within the unified data model an object is described as consisting of a set of connected instances of objects of a lower level. For example a process of a patient coming in for a regular exam could be described as a connected graph of individual activities involving different people and occurring at different locations. The unified data model may be used by the BRP in the design simulation optimization and or verification operations.

A parallel hierarchical design technique has been described with reference to . As explained above the parallel hierarchical design technique uses a centralized BRP and an HP2 computing architecture to process many different business models spatial arrangements and systems integration designs in parallel and in a hierarchical fashion that maintains design dependencies. An embodiment of a technique for generating a systems integration design from a set of customer needs is now described in more detail with reference to . In particular is a process flow diagram of a computer based technique for generating a systems integration design from a set of customer needs. The technique utilizes a highly iterative computer based process loop that relies on computationally intensive simulation optimization and verification operations performed by HP2 computing resources to implement a design process that heretofore has not been envisioned and could not have been accomplished using a conventional PC based computer system and conventional building design processes including discipline specific proprietary databases.

At block customer needs are specified. For example the customer needs are specified through a user interface that queries a user to input customer needs according to a specific functional description. Examples of information processed at the customer needs domain have been described above.

At block additional information such as information related to best practices including building and or operational flow and building codes may be entered as part of the customer needs. For example there may be location specific and or customer specific best practices and building codes that should be incorporated into the design from the building inception. The customer needs including best practices and building codes are stored in the database as described above.

At block at least one business model is generated in response to the customer needs. In an embodiment the business model specifies what services the building is to offer and at what volume the services are to be offered. In the case of a customer looking to provide acute healthcare services to the residents of a particular ZIP code the business model may define the type and volume of acute healthcare services that should be provided to meet anticipated demand. At block the behavior of one or more of the business models is simulated. In an embodiment a behavioral simulation uses workflow modeling to simulate how the specified services could be provided. For example a simulation could compare people and process workflow patterns with space patterns to determine how a proposed business model would perform. The results of the behavioral simulations can be output in the form of performance metrics for example as graphs or ratings of such parameters as patient wait times machine utilization number of staff required staff utilization space utilization energy efficiency etc. Various different parameters can be used to evaluate the desirability of business models based on the behavioral simulation.

At block the results of the behavioral simulations can be evaluated to see if the customer needs have been met. This can be a manual process which includes direct human interaction an automatic process no human interaction which is based on preprogrammed criteria or a combination thereof. At block it is also possible to modify the customer needs and or the business model. A modification of the customer needs and or business model can be propagated downstream in the flow including for example the behavioral simulation.

At block once the behavioral simulation has shown that a particular business model meets the customer needs the business model can be put through a computer based optimization process. For example the computer based optimization process can run through a large number of design alternatives to optimize certain aspects of the building design. In an embodiment an optimization process attempts to optimize areas of importance that are specified in the customer needs. For example if the customer needs place a high value on worker convenience then designs that minimize worker walking distances may be favored. Likewise if the customer needs place a high value on energy efficiency then designs that minimize the need for artificial light and HVAC may be favored. Other criteria for optimization may include Return on Investment ROI capital expense operating expense patient wait time or any combination thereof.

In a complex building system such a hospital the customer needs will specify a wide range of design priorities that can only be optimized through a multidimensional analysis of a large number of design variables. The multidimensional analysis of a large number of design variables is computationally processed by the HP2 computing resources as described with reference to .

Once a business model has been optimized at block the optimized business model is put through a validation process. The validation process checks to see if a particular business model meets particular design rules e.g. design rule checking and or to see if the business module meets the specified customer needs. The process of generating a new business model or modifying an already existing business model behaviorally simulating the new business model optimizing the new business model and validating the new business model can be run through multiple iterations before the design moves to the spatial arrangement domain.

At block each validated business model can be used as input to generate one or more spatial arrangements. As described above a spatial arrangement may specify the form and shell of a building system the block and stack arrangement of the building system and the room placement. The spatial arrangement may be simulated and or optimized as described using the HP2 computing resources. At blocks and the spatial arrangement can be processed through an iterative process of verification and modification. For example the verification operation may involve design rule checking and the modification may involve adjusting one or more parameters of the spatial arrangement.

At block each verified spatial arrangement can be used as input to generate one or more systems integration designs. As described above the systems integration design may specify the 3D spaces and infrastructure of the building system. In the systems integration domain the systems integration design may be simulated and optimized as desired using the HP2 computing resources. At blocks and the spatial integration design can be processed through an iterative process of verification and modification. For example the verification operation may involve design rule checking and the modification may involve adjusting one or more parameters of the systems integration design. The output of the systems integration design can be used to implement operations in the manufacturing assembly commissioning and operation domains as represented by blocks and respectively.

Although the BRP has been described above in the context of a healthcare building such as a hospital the above described BRP and associated techniques are applicable to other buildings and building systems. For example the BRP and associated techniques may be applicable to hospitality buildings e.g. hotels apartment condominium buildings and transportation facilities e.g. airports . Additionally a building system may include one or more buildings that can be detached from each other partially attached to each other or fully attached to each other. For example a building system may be a building or a set of buildings that are located at the same physical site location and that are intended to fulfill a set of customer needs.

In an embodiment the BRP allows the generation and optimization of a virtual building based on user needs and a comprehensive set of rules including building codes and best practices in the corresponding industries. Users create virtual buildings using a design flow that morphs the design gradually from a very abstract description for example serve an area defined by a set of ZIP codes with enough acute care capacity to satisfy demand to a fully detailed description containing architectural intent engineering details and construction details that leave no ambiguity as to how the building should be built and how the building system will perform. Once a virtual building is complete within the BRP detailed operation and construction documents can be generated by the BRP in various industry standard formats. In an embodiment a virtual building system maintained by the BRP contains detailed information about the building and all its subsystems and about its use and its performance along many dimensions such as operating costs construction costs thermal comfort level daylight usage sustainability operational efficiency patient experience. The virtual building system maintained by the BRP is detailed and accurate enough that it can be used to unambiguously generate detailed construction documents for the construction of a real building system having a performance that matches the performance of the virtual building system.

In an embodiment the virtual building system that is maintained by the BRP can be used to predict the implications of changes during the lifetime of the building. In an embodiment the virtual building system includes descriptions of the building structure the processes and service lines the mechanical electrical plumbing MEP subsystems the information technology IT subsystem the thermal energy behavior the seismic behavior the light behavior and the sound behavior. In an embodiment the virtual building system maintained in the BRP differs from current practices in the following ways Besides the description of the physical building the virtual building system also includes the description of the purpose and operation of the building as both the building and the processes need to be designed and measured together. The information about the building is partitioned differently. Traditionally information is grouped per domain building structure mechanical system electrical system with a loose coupling between various domains. This is done because the toolsets for the different domains differ and because the domain specific information resides with different companies. Here information of all domains is grouped by sequence in which design decisions are made and information becomes available. Unlike current building information modeling BIM practices where the overall architecture is a federated network of isolated systems each holding a part of the golden design information and exchanging a minimum information with each other using standard protocols on a need basis the approach described herein is a star configuration where different systems communicate exclusively through the BRP. The golden design information resides in a central database and the satellite systems are used as agents that change the central golden information and report back.

Although the operations of the method s herein are shown and described in a particular order the order of the operations of each method may be altered so that certain operations may be performed in an inverse order or so that certain operations may be performed at least in part concurrently with other operations. In another embodiment instructions or sub operations of distinct operations may be implemented in an intermittent and or alternating manner.

It should also be noted that at least some of the operations for the methods may be implemented using software instructions stored on a non transitory computer useable storage medium for execution by a computer. As an example an embodiment of a computer program product includes a computer useable storage medium to store a computer readable program that when executed on a computer causes the computer to perform operations as described herein.

Furthermore embodiments of at least portions of the invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer usable or non transitory computer readable medium providing computer executable instructions or program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description a non transitory computer usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain or store the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device.

The computer useable or computer readable medium can be an electronic magnetic optical electromagnetic infrared or semiconductor system or apparatus or device . Examples of a computer readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory magnetic tape a removable computer diskette a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include a compact disk with read only memory CD ROM a compact disk with read write CD R W and a digital video disk DVD .

In an embodiment the above described functionality is performed by a computer or computers which executes computer readable instructions. depicts a computer that includes a processor memory and a communications interface . The processor may include a multifunction processor and or an application specific processor. Examples of processors include the PowerPC family of processors by IBM and the x86 family of processors by Intel such as the Xeon family of processors and the Intel X5650 processor. The memory within the computer may include for example storage medium such as read only memory ROM flash memory RAM and a large capacity permanent storage device such as a hard disk drive. The communications interface enables communications with other computers via for example the Internet Protocol IP . The computer executes computer readable instructions stored in the storage medium to implement various tasks as described above.

As described above the business model BM domain produces certain outputs such as the building square footage needed to provide the desired services which are used within the spatial arrangement SA domain to define certain aspects of the building system. For example within the spatial arrangement domain certain physical aspects of the building system are defined including the building form and shell the building block and stack and the room placement.

The building system form and shell can also be referred to as the building massing configuration. As used herein the building massing configuration is at least partially defined by the footprint shape of the building system the footprint dimensions and the number of floors of the building.

In reality there is almost an infinite number of different building massing configurations that can be employed to meet the needs of a particular business model. That is multiple different building massing configurations can support the desired use of the building e.g. types and volume of services to be provided within a healthcare building system. Although multiple different building massing configurations may meet the needs of a particular business model the massing configuration of a building has an effect on energy use. For example a long and narrow building massing configuration will have more exposed surface area than a square building of the same square footage. Among many factors the differences in exposed surface area can have a large effect on the cost to heat and or cool the building. Therefore it is desirable to be able to evaluate many different building massing configurations in terms of energy efficiency e.g. the energy use of the building in order to intelligently select a building massing configuration.

The energy use of a building can be characterized by running an energy use simulation. Various computer based energy use simulation programs are available including for example Building Loads Analysis and System Thermodynamics BLAST DOE 2 eQUEST ESP r and EnergyPlus. A widely accepted energy use simulation program is the U.S. Department of Energy s EnergyPlus simulation program. EnergyPlus takes into consideration a large list of parameters to simulate the energy use of a building. Parameters considered in an EnergyPlus simulation may include for example information about the building site climate information building construction specifics building operating schedules operating loads and building massing configuration. Some specific examples of simulation parameters include location coordinates climate information operating schedules surface construction elements thermal zone description geometry advanced surface concepts detailed ground heat transfer room air modules internal gains people lights other internal zone equipment daylighting exterior energy use equipment and airflow. A detailed description of EnergyPlus input and output data can be found in the document Input Output Reference The Encyclopedic Reference to EnergyPlus Input and Output Oct. 6 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein.

As the complexity of a building increases the computational requirements of an energy simulation also increase. For example an EnergyPlus simulation of a four story 250 000 square foot building of average complexity can take a single processor computer on the order of 2 8 hours to complete e.g. model setup and run time. The computing power and time required to run EnergyPlus simulations can make it impractical to evaluate a large number e.g. 10 000 30 000 of different building massing configurations early on in the building design process. Without a way to efficiently evaluate the energy use of a large number of building massing configurations some desirable massing configurations may never come to the fore in the design process. Therefore there is a need to be able to quickly evaluate the energy use of a large number e.g. 10 000 30 000 of different building massing configurations early on in the design process so that energy use and hence energy efficiency can be integrated into the building design process.

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention formulas are derived in advance for calculating the energy use of different building massing configurations so that a large number of different building massing configurations can be quickly evaluated for energy efficiency early on in the building design process. In an embodiment the formulas are a function of a limited set of parameters that are directly related to the building massing configuration. For example the formulas are a function of the shape of the building footprint the dimensions of the building and the number of stories of the building. Because the formulas are a function of a limited set of parameters the energy use of a large number of building massing configurations can be quickly calculated for energy use evaluation early on in the design process. Additionally the formulas are normalized to a reference building such that the energy use of each different building massing configuration is compared to the same standard e.g. the reference building.

Given a set of building design parameters the predefined and normalized formulas are used in for example the Building Realization Platform BRP to calculate the energy use of multiple different building massing configurations so that the multiple different building massing configurations can be compared to each other in terms of energy use. As an example using the techniques that are described in more detail below energy use indexes of over 20 000 different building massing configurations can be calculated in less than one minute. The energy use information can then be intelligently searched and sorted to identify desirable building massing configurations. An embodiment of a technique for characterizing the energy use of multiple different building massing configurations is described below with reference to .

In an embodiment a technique for characterizing the energy use of multiple different building massing configurations is based on building dimensions that are a function of a fixed size bay where a bay defines at least a floor portion of the building. Accordingly the footprint of each building is established by a set of adjoining fixed size bays. In an embodiment each fixed size bay is a 30 30 square. Although a 30 30 square bay is described other shapes and dimensions of a fixed size bay are possible. Given 30 30 fixed size bays the footprint shape of each story of a building is a function of the 30 30 bays and can only be changed by 30 increments.

Using fixed size bays multiple different footprint shapes can be produced. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a limited number of footprint shapes have been predefined for use in characterizing energy use. Each footprint shape is formed from the fixed size bays and the footprint shapes can be selected in view of for example known footprint shapes and or commonly used architectural parti. For example the footprint shapes are footprint shapes that have practical application to healthcare buildings. depict nine different predefined footprint shapes including footprint shape R footprint shape L footprint shape Z footprint shape K footprint shape X footprint shape T footprint shape U footprint shape H and footprint shape O . Although some footprint shapes are shown other footprint shapes are possible. As shown in each footprint shape has been given a shape name for identification purposes. The set of shape names defines a shape alphabet which is represented as R L Z K X T U H O. With reference to dimensions of the footprint shapes are identified as Bx By W and H where 

A technique for characterizing the energy use of multiple different building massing configurations is now described in terms of the fixed size bay and the predefined set of footprint shapes. A first step involves modeling the energy use of a reference building. In an embodiment the building massing configuration of the reference building is defined as a square building that has a 2 bay 2 bay footprint and three stories. depicts the footprint shape of the reference building and the building massing configuration of the reference building is defined as 

With the building massing configuration of the reference building defined the energy use of the reference building is calculated. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the energy use of the reference building is calculated on an energy use per annum per square foot basis which is referred to herein as the energy use index EUI . A process for calculating the energy use index EUI of the reference building is described with reference to . The process uses the EnergyPlus simulation program to calculate the total energy use of the reference building per annum and then divides the total energy use by the total square footage of the reference building to come up with an energy use index for the reference building EUI RB.

With reference to a modeling input is generated for the reference building. The modeling input includes building massing configuration information and other information as required by the EnergyPlus program. For example the modeling input may be presented in an EnergyPlus input file IDF that also defines the simulation parameters. A number of tools are available to create EnergyPlus input files. These include for example Easy EnergyPlus ECOTECT EnergyPlugged EP GEO EP SYS EP QUICK ESP r jEPlus and EP Launch. Other techniques may also be used to create EnergyPlus input files. One technique for creating simulation input filed e.g. EnergyPlus input files is described below.

Once the modeling input is established it is provided to an EnergyPlus simulator which runs an EnergyPlus simulation to determine the total energy use of the reference building. For example the total energy use is calculated on in a per annum basis and it may be in the range of 20 40 GWh annum for a 250 000 square foot building that delivers healthcare services. The total energy use is then provided to an indexer to calculate the energy use index of the reference building EUI RB . The energy use index of the reference building EUI RB can be expressed as EUI RB total energy use per annum gross square footage The energy use index of the reference building is used as described below to normalize the simulation results for multiple different building massing configurations.

As explained above with reference to energy use is characterized with respect to a predefined set of footprint shapes. A next step in the process involves modeling the energy use of buildings that utilize each of the different pre defined footprint shapes referred to herein as shape specific modeling. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the energy use of multiple different building massing configurations is simulated for each different footprint shape and the results are used to generate a normalized energy use index nEUI for each different building massing configuration.

A process for generating normalized energy use indexes nEUIs for buildings having the footprint shape R is described with reference to . A first step in the process involves establishing the modeling input for an EnergyPlus simulation. In an embodiment the modeling input includes a set of building massing configurations in which each instance of a configuration has a different combination of configuration parameters e.g. Bx By and Ns but the same footprint shape. Note that for footprint shape R the void area dimensions W and H are not relevant e.g. essentially W 0 and H 0 and as described above the values of Bx and By represent increments of the 30 30 fixed size bay. As shown in each different shape specific building massing configuration has a unique identifier e.g. R R . . . R.

In an example the number of different shape specific building massing configurations e.g. where a shape specific building massing configuration is defined by a unique set of Bx By W H and Ns that are established as inputs is on the order of thousands e.g. 1 000 5 000 per footprint shape. For example the number of different shape specific building massing configurations is a function of the range of possible values for Bx By W H and Ns where the range of possible values for Bx By W H and Ns is selected to reflect the possible range of building massing configurations that are to be evaluated. The total number of different shape specific building massing configurations can be expressed as Total number Given these five degrees of variability the number of different shape specific building massing configurations grows rapidly for each footprint shape. For example with the following ranges set at 1 Bx 7 1 By 6 0 W 5 0 H 6 1 Ns 4 the total number of different shape specific building massing configurations for a particular footprint shape is calculated as 7 6 6 7 4 7 056 A technique for generating and managing building massing configurations is described in more detail below. In an embodiment sets of building massing configurations are pre generated for each footprint shape and stored in a building massing configuration library or massing library. For example the massing library includes building massing configurations also referred to as design patterns architectural patterns or architectural partis as described with reference to and patterns element .

For each different building massing configuration the modeling input includes the building massing configuration and other information that is required by the EnergyPlus simulator. For example the modeling input may be provided in an IDF file that defines the EnergyPlus simulation parameters. With the modeling input established and provided to the EnergyPlus simulator EnergyPlus simulations are run for each different building massing configuration. The EnergyPlus simulations can be run for example in series on a single processor machine in parallel on a multiprocessor machine or in parallel using HPHP computing resources as described above with reference to . In one implementation it is estimated that it would take approximately 40 days to run 900 different EnergyPlus simulations serially on a single processor machine approximately 2.5 days to run the same 900 EnergyPlus simulations in parallel on a 16 processor Linux server and approximately 8 hours to run the same 900 EnergyPlus simulations using HPHP computing e.g. using 50 dual processor nodes of a cloud computing resource such as Amazon Web Services AWS . As with the reference building the total energy use is calculated on for example a per annum basis and may be in the range of 1 2 GWh annum. Referring again to upon completion of an EnergyPlus simulation the total energy use for each building massing configuration e.g. R is provided to the indexer to calculate the corresponding energy use index e.g. EUI R . The energy use index of the building massing configuration is then provided to a normalizer which normalizes the energy use index by dividing the shape specific energy use index by the energy use index of the reference building. The normalized energy use index for the building massing configuration Rcan be expressed as EUI 1 EUI 1 EUI 

The operations of energy use simulation indexing and normalizing are performed for each of the different shape specific building massing configurations e.g. R R . . . Rto produce shape specific normalized energy use indexes nEUI R nEUI R . . . nEUI R . The nEUI data is stored in a shape specific database for further processing as described below.

The process described above is performed for each of the predefined shapes shown in . illustrates an embodiment of the process for generating normalized energy use indexes for buildings having the footprint shape L. In the example of the number of different L shaped building massing configurations is on the order of thousands e.g. 1 000 5 000 as described above.

With reference to for each different building massing configuration of the L shaped footprint the modeling input includes the building massing configuration and other information that is required by the EnergyPlus simulator. With the modeling input established and provided to the EnergyPlus simulator EnergyPlus simulations are run for each different building massing configuration to calculate the total energy use on for example a per annum basis. Upon completion of an EnergyPlus simulation the total energy use for each building massing configuration e.g. L is provided to the indexer to calculate the corresponding energy use index e.g. EUI L . The energy use index of the building massing configuration is then provided to a normalizer which normalizes the energy use index by dividing the shape specific energy use index by the energy use index of the reference building. The operations of energy use simulation indexing and normalizing are performed for each of the different L shape building massing configurations e.g. L L . . . Lto produce shape specific normalized energy use indexes nEUI L nEUI L . . . nEUI L . The nEUI data is stored in a shape specific database for further processing as described below.

Once the process of generating normalized energy use indexes for each footprint shape e.g. R L Z K X T U H O is completed shape specific formulas are derived from the normalized energy use index data. In an embodiment formulas are derived that define the normalized energy use index nEUI as a function of a limited set of variables related to the building massing configuration. For example the formulas define the shape specific normalized energy use indexes nEUI as a function of the parameters Bx By W H Ns and in some cases where is the angular orientation of the building e.g. relative to magnetic north.

In a first operation the shape specific normalized energy use index data is used by the shape specific nEUI formula derivation engine to derive shape specific formulas that best fit the corresponding data as a function of a limited set of variables e.g. Bx By W L Ns and . In an embodiment a formula to represent nEUI for each footprint shape may be derived by 1 plotting all of the nEUIs that were calculated during the shape specific simulations 2 observing trends e.g. energy demand trends with respect to each of the shape definition parameters e.g. Bx By W H Ns and ratio of perimeter length to footprint area 3 finding a parameter e.g. Bx By W H Ns and ratio of perimeter length to footprint area that primarily affects a general trend e.g. an energy demand trend of the plotted curve 4 finding the best formula as a function of the primary parameter to describe the general trend e.g. energy demand trends by using polynomial curve fitting or by applying knowledge of curve patterns that can be described with other means of mathematical functions 5 finding secondary tertiary and so on parameters e.g. Bx By W H Ns and ratio of perimeter length to footprint area that can be used to reduce variances of simulated values from the formula and 6 adjusting formula using terms expressed with the secondary tertiary and so on parameters. In an embodiment the formula derivation involves identifying key contributing factors e.g. Bx By W H Ns and ratio of perimeter length to footprint area that effect the energy demand of a building massing configuration. The operation of the shape specific nEUI formula derivation engine is repeated for each shape specific database.

In a next operation the nEUI base formula derivation engine derives a base formula which is common to all of the footprint shapes from the previously derived shape specific formulas. In an embodiment a nEUI base formula which is common to all of the footprint shapes may be derived by 1 finding the most common form of formula among all the formulas derived for each footprint shape 2 determining a new pattern of formula base formula that generally describes the nEUIs of all footprint shapes and 3 re establishing formulas for each footprint shape using the base formula to describe nEUI trends of each footprint shape.

In a next operation the shape specific correction factor derivation engine derives a correction factor for each footprint shape to calibrate the base normalized energy use index formula. In an embodiment the correction factor corrects for variations related to the number of stories of the buildings the void area dimensions and in at least one case the orientation of the building in degrees relative to for example true north.

The nEUI formulas for each footprint shape which are expressed using the common base formula may be further improved by 1 plotting and comparing a calculated nEUI curve with a simulated result curve 2 finding parameters e.g. Bx By W H Ns and ratio of perimeter length to footprint area that can make the calculated nEUI curve closer to the simulated result curve and 3 introducing correction terms that are functions of those parameters to reduce the error percentage to within an acceptable range e.g. within 5 of the actual values.

In an embodiment each shape specific formula for calculating the normalized energy use index nEUI includes a base formula and a correction factor and can be expressed generally as EUI shape base formula correction factor

The base formula and or correction factor may include intermediary factors and or coefficients. Examples of intermediary factors include 

Examples of shape specific formulas that have been derived for calculating the normalized energy use indexes nEUIs are provided in the Appendix. The examples include formulas for single storey two storey and three plus storey buildings having footprint shapes R L Z K X T U H and O. The Appendix also includes alternate formulas that have been derived for buildings having more than two stories.

The shape specific formulas including corresponding coefficients for calculating the normalized energy use indexes nEUIs are stored in the shape specific nEUI formula databases for use in the Building Realization Platform BRP as described below. It should be noted that in an embodiment the operations described with reference to are preliminary operations that are performed in advance of the use of the building realization program in the BRP.

Use of the shape specific formulas to characterize the energy use of multiple different building massing configurations early on in the building design process is now described with reference to . When utilized within the Building Realization Platform BRP described above with reference to different building massing configurations are provided to a massing configuration evaluator . In an embodiment the different building massing configurations are provided to the massing configuration evaluator as a set of parameters that can be defined as specific finite values or value ranges. For example the set of parameters may include 

As described herein the magnitude of the calculated normalized energy use indexes nEUIs is an indication of the energy efficiency of a particular building massing configuration relative to the reference building. Therefore a relatively large nEUI indicates that the particular building massing configuration is less energy efficient e.g. a building with the massing configuration would require more energy to operate and a relatively small nEUI indicates that the particular building massing configuration is more energy efficient e.g. a building with the massing configuration would require less energy to operate. Because the energy use indexes nEUIs are all normalized to the same reference building the normalized energy use indexes nEUIs can be compared to each other as a metric of the relative energy efficiency between different building massing configurations.

An example operation of the above described technique for characterizing the energy use of multiple different building massing configurations is now described with reference to . In the example application the set of massing configuration parameters is as follows 

Given the above set of building massing configuration parameters the massing configuration evaluator calculates normalized energy use indexes nEUIs for 24 693 different building massing configurations. In an embodiment all of the normalized energy use indexes nEUIs were calculated in less than one minute using the predefined formulas. The time frame of minutes is orders of magnitude less than the days weeks or months that would be required to run a different EnergyPlus simulation for each one of the different building massing configurations.

The massing configuration evaluator is configured to allow the set of normalized energy use indexes e.g. all 24 693 nEUIs to be searched sorted and or manipulated in various ways to allow the data to be presented in a manner that is useful to the user. For example the user may request a ranking of the 10 building massing configurations with the lowest normalized energy use index.

Techniques for generating and managing building massing configurations are now described with reference to . In an embodiment sets of building massing configurations are generated using a shape grammar approach. With reference to an initial set of building massing configuration primitives is generated from a base solid mass and the application of at least one void object . The base solid is a three dimensional rectangular mass having non zero x y and z axis dimensions. A set of rectangular masses can be generated by varying the x y and z axis dimensions e.g. parametrically in one bay increments where a bay is a fixed size e.g. 30 30 and in one floor increments where a floor is a fixed size e.g. 15 . Other building massing configuration primitives can be generated by applying a set of rules referred to as a shape grammar to the rectangular mass. In the embodiment of the set of rules involves applying at least one three dimensional void object to the rectangular mass in this case a rectangular void object although void object with other shapes are possible. As shown in multiple different void objects can be applied to a rectangular mass. Using a parametric shape grammar e.g. varying the x and y dimensions by one bay and the z dimension by one floor height void objects are applied to a rectangular mass to form a set of building massing primitives. For example one two three or four voids can be applied to a mass to form different building massing configurations. In the embodiment of the shape grammar is applied in a manner that generates building massing configurations having the footprint shapes as described above with reference to . In particular the building massing configuration shape primitives which are referred to herein as building letters of a building alphabet include the shapes R not shown H K L O R T U X and Z. In an embodiment applying values to the x y and z dimensions of the rectangular mass and to the void object s that correspond to realistic building sizes can result in thousands of different building massing configurations e.g. 20 000 to 30 000 different building massing configurations.

Although a building alphabet with a particular set of footprint shapes e.g. the letters of the alphabet is described other shapes may be included in the building alphabet and the shape geometry can be modified by changing the shape grammar.

Application of a set of rules in the shape grammar to a particular building massing configuration can result in thousands of different building massing configurations for each building letter e.g. each footprint shape. depicts a graphical user interface GUI that graphically displays building massing configurations for a rectangle footprint shape. The graphical user interface of helps to illustrate the scale of the number of different building massing configurations that can be generated for a single footprint shape. The generated set of building massing configurations can be stored in a database for fast and flexible access by the BRP. depicts a graphical user interface of entries in a building alphabet database that is generated using the shape grammar as described with reference to . As shown in the building alphabet database includes 24 693 different building massing configurations with configurations 1 33 being currently displayed. The information in the graphical user interface is similar to that described above with reference to .

Given the extremely large number of different building massing configurations that can be generated it is desirable to be able to manipulate the database to reduce the set of building massing configurations to better suit a particular building project. In an embodiment the building alphabet database is searchable by any of the column fields. For example a search can be run to find only those shapes that will fit on a particular building site having specific x and y dimensions. Such a search or pre filtering can be performed by specifying the limits of the bounding box dimensions Bx and By. Other criteria e.g. area volume aspect ratio nEUI can be used to pre filter the building massing configurations. depicts a graphical user interface that includes a search window that allows certain parameters of a search to be specified. For example the search window allows any of the column parameters of a building massing database to be specified and searched according to the specification. In the example of the search criteria specifies alphabet letters L and O area between 100 000 and 150 000 sq. ft. and having an nEUI of less than 0.6. In an embodiment a pre filtered set of building massing configurations is used to populate a building massing library for a specific building project. In other embodiments the building massing library can be unfiltered such that the entire set of generated building massing configurations is available for evaluation in the context of the building design.

While the building alphabet provides a certain set of building massing configurations a more complex set of building massing configurations can be generated by combining different primitives e.g. building letters from the building alphabet. illustrates the application of shape grammar to the building alphabet to form more complex building massing configurations referred to herein as building words. As illustrated across the top row of applying a rule of H L results in the building word depicted in the upper right corner of . Rows 2 5 of illustrate other rules in the shape grammar e.g. H L R H R H T and H U. In an embodiment the shape grammar is parametrically applied to form multiple building massing configurations of the same building word. In an embodiment the shape grammar is applied to a pre filtered set of building alphabet elements. For example a pre filtered set of H building elements may include 10 different building massing configurations and a pre filtered set of L building elements may include 20 different building massing configurations. The total number of possible building words is the product of the H and L building elements e.g. 10 20 200. That is 200 different configurations of the HL H L building word are generated from the building letters.

In an embodiment the shape grammar is configured to require certain dimensions of two different building shapes to match or to be within a certain range of each other. For example with reference to the HL building word the shape grammar may require that a particular dimension or dimensions of the H and L elements match so that the different stories of the building massing configuration have at least a portion of their respective footprints that are in common. The shape grammar may be modified updated etc. as desired to trigger the generation of different building massing configurations.

As described above with reference to the building alphabet generated building massing configurations in the building word form can also be stored in a database. depicts a graphical user interface of different building massing configurations that are formed by a combination of the building letters. As shown in the database includes 139 different building massing configurations having a particular combination of building letters of which building massing configurations 1 35 are displayed. Building massing configurations 1 35 include RU R U building words and RT R T building words. The graphical user interface includes an id column a name column an alphabet column an area column and an EUI column. The id column associates the building word with a unique identifier the name column associates the building word with a unique building name the alphabet column indicates which primitives from the building alphabet were used to form the building word the area column is the total area in terms of floor space of the building word e.g. assuming each letter represents a different floor and the word EUI represents the combined normalized EUI nEUI of the building word where the word EUI is calculated on a proportional basis e.g. relative to footprint area using the nEUIs from the corresponding building primitives. For example the nEUI for building word id 1 is calculated as area R 168 nEUI R 168 225 000 area U 208 nEUI U 208 225 000.

As described above building massing configurations can be generated and referred to as building letters of a building alphabet or building words. In each case a particular building massing configuration is one contiguous mass e.g. a single contiguous building. In another embodiment a shape grammar can be applied to the building alphabet and or to building words to generate multi building configurations in which the buildings are not physically connected to each other. Keeping with the building alphabet and building word taxonomy multiple building massing configurations can be associated with each other to form a building sentence. In an embodiment the association of multiple buildings into a building sentence is a physical association or nearness. However the association of multiple buildings into a building sentence may be a functional association instead of or in addition to the physical association. A building sentence is applicable to a multi building complex such as a healthcare services complex. illustrates the application of shape grammar to a set of building words to generate building sentences e.g. HL HL. As illustrated across the top row of two HL H L building words are associated with each other to form a building sentence. In the embodiment of the two HL building words HL HL are associated with each other in that the buildings are understood to be located together at the same physical site at a known spacing and in the orientation as shown. Building sentences can also be generated from a building letter and a building word or from a building letter and another building letter e.g. R U.

In an embodiment the building massing generation system is a component of the Building Realization Program BRP which is implemented through a combination of software and hardware such as computer executable instructions stored in memory and executed by the computer of . In an embodiment the generated building massing configurations are stored in the building massing library and can be used to support other functions in the Building Realization Program BRP . For example the building massing configurations in the building massing library can be used for energy analysis as described in detail above structural sizing e.g. ETABS structural detailing e.g. Telka block and stack and fa ade generation.
