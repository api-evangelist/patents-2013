The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates in general to mixing vessels and in particular to mixing vessels with easily interchangeable baffles.

Mixing vessels may be used in a variety of commercial and industrial processes. A variety of materials may be mixed in a mixing vessel. Different materials and different processes may require different amounts of shear and flow patterns to properly mix the ingredients maintain the ingredients in suspension and circulate the ingredients within the vessel. The size shape location orientation and rotational speed of the mixing vessel impeller may be factors in producing specific flow patterns tailored for a particular product.

A mixing vessel without baffles may not produce enough shear or turbulence to mix the ingredients. Therefore many mixing vessels may include fixed baffles that may influence the mixing action and flow patterns. The number size location and geometry of baffles may vary widely generating both localized high shear between the baffle and impeller blades and generating circulating currents that may promote the homogeneity and suspension of ingredients. A configuration of impeller and baffles that may be optimized to produce one product may be unsuitable for a different product.

The flow patterns and circulating currents may also be influenced by the shape of the vessel itself. Typically a vessel having a concave bottom may produce better vertical dispersion because the liquid may be slung out radially from the impeller and may be gently turned upward when the liquid moves toward the vessel wall. Flat bottomed mixing vessels may not do this function nearly as well and may have very poor flow patterns. Acceptable flow patterns and methods of mixing a material may be discovered by adding and experimenting with various types of baffles.

In the past new mixing vessels with optimized geometry were constructed for and exclusively dedicated to a specific process or product. As an alternative existing plain mixing vessels that were at first completely unsuitable for a particular process were retrofitted by adding permanently welded baffles. In such mixing vessels it may be relatively easy and common practice to make small variations in the mixing action and fine tune it to slightly different processes by changing the impeller or its rotational speed. Changing the baffling may have a much larger effect but it may be costly to construct a new mixing vessel each time one wishes to alter a baffle arrangement. It may also be costly to remove welded baffles and reweld new baffles in a mixing vessel.

In a manufacturing scenario where more than one product is made for instance the manufacturer may set up a single production line and simply switch baffles in the mixing vessels. In a research and development scenario the effect that each element of geometry has on the mixing process itself or the effect that each element of geometry has on the quality of the product being produced may be explored using many physical variations. Baffles that are easily removed and replaced in a mixing vessel may save time money and storage space for multiple variations of mixing vessels and simplify cleaning and repair of baffles. Thus a need exists for mixing vessels having easily interchangeable baffles.

In some cases such as laboratory bench top and glassware size vessels a mixing vessel having the desired baffle arrangement may not be available commercially. Formulations and mixing procedures for products may be developed and tested in both small and medium scale laboratory mixers before transitioning to high rate production in full size mixing vessels. A manufacturing plant that uses 3000 gallon baffled mixers may have a laboratory where procedures are developed in quart or gallon sized mixers. Thus there is a need to be able to adapt standard laboratory glassware mixing vessels for instance into scale models of larger mixing vessels by adding baffle kits.

An aspect of the invention may be a mixing vessel including a container having a bottom. The bottom may include a removable plate fixed thereto. The removable plate may include at least one slot formed therein. A baffle may be inserted in at least one slot.

Another aspect of the invention may be a flexible baffle insert including a retaining band having inner and outer opposing surfaces and a plurality of baffles extending inwardly from the inner surface of the retaining band. Each baffle may include first and second edges proximate the inner surface of the retaining band. The first proximate edge may form a support joint with the inner surface of the retaining band and the second proximate edge may be displaced inwardly from the first proximate edge.

A further aspect of the invention may be a mixing vessel including a container having a bottom and a generally circular side wall and a flexible baffle insert disposed in the container.

Another aspect of the invention may be a method of making a flexible baffle insert. The method may include providing a thin flexible material having a retaining band and a plurality of baffles where the retaining band and the baffles are substantially coplanar. The related method may include bending the baffles along an edge such that the baffles are angled with respect to the retaining band.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the exemplary embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

For clarity in the side walls of container are not shown. is a perspective view of a container bottom having a removable plate with baffles as shown in . is a perspective view of a container bottom having a removable plate with baffles as shown in . Removable plate may be fixed to bottom with fasteners .

As best seen in each baffle may include a first edge proximate the inner surface of the retaining band and a second edge proximate the inner surface of the retaining band . First edge may be more proximate inner surface than second edge . First proximate edge may form a support joint with the inner surface of the retaining band . Second proximate edge may be displaced inwardly from the first proximate edge . The displacement of the second proximate edge away from the first proximate edge may provide a gap or open area between a portion of baffle and the side wall of container . Gap may be helpful in some mixing processes.

Each baffle may include an upper edge that forms an angle B with respect to the inner surface of the retaining band . In the angle B is about 90 degrees for example. However angle B may be other than ninety degrees. Each baffle may include a lower edge see also that forms an angle D between the lower edge of the baffle and the inner surface of the retaining band . When angles B and D are the same the baffle will be vertically oriented.

In the exemplary embodiment shown in angle D is larger than angle B such that baffle is slanted. In the Figures in an exemplary embodiment angle B is about 90 degrees and angle D is about 110 degrees. Other exemplary values for angles B and D may be used. is a view along the line of showing the slant of baffle in a different perspective. Angle C in is about 80 degrees for example. Other exemplary values for angle C may be used.

If one desires a baffle insert with baffles that are not vertical then one may further bend the baffles . One may further bend baffle such that upper edge of the baffle forms an angle B with respect to the retaining band that is different than an angle D of a lower edge of the baffle with respect to the retaining band . show an embodiment where angle D is larger than angle B.

The retaining band may be bent into a curve approximately as shown in . This curve may have a radius that is larger than the radius of the interior of the mixing vessel . The retaining band may be flexed into a circular shape by squeezing together the pair of tabs disposed on opposite ends of the retaining band . Insert may be inserted into a mixing vessel and the pair of tabs released. As the retaining band expands it grips the side wall as shown in . In an iterative process the insert may be removed its curvature may be adjusted and it may be reinserted into vessel until no gaps are visible between the retaining band and the side wall .

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
