title: Inferring social groups through patterns of communication
abstract: Software authenticates the user of a social networking service which maintains one or more lists of contacts associated with the user that can be used by the user to selectively share content. The software ascertains a proposed group of contacts from at least one of the lists. The user and members of the proposed group are related by a plurality of communications and the communications are associated with one or more attributes including at least one of geographic locations associated with the communication, time of communication, or medium of communication. The software presents the proposed group of contacts to the user, with a recommendation that the user create a new list of contacts associated with the user from the proposed group of contacts. The software creates the new list of contacts from the proposed group, if the user indicates acceptance of the recommendation.

As a user of an online social networking service accumulates contacts or friends the task of managing the content shared with them becomes more difficult.

For example the user might want to share an off color visual sight gag with the members of his her bowling team but not with his her elderly parents.

Some online social networking services allow a user to manually create groups of contacts for selective sharing. However such a manual task becomes burdensome when it involves a large number of contacts especially when performed using a mobile computing device such as a smartphone.

Some implementations involve a processor executed method. The method might be performed by the software for an online social networking service. According to the method the software authenticates the user of a social networking service which maintains one or more lists of contacts associated with the user that can be used by the user to selectively share content. The software ascertains a proposed group of contacts from at least one of the lists. The user and members of the proposed group are related by a plurality of communications and the communications are associated with one or more attributes including at least one of geographic locations associated with the communication time of communication or medium of communication. The software presents the proposed group of contacts to the user with a recommendation that the user create a new list of contacts associated with the user from the proposed group of contacts. The software creates the new list of contacts from the proposed group if the user indicates acceptance of the recommendation.

Other implementations involve an apparatus namely computer readable storage media that persistently store a program. The program might be part of the software for an online social networking service. The program authenticates the user of a social networking service which maintains one or more lists of contacts associated with the user that can be used by the user to selectively share content. The program ascertains a proposed group of contacts from at least one of the lists. The user and members of the proposed group are related by a plurality of communications and the communications are associated with one or more attributes including at least one of geographic locations associated with the communication time of communication or medium of communication. The program presents the proposed group of contacts to the user with a recommendation that the user create a new list of contacts associated with the user from the proposed group of contacts. The program creates the new list of contacts from the proposed group if the user indicates acceptance of the recommendation.

Still other implementations involve another processor executed method. This method might also be performed by the software for an online social networking service. According to the method the software authenticates the user of a social networking service which maintains one or more lists of contacts associated with the user that can be used by the user to selectively share content. The software ascertains a proposed group of contacts from at least one of the lists. The user and members of the proposed group are related by a plurality of communications and the communications are associated with one or more attributes associated with the communications. The data for the one or more attributes is collected through a platform through applications associated with a platform or through a combination of a platform and applications associated with the platform. The software presents the proposed group of contacts to the user with a recommendation that the user create a new list of contacts associated with the user from the proposed group of contacts. The software creates the new list of contacts from the proposed group if the user indicates acceptance of the recommendation.

Other aspects and advantages of the implementations will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the principles of the implementations.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the implementations described below. However it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that some implementations may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances process operations and implementation details have not been described in detail if already well known.

In some implementations each of the websites and might be composed of a number of servers connected by a network e.g. a local area network LAN or a WAN to each other in a cluster or other distributed system which might execute cloud platform software. The servers in website and might also be connected to persistent storages and respectively which might include a storage area network SAN . In some implementations persistent storages and might include flash memory and or a redundant array of independent disks RAID .

In some implementations persistent storage might be used to store control lists and content associated with users of the social networking service hosted on website . Also in some implementations persistent storage might be used to store logic e.g. software and data for the processes described below including data related to the location e.g. geographic or enumerated of personal computing device or mobile computing device and or communications whose source or destination is personal computing device or mobile computing device . Some of that data might have been retrieved e.g. through an application programming interface or API from a the email chat service hosted on website where the data might have been stored in persistent storage and or b the website hosting servers for an app e.g. location based or communication based where the data might have been stored in persistent storage .

As depicted in software e.g. running on servers in website authenticates a user of a social networking service that maintains one or more control lists of contacts associated with the user which allows the user to selectively share content with the contacts on the control list e.g. by allowing access to content or by broadcasting content in operation . Such a control list is analogous to an access control list ACL used by a file system. Such a control list is also analogous to a distribution list d list used by an email service. In some implementations the content might include a link e.g. a Uniform Resource Locator or URL or other text an image a document audio video etc.

In operation the software ascertains a proposed group of contacts from the control lists in some implementations. The proposed group might be a subset of the contacts on one or more of the control lists. Or the proposed group might be a superset of the contacts on one or more of the control lists. In some implementations the members of the group might be related by communications with the user or between each other. Further each of those communications might be associated with one or more attributes such as the locations e.g. geographic or enumerated related to a communication the source and destination of a communication the time of a communication the date of a communication the medium of a communication the type of a communication etc.

In some implementations the data for the attributes might have been retrieved using APIs from websites hosting an email chat service or a website hosting servers for an app as described above. Also in some implementations the data for the attributes might have been collected using a platform e.g. an operating system for a mobile computing device an app and or an app that is serves as a platform for another app. And in some implementations the attributes and or statistics based on the attributes e.g. frequencies as described below might be represented as a tuple or vector in order to facilitate processing during the ascertaining operation.

In operation in the software presents e.g. through a GUI view the proposed group of contacts to the user with a recommendation that the user create a new control list of contacts associated with the user from the proposed group of contacts e.g. using an identifier for the proposed group inferred from the content of the communications . And in operation the software creates a new control list for the proposed group e.g. using the inferred identifier if the user indicates acceptance of recommendation e.g. through a GUI view . Then in operation the software shares content posted by the user with the contacts on the new control list according to a command from the user e.g. received through a GUI view .

As indicated above the communications might be associated with attributes such as the locations e.g. geographic or enumerated related to a communication the source and destination of a communication the time of a communication the date of a communication the medium of a communication and the type of a communication. In some implementations the software might determine the geographic locations related to a communication using the computing device which transmits the communication and the computing device which ultimately receives the communication. In turn the geographic location for a computing device might be determined using a a global positioning system GPS b a WiFi positioning system which includes an indoor positioning system c multilateration e.g. using radio towers d data such as check ins retrieved from location based social media and or e a hybrid system that uses a combination of a b c or d .

In some implementations the software might determine the enumerated location for a communication from the user or from the hardware firmware software for a computing device. For example a user might indicate that he she is using the computing device at home or the computing device at work . Or the computing device itself might indicate that it is at home or at work e.g. on the basis of an entry in a registry database.

Similarly in some implementations the software might determine the time of a communication and or the date of a communication from the computing device that transmits the communication or a computing device that receives the communication. In some implementations data as to time and date might included in the control data for a communication e.g. in the communication s header. It will be appreciated that the control or header data might also be used to determine the medium of a communication e.g. if the control data corresponds to a communication protocol e.g. an email protocol a Short Message Service SMS protocol for text messages an instant messaging protocol etc. . In some implementations the medium of a communication might not involve a communication protocol e.g. communications made through the social networking service including sharing and direct messaging.

Also the control or header data for a communication might include the source and destination for the communication in accordance with a communication protocol e.g. an email protocol a Short Message Service SMS protocol for text messages an instant messaging protocol etc. . If the communication is a phone call the source might be determined from caller identification caller ID data. Or the source and the destination might be determined by hardware firmware software on the computing devices transmitting and receiving the phone call.

In some implementations the software might determine the type of a communication from an analysis e.g. lexical semantic lexical semantic hybrid etc. of the body or content of the communication. For example if the content of the communication pertains to a software project the software might be able to classify the communication as a software project communication or more generally as a work communication.

As shown in GUI dialog includes a textbox that states We ve noticed that you often communicate with the same people. We can help you organize those people into groups so that you share your posts with the people most interested in them. GUI dialog also includes three GUI buttons. If the user clicks GUI button labeled OK the client program will display another GUI dialog that assists the user with creating a new control list as described further below. If the user clicks GUI button labeled CANCEL the client program will close the GUI dialog and will not display it for a relatively long period of time e.g. approximately two weeks or so. If the user clicks GUI button labeled LATER the client program will close the GUI dialog and will not display it for a relatively short period of time e.g. approximately two days or so.

As shown in GUI dialog that shows the profile images for a proposed group of contacts below a text box stating You tend to communicate with these people during the day. Beneath each of the profile images is a GUI button e.g. GUI button labeled REMOVE that the user can use to eliminate the contact associated with the GUI button as a potential candidate for the new control list. Beneath the GUI buttons is another text box that states Would you like to create a group to share posts with them If you want to add someone else to the group you can drag and drop them into the group once it is created. 

GUI dialog also includes two other GUI buttons. If the user clicks GUI button labeled OK the client program will display another GUI dialog that assists the user with naming the new control list as described further below. If the user clicks GUI button labeled CANCEL the client program will close the GUI dialog and the software e.g. software running on the servers at the website hosting the social networking service will take no further action with respect to the proposed group e.g. until the user indicates a subsequent willingness to entertain the recommendation e.g. through another GUI dialog or until the proposed group works its way back to the top of a queue e.g. FIFO weighted priority etc. . In some implementations the queue might be weighted and the weight might be reduced according to the number of refusals which the user has made with respect to the proposed group.

As shown in GUI dialog includes a text box that states as follows Pursuant to your privacy preferences with us we have performed an anonymous analysis of your communications with these people using computers. Click to immediately change your privacy preferences. It looks like many of your communications with these people involve a software project. In the box below we have entered a suggested name for this group. Feel free to change it. In some implementations the underlined language is hyperlink e.g. a URL that will take the user to a web page that allows the user to change his her privacy preferences if the user clicks on the hyperlink.

As indicated by the quoted language the software e.g. software running on the servers at the website hosting the social networking service might infer an identifier for the new control list from an analysis e.g. a keyword metadata analysis performed offline or near online of the content of the communications that were used to identify the contacts for the group including earlier communications e.g. sharing and direct messaging through the social networking service. Or the software might infer an identifier for the proposed group from the control or header data of the communications e.g. the subject or from the control lists associated with the user. For example if all the contacts in a group share the same last name on a control list associated with the user e.g. Johnson the software might infer an identifier for the new control list such as Johnson family . GUI dialog also includes an edit box which includes the recommended identifier e.g. software team . The user can accept the recommended identifier by clicking on a GUI button labeled OK which is located beneath the edit box . In some implementations if the user clicks GUI button or enters his her own identifier for the new control list in the edit box the software e.g. the software running on the server will create a new control list that the user can use for the purposes of sharing content through the social networking service.

Also beneath the edit box is a GUI button labeled CANCEL . If the user clicks that GUI button the client program will close the GUI dialog and the software e.g. software running on the servers at the website hosting the social networking service will take no further action with respect to the proposed group e.g. until the user indicates a subsequent willingness to entertain the recommendation e.g. through another GUI dialog or until the proposed group works its way back to the top of a queue e.g. FIFO weighted priority etc. . In some implementations the queue might be weighted and the weight might be reduced according to the number of refusals which the user has made with respect to the proposed group.

In some implementations this GUI dialog might be displayed as a user finishes entering a post to be shared through the social networking service or shortly e.g. within approximately thirty seconds after the user finishes entering the post. As shown in GUI dialog includes a text box that states as follows This looks like it might be a good post for the software team . Would you like to share it with them GUI dialog also included two GUI buttons. If the user clicks GUI button labeled OK the post will be shared with group identified as software team . If the user clicks GUI button labeled CANCEL the client program will close the GUI dialog without causing the post to be shared with that group. In some implementations the software e.g. software running on the servers at the website hosting the social networking service might infer a recommended group for a post by matching e.g. online or near online matching of keywords including metadata the content of the post with the content of earlier posts and communications by the group which might be pre processed offline.

As shown in GUI dialog includes a text box that states as follows You seem to like our recommendations for groups to share your postings with. We think our recommendations might be better if our computers analyze your call history and your text history. No human ears will listen to your calls. And no human eyes will see your texts. Would you like us to include your call and text histories when making recommendations for groups to you You can stop at any time by changing your privacy preferences. Beneath text box are two check boxes which allow the user to make his her call history text history or both call history and text history available for analysis e.g. by the software running on the servers at the website hosting the social networking service.

GUI dialog also includes three GUI buttons. If the user clicks GUI button labeled OK the client program will communicate the user s choice to the software running on the servers at the website hosting the social networking service so that the call history and text history can be retrieved e.g. through an API exposed by a telephone telecommunications service and or monitored e.g. by the user s mobile device . If the user clicks GUI button labeled CANCEL the client program will close the GUI dialog and it will not be displayed for a relatively long period of time e.g. approximately two months or so. If the user clicks GUI button labeled LATER the client program will close the GUI dialog and it will not be displayed for a relatively short period of time e.g. approximately two days or so.

In other implementations the histogram used by the software might be based on other attributes or statistics based on those attributes such as geographic locations related to a communication geographic distances related to a communication source and destination of a communication date of a communication type of communication etc.

So for example the software might infer a proposed group e.g. of co employees from the contacts of the user who the user communicates with through calls during the morning and afternoon hours. Or as another example the software might infer a proposed group e.g. of family members from the contacts of the user who user communicates with by texting during morning and afternoon hours.

Returning to personal computing device and the servers at websites and might include 1 hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors volatile storage e.g. RAM and persistent storage e.g. flash memory or a hard disk or solid state drive and 2 an operating system that runs directly or indirectly e.g. through virtualization software on the hardware. Alternatively the operating system for the servers at websites and might be replaced by a hypervisor or other virtualization software. In some implementations mobile computing device might be a smartphone tablet computer or other mobile device that includes 1 hardware consisting of one or more low power microprocessors volatile storage e.g. RAM and persistent storage e.g. flash memory such as microSD and 2 an operating system that runs on the hardware.

In some implementations personal computing device and or mobile computing device might include a web browser as an application program or part of an operating system. It will be appreciated that users of personal computing device and or mobile computing device might use browsers to communicate with software running on the servers at websites and . Alternatively users of personal computing device and or mobile computing device might use other application programs to communicate with software running on the servers at websites and .

In some implementations the webserver and database software for the servers in websites and might be implemented using a public private or hybrid cloud platform e.g. a hybrid cloud platform with a public cloud and a private cloud. In other implementations software for the servers in websites and might be implemented without resort to third party cloud platforms e.g. using webserver software structured or unstructured database management software load balancing and virtualization software distributed memory caching software other distributed computing software etc.

With the above implementations in mind it should be understood that they might employ various computer implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems. These operations are those requiring physical manipulation of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. Further the manipulations performed are often referred to in terms such as producing identifying determining or comparing.

Any of the operations described herein that form part of the implementations are useful machine operations. The implementations also relate to a device or an apparatus for performing these operations. The apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes such as the carrier network discussed above or it may be a general purpose computer selectively activated or configured by a computer program stored in the computer. In particular various general purpose machines may be used with computer programs written in accordance with the teachings herein or it may be more convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required operations.

The implementations can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium include hard drives network attached storage NAS read only memory random access memory CD ROMs CD Rs CD RWs DVDs Flash magnetic tapes and other optical and non optical data storage devices. The computer readable medium can also be distributed over a network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.

Although implementations of the implementations have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications can be practiced within the scope of the following claims. The operations described above can be ordered modularized and or distributed in any suitable way. Accordingly the present implementations are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the implementations are not to be limited to the details given herein but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the following claims. In the following claims elements and or steps do not imply any particular order of operation unless explicitly stated in the claims or implicitly required by the disclosure.
