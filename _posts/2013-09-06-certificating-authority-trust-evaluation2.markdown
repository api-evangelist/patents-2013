title: Certificating authority trust evaluation
abstract: In many information security scenarios, a certificate issued by a certificating authority may be presented to a client in order to assert a trust level of a certificated item, such as a message or a web page. However, due to a decentralized structure and incomplete coordination among certificating authorities, the presence and exploitation of security vulnerabilities to issue untrustworthy certificates may be difficult to determine, particularly for an individual client. Presented herein are techniques for providing a certificating authority trust service that collects and evaluates certificates submitted to clients by certificating authorities, and advises the clients of a certificating authority trust level for respective certificating authorities (e.g., determined as a consensus of the evaluated certificates issued by the certificating authority). The clients may use a certificating authority trust set distributed by the certificating authority trust service to determine whether to trust a certificate issued from a particular certificating authority.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve authentication using a certificate issued by a certificating authority. For example a user may connect to a website to perform a sensitive interaction such as a financial transaction using credentials that might be misused if intercepted by a third party. Accordingly the website may submit a certificate verifying its identity and signed by a certificating authority. The device of the user may examine the cryptographic signatures of the certificate to verify its authenticity that the identity of the issuer and the authenticity of the certificate before proceeding with the transaction and the provision of credentials.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The certificating authority system is subject to exploitation due to a variety of technical and non technical aspects. As a first example vulnerabilities may be discovered and exploited in the mathematical models on which security techniques are based e.g. flaws in the MD5 hashing algorithm may permit the forgery of certificates or the alteration of signed content. As a second example under the current certification model a set of certificating authorities is identified and globally trusted such that any certificating authority may issue certificates for any domain as a result the exploitation coercion or malicious actions of any one certificating authority may result in the issuance of inauthentic certificates for any domain. As a third example it may be difficult to detect exploits of certificating authorities particular certificates and the security models involved therein because relevant information may be withheld e.g. certificating authorities often do not provide public records of issued certificates and or currently utilized security techniques and or may be unable to assess outside of a collective process that currently does not exist e.g. some types of exploits may be apparent from a collection of certificates submitted to a variety of users but may be undetectable from individual certificates .

In view of these limitations the present disclosure involves a collective model for gathering evaluating and disseminating trust information about certificating authorities and certificates. In accordance with this model a trust advising service may collect a set of certificates received by various users e.g. the web browsers of individual users and or a trusted set of crawlers that crawl the internet and download certificates provided by various domains under various circumstances. The trust advisor may evaluate the collection of certificates e.g. using an automated evaluation process involving a set of heuristics such as the concurrence issuance of certificates for a particular domain from different certificating authorities that may reveal the trustworthiness of the certificating authority and or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in certificating security techniques. Based on these determinations the trust advisor may generate a certificating authority trust set indicating the current trust level of various certificating authorities and may disseminate the certificating authority trust set to a set of devices such as a set of web browsers. The devices may then evaluate any subsequently received certificate issued by a certificating authority on behalf of a particular domain in view of the trust level of the certificating authority indicated by the certificating authority trust set. In this manner the techniques presented herein may enable the devices to evaluate the trust of certificates using collective information in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In order to provide such verification a first certificating authority may be provided that has established a level of trust with the first client . The first certificating authority may generate a first certificate identifying one or more aspects of the identity of the first node and or the certificated item e.g. a hashcode of the content of a message and cryptographically signed with a credential of the first certificating authority e.g. using a cryptographic private key of an asymmetric encryption technique . The first certificating authority may then provide the first certificate for the certificated item to the first node which may in turn provide the first certificate with the first certificated item to the first client . Upon receiving the certificate with the certificated item the first client may authenticate the first certificate with a credential of the first certificating authority e.g. verifying the signature of the first certificate with a cryptographic public key of the first certificating authority and may compare the first certificate with the certificated item e.g. comparing a hashcode of the content of the certificated item with the hashcode recorded in the first certificate . Verification of the first certificate with the credential of the first certificating authority enables a trust level of the first client in the authenticity of the first certificate e.g. that the first certificate was actually generated by the first certificating authority and not a third party and that the first certificate has not been altered subsequent to generation and an accurate comparison of the first certificate with the first certificated item enables a trust level of the first client in the authenticity of the first certificated item e.g. that the first certificated item has not been altered since it was presented to the first certificating authority for certification . In this manner trust levels in certificated items may be established on behalf of clients by certificating authorities even if such certificated items and certificates are handled by untrusted intermediaries.

In view of these techniques a body of certificating authorities may be created according to a set of security practices. Occasionally exploits in the body of certificating authorities may prompt changes to the structure and underlying security techniques of such certificating authorities . For example vulnerabilities may be occasionally discovered in some of the mathematical techniques used in certificate generation that enable an attacker to alter the contents of the certificates issued by certificating authorities . For instance the hashing algorithm identified as MD5 was regarded as applicable to a particular set of content with a cryptographic private key resulting in a hashcode for the content of a certificated item that is verifiable with the corresponding cryptographic public key that enables the detection of alterations to the signed content and that cannot be generated without possessing the cryptographic private key corresponding to the cryptographic public key. However the mathematical techniques comprising the MD5 hashing algorithm is presumed to be resistant to brute force computational cracking by contemporary computing machinery and techniques but may be vulnerable to such brute force computational cracking by computing technologies that may be available in the future. Such brute force computational cracking allow the generation of certificates without possession of the cryptographic private key and or the adjustment of a validly generated hashcode in a manner that verifies against altered content. While such exploits may be computationally very difficult the feasibility of generating hashcodes for forged or altered certificates has prompted a revocation of public trust in the MD5 hashing algorithm and has prompted certificating authorities to shift security practices in the generation of certificates from using the MD5 hashing algorithm to other hashing algorithms such as SHA 2 that are not currently known to present mathematical flaws or vulnerabilities. As another example hashing techniques such as MD5 may be exploited by computing two different sets of content that result in the same MD5 hashcode. A signature of the first content set by the certificating authority may also authenticate the second content set having the same hashcode and thus a certificate based on such an MD5 signature may incorrectly certificate two different certificated items .

However difficulties in this technique may arise from a decentralized body of certificating authorities . For example certificating authorities may operate independently and may not uniformly agree about the selection and implementation of security practices to be used in generating certificates . Accordingly a first certificating authority may use a security practice such as a particular hashing algorithm that a second certificating authority considers unsecure. Additionally incomplete disclosure by a particular certificating authority of the security practices utilized in generating certificates e.g. policies for rotating certificating credentials may cause difficulty in assessing the trust level to be placed in the certificates generated by the certificating authority . Accordingly a lack of collective evaluation of trust in certificating authorities may inhibit the evaluation of trust levels . For example a particular client presented with a certificate may have limited access to information as to the trust level to be ascribed to the certificating authority and or the certificate and may therefore be unable to evaluate the trust level of the certificate beyond the content thereof. Additionally diagnostic information pertaining to the trust level of certificating authorities may be apparent in patterns of activity in the issuance of a variety certificates by the certificating authority to a variety of clients but the evaluation of such information may be inhibited by the unavailability of mechanisms for collecting and evaluating the certificates issued by the certificating authority and received by a variety of clients .

Accordingly the trust level to be placed in certificating authorities may be subject to exploitation that may be difficult to detect. As a first such example in some certificating authority scenarios any certificating authority may issue a public certificate for any network domain. The trust level in the integrity of the certificating authority system may thus be subject to exploitation e.g. certificates ostensibly representing a first entity such as a first company or a first national government may be issued by a certificating authority that is collaborating with an adverse second entity such as a competing company or a hostile second national government . As a second such example because certificating authorities may not provide public records of the certificates issued on behalf of various domains it may be difficult for a domain to detect the issuance of unauthorized certificates on its behalf. As a third such example it may be difficult to review the security practices utilized by a particular certificating authority e.g. some certificating authorities may be slow or reluctant to transition away from using security practice that is found to be unsecure. As a fourth such example some types of exploits may be detectable only by a collective evaluation of many certificates e.g. the issuance of certificates on behalf of a particular domain concurrently by two or more different certificating authorities may raise a security concern but the detection of this condition may be difficult to discern from the examination of any particular certificate in isolation. Moreover due to the absence of a collective process to gather examine reach a consensus on and disseminate information about the trust placed in respective certificating authorities makes it difficult for any particular client to determine whether or not to determine the trust level of a certificate issued by a particular certificating authority to a particular node such as a particular domain of the network.

Such problems are further illustrated in the exemplary scenario of . As a first such example the first client may receive from a second network node a second certificate that is associated with a second certificated item and that indicates issuance by the first certificating authority . However the second certificate may not have been issued by the first certificating authority but may instead have been forged e.g. by the second network node or a third party through the exploitation of a security vulnerability e.g. the use of a compromised credential of the first certificating authority . Accordingly it may be desirable for the client to identify an untrustworthiness of the second certificate but the first client may not be able to determine such untrustworthiness simply by examining the second certificate . As a second example a second certificating authority that exhibits untrustworthiness e.g. a history of issuing improper certificates may issue a third certificate for a third certificated item and the third certificate may be submitted to the first client . However even if the first client is able to determine the untrustworthiness of the third certificate issued by the second certificating authority such determination of untrustworthiness may not be communicated to a second client which upon receiving the third certificate may incorrectly determine an acceptable trust level in the third certificate and the second certificating authority . Due to these aspects illustrated in the exemplary scenario of and other aspects of a system of certificating authorities determinations of trust levels of certificating authorities may be difficult.

Presented herein are techniques that may enable a reduction or avoidance of exploitable vulnerabilities that may arise within a system of certificating authorities . In accordance with these techniques a certificating authority trust service may be devised that collects certificates that have been presented to clients for the authentication of various certificated items . For example the devices utilized by a set of users may automatically submit some received certificates to a certificating authority trust service. Alternatively or additionally a certificating authority trust service may utilize a set of trusted clients e.g. a trusted set of crawlers that automatically explore a set of domains and collect certificates submitted by the domains and apparently issued by a certificating authority . The certificates collected from various nodes may be evaluated to evaluate a trust level of the certificating authorities using a variety of heuristics. The certificating authority trust service may generate a certificating authority trust set indicating a trust level for respective certificating authorities and may distribute the certificating authority trust set to a set of clients . Each client may then evaluate subsequently received certificates based on the trust level of the certificating authority issuing the certificate as indicated by the certificating authority trust set as well as various other heuristics for assessing the trust of a certificate . These and other techniques may be utilized to detect disseminate and utilize a collective certificate trust evaluation process in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage devices involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage devices various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable storage device e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data .

Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary first method of the exemplary system of the exemplary second method of and the exemplary computer readable storage device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized with many types of clients such as devices operated by one or more users one or more applications executing on such devices and or online services provided on behalf of one or more users or other applications.

As a second variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to determine a trust level in various types of certificated items presented to and or accessed by a client such as messages applications websites and or identifying credentials of one or more nodes of a network.

As a third variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to evaluate the trust levels of various types of certificates issued by various types of certificating authorities such as the X.509 certification based trust infrastructure.

As a fourth variation of this first aspect many types of certificating authority trust services may be provided to facilitate the evaluation by clients of trust levels of various certificates and certificating authorities . Such certificating authority trust services may comprise a public service provided to any client or a semi private or private service provided to a specific set of clients . Alternatively or additionally a certificating authority trust service may identify the certificating authority trust levels of any certificating authority or of only a subset of certificating authorities such as those issuing particular types of certificates those issuing certificates only for a particular set of certificated items or those interoperating on behalf of a particular set of nodes and or clients .

As a fifth variation of this first aspect one or more clients may utilize the certificating authority trust set in various ways. As a first such example a client may only permit access to certificated items that are associated with a certificate issued by a certificating authority having a high certificating authority trust level specified in the certificating authority trust set and may restrict access to other certificated items . As a second such example a client may permit access to certificated items certified by certificates issued by certificating authorities that are not associated with a high certificating authority trust level according to the certificating authority trust set but may do so only after warning a user of the certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority and or may provide access within tightened security credentials e.g. executing a first application certified by a first certificate issued by a first certificating authority having a high certificating authority trust level natively and with a high level of privileges and executing a second application certified by a second certificate executed by a second certificating authority having a low certificating authority trust level with a restricted set of privileges such as within an isolation construct such as a virtual machine having limited access to the device of the user . These and other scenarios may be compatible with the application of the techniques presented herein.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein relates to the generation use and content of the certificating authority trust set generated by the certificating authority trust service and distributed to the clients .

As a first variation of this second aspect the certificating authority trust set may identify the certificating authority trust levels assigned to the certificating authorities in various ways. For example the certificating authority trust set may identify that respective certificating authorities are trustworthy or untrustworthy or may indicate a degree of trustworthiness e.g. a percentage or letter score for the certificating authority . As another example the certificating authority trust set may identify a particular certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority for particular types of certificates and or certificated items .

As a second variation of this second aspect a certificating authority trust service may determine the certificate trust levels of various certificates and or the certificating authority trust levels of various certificating authorities in various ways. Many types of heuristics and rules may be utilized in such determinations based on an evaluation of factors such as the content of the certificate the certificated item certified by the certificate and the node presenting the certificate .

As a third variation of this second aspect upon receiving a certificate issued by a selected certificating authority that does not yet have a certificating authority trust level in the certificating authority trust set such as a new newly participating or first observed certificating authority a device such as a certificating authority trust service or a client may store in the certificating authority trust set an untrusted certificating authority trust level for the selected certificating authority e.g. initially establishing a low trust level for the certificating authority until the certificating authority has consistently demonstrated verifiable trustworthiness .

As a fourth variation of this second aspect the certificating authority trust set may further identify the certificate trust levels of one or more certificates . For example the certificating authority trust set may specify that one or more certificates issued by a particular certificating authority are trustworthy or are untrustworthy e.g. a list of certificates that have been revoked by the certificating authority following the discovery of a security vulnerability affecting the trust level of those certificates . A client may upon receiving a certificate determine the certificate trust level of the certificate specified by the certificating authority trust set and evaluate the certificated item according to the certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority that issued the certificate for the certificated item and the certificate trust level of the certificate specified by the certificating authority trust set.

As a fifth variation of this second aspect one or more clients may also be configured to send to the certificating authority trust service only particular types of certificates . As a first such example where the certificating authority trust set specifies certificate trust levels for one or more certificates a client may be configured to submit to the certificating authority trust service only certificates that do not have a certificate trust level in the certificate authority trust set e.g. only certificates that the certificating authority trust service has not yet evaluated . As a second such example one or more clients may configured to send to the certificating authority trust service only certificates that are associated with a publicly accessible certificated item e.g. only for publicly accessible domains . These and other variations in the generation and distribution of the certificating authority trust set may be utilized in embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein relates to the use of a trusted client set by a certificating authority trust service . In scenarios where the certificating authority trust service receives and evaluates certificates from certificating authorities from a variety of clients e.g. a publicly accessible certificating authority trust service the trust level of the clients may vary e.g. a particular client may seek to degrade a trust level of a certificated item a certificate a certificating authority or a node by submitting a tampered certificate to the certificating authority trust service . While a consensus approach may alleviate some instances of such degradation of trust e.g. determining the certificating authority trust level of a certificating authority according to a consensus evaluation of a large set of certificates submitted by a large set of clients a distributed denial of service attack e.g. submitting a large number of tampered certificates from a large number of cooperating clients may skew the consensus determination.

In view of these observations it may be desirable for a certificating authority trust service to receive certificates from at least one trusted client in addition to at least one untrusted client of a client set and to determines the certificate trust levels of the certificates by identifying the client sending the certificate as an untrusted client or a trusted client. Upon identifying the client as an untrusted client a certificate evaluator may determine the certificate trust level of the certificate with a first certificate trust level confidence and upon identifying the client as a trusted client the certificate evaluator may determine the certificate trust level of the certificate with a second certificate trust level confidence that is higher than the first certificate trust level confidence. Alternatively or additionally the certificating authority trust service may instruct the trusted clients to explore particular nodes of a network in response to requests submitted by untrusted clients e.g. directing a trusted crawler to crawl one or more websites associated with a particular domain reported according to a selection criteria set such as a new node selection criterion that identifies the selected node as a new node of the network and a suspicious node activity selection criterion that associated the node with at least one potentially suspicious node activity . Upon receiving a certificated item from a selected node of a network a client may send to the certificating authority trust service a request to explore the selected node of the network and a trusted client controller of the certificating authority service may instruct a trusted client to explore a network comprising at least one node and upon receiving a certificate issued by a certificating authority while exploring a selected node of the network send the certificate and an identifier of the certificating authority to the certificate evaluator. In some scenarios respective trusted clients of the trusted client set may be associated with a trusted client region e.g. a particular geographic region and respective nodes of the network are associated with a node region. The trusted client controller may instruct respective trusted clients to explore the network by for respective selected nodes to be explored identifying the node region of the selected node identifying a selected trusted client that is associated with a trusted client region correlated with the node region of the selected node and instructing the selected trusted client to explore the selected node of the network.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein relates to the interoperation of a certificating authority trust service with certificating authorities . For example the certificating authority trust service may assist the certificating authorities with the identification of detected vulnerabilities and or the implementation of security practices that may improve the certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority .

As a first variation of this fourth aspect a certificating authority trust service may notify a certificating authority of events relating to its certificating authority trust level such as receiving from a client a selected certificate issued by a certificating authority that has not previously been evaluated e.g. a previously unseen certificate apparently issued by the certificating authority and or upon determining an untrusted certificate trust level for a selected certificate e.g. upon detecting a suspicious certificate that appears to have been tampered and or forged .

As a second variation of this fourth aspect upon receiving from a certificating authority a trust level disclosure request e.g. a request by the certificating authority to disclose its certificating authority trust level a certificating authority trust service may disclose the certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority in the certificating authority trust set to the certificating authority .

As a third variation of this fourth aspect the certificating authority trust service may identify one or more security practices that if implemented by a particular certificating authority alleviates a low or untrusted certificate trust level of at least one certificate issued by the certificating authority e.g. identifying an unsecure hashing algorithm utilized by the certificating authority to sign some certificates and may notify the certificating authority of the security practice that may be implemented to raise the certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority . Additionally the certificating authority trust service may monitor the certificating authority to detect the implementation of the identified security practice e.g. the alleviation of a security vulnerability and may raise the certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority upon detecting the implementation of the security practice and or reduce the certificating authority trust level of the certificating authority upon detecting a failure of the certificating authority to implement the security practice within an implementation period.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.
