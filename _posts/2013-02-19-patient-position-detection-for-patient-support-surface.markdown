This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 696 449 which was filed Sep. 4 2012 and which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The present disclosure relates to patient support apparatuses such as hospital beds. More particularly the present disclosure relates to patient support apparatuses having surfaces or mattresses with air bladders that are inflated or deflated to achieve turn assist or therapeutic functions.

Hospital beds having patient support surfaces with a turn assist feature are known. Turn assist involves turning a patient toward the left side or the right side for an extended period of time so that a caregiver can more easily perform a task such as changing a wound dressing or changing bed linens. Hospital beds that have therapy features are also known. For example in contrast to turn assist rotation therapy involves alternately and repeatedly turning a patient from side to side by inflating and or deflating bladders on a right side and a left side of a mattress. Rotation therapy is sometimes referred to as continuous lateral rotation therapy CLRT . Other therapies associated with mattresses include low air loss therapy percussion and or vibration therapy alternating pressure therapy and wave mode therapy such as Hill Rom s OPTIREST feature just to name a few.

It is desirable for a patient to be properly positioned on a mattress when the turn assist function is operated or when a therapy function is operated. If the patient is not properly positioned on the mattress the overall efficacy of the function or therapy may be degraded or compromised. The known prior art mattress systems rely on a caregiver s ability to visually determine whether or not a patient is properly positioned on a mattress prior to initiating a turn assist function or a therapeutic function of the mattress. It is not uncommon for patients to inadvertently shift toward a foot end of a hospital bed of the type having a bed frame with movable mattress support sections. This is because when a head section of the bed frame is raised to place a patient in a sitting up position for example the patient has a tendency to slide down the head section toward the foot end of the bed such that when the head section is lowered back down again the patient remains shifted toward the foot end of the bed. Then when one or more caregivers pull a patient back up in bed they may pull the patient too far toward the head end of the bed. Accordingly there is room for improvement in connection with providing information to caregivers as to whether a patient is or is not properly positioned on a mattress.

An apparatus system or method may comprise one or more of the features recited in the appended claims and or the following features which alone or in any combination may comprise patentable subject matter 

A patient support apparatus may include a patient support surface to support a patient. The patient support surface may have at least one air bladder that either inflated or deflated or both to achieve at least one of a turn assist function and a therapy function of the patient support surface. The patient support apparatus may also have a graphical user interface GUI that may be configured to receive user inputs from a caregiver to initiate the turn assist function and the therapy function. The patient support apparatus may further have control circuitry that may be coupled to the GUI. The GUI may be controlled by the control circuitry to display information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned on the patient support surface for the turn assist function and the therapy function.

According to this disclosure the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned may include for example information indicating that the patient is shifted too far toward at least one of the head end and the foot end of the patient support surface. The information indicating that the patient is shifted too far toward at least one of the head end and the foot end of the patient support surface may include one or more of the following i a text box with a message conveying the information ii a pictorial representation of a patient lying on the patient support surface too close to the at least one of the head end and foot end and iii a hip position icon that is color coded such as being color coded yellow or red depending upon the amount that the patient s position deviates from the proper position. In some embodiments the hip position icon may be positioned over a pictorial representation of the patient lying on the patient support surface.

In some embodiments the turn assist function or the therapy function initiated by the caregiver may proceed automatically despite the improper position of the patient on the patient support surface. It is contemplated that one or more caregivers may take corrective action to move the patient to the proper position while the function operates in such embodiments. In other embodiments the turn assist function or the therapy function initiated by the caregiver may be suspended including not even being started until after the caregiver selects a first icon on the GUI to ignore the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned. If the caregiver selects the first icon the function will proceed to operate. The GUI may also display a second icon that may be selected by the caregiver to abort the turn assist function or the therapy function altogether.

According to some embodiments before the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned on the patient support surface is displayed on the GUI the GUI may display a patient information icon that must be selected by the caregiver. The patient information icon may flash on the GUI for example in response to the caregiver attempting to initiate the turn assist function or the therapy function. After the caregiver selects the patient information icon the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned on the patient support surface such as that mentioned above may appear on the GUI.

According to this disclosure the patient support apparatus may further include a bed frame that supports the patient support surface. The bed frame may include a foot board. In some embodiments the GUI and control circuitry may be included in a housing that may be supported on the foot board such as being hung on the footboard or attached to a bracket on the footboard. In other embodiments the bed frame may include a siderail and the GUI may be mounted to the siderail. The control circuitry may be carried by the siderail or elsewhere on the bed frame in such embodiments.

The bed frame that supports the patient support surface may also carry a plurality of sensors. In some embodiments such sensors may be used to determine a weight of the patient supported on the patient support surface or may be used to determine a position of the patient on the patient support surface. Each sensor of the plurality of sensors may include a load cell a force sensitive resistor FSR element a piezoelectric material or element a capacitive sensor or an optical sensor just to name a few. If load cells are used they may include strain gages or capacitors for example. Alternatively or additionally the patient support surface may have a plurality of patient support bladders and a plurality of sensors such as pressure sensors or other types of sensors that may be used to determine a position of the patient on the patient support surface based on signals from the sensors that may be indicative as to which of the plurality of bladders the patient is atop.

The information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned on the patient support surface may be displayed on the GUI prior to the caregiver using the user inputs to initiate the turn assist function or the therapy function. The GUI may also be controlled by the control circuitry to display information indicating that the patient is properly positioned on the patient support surface. Thus the patient position information may be among the default information that is displayed on the GUI on a home screen. In other embodiments the information indicating whether the patient is properly positioned or improperly positioned is not normally displayed on the GUI but appears after certain user inputs are selected by a caregiver. In some embodiments the information indicating whether the patient is properly positioned or improperly positioned may include information regarding the patient s position in the lateral direction of the patient support surface.

Alternatively or additionally a patient support apparatus may include a patient support structure to support a patient. The patient support structure may be considered to have a head end and a foot end. The patient support structure may have a head section that supports a torso of a patient and that may be movable between a raised position supporting the patient in a sitting up position and a lowered position supporting the patient in a lying down position. The patient support apparatus may also have a set of user inputs that may be configured to receive input from a caregiver to initiate the movement of the head section between the raised and lowered positions. The set of user inputs may include a graphical user interface GUI . Control circuitry of the patient support apparatus may be coupled to the GUI. The GUI may be controlled by the control circuitry to display information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned on the patient support structure for the movement of the head section toward the raised position.

In some embodiments the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned includes may include one or more of the following i a text box with a message conveying the information ii a pictorial representation of a patient lying on the patient support surface too close to the at least one of the head end and foot end and iii a hip position icon that is color coded. The movement of the head section toward the raised position may be suspended until after the caregiver selects a first icon on the GUI to ignore the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned. Alternatively the movement of the head section toward the raised position may be prevented altogether until after the patient is moved to a proper position on the patient support structure.

According to this disclosure the patient support structure may include a bed frame that in turn may include a siderail. The GUI may be mounted to the siderail. In some embodiments the bed frame may have a plurality of sensors that may be used to determine a weight of the patient and that may be used to determine a position of the patient on the patient support surface. The information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned may be displayed on the GUI prior to the caregiver using the user inputs to initiate the raising of the head section. The GUI also may be controlled by the control circuitry to display information indicating that the patient is properly positioned on the patient support surface. The set of user inputs may further include a plurality of buttons spaced from the GUI. At least one button of the plurality of buttons may be used to initiate movement of the head section toward the raised position.

Additional features which alone or in combination with any other feature s such as those listed above and those listed in the claims may comprise patentable subject matter and will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of various embodiments exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the embodiments as presently perceived.

A patient support apparatus such as illustrative hospital bed includes a patient support structure such as a frame that supports a surface or mattress as shown in . Mattress is sometimes referred to herein as patient support surface or just surface . Thus according to this disclosure a bed frame a mattress or both are examples of things considered to be within the scope of the term patient support structure. However this disclosure is applicable to other types of patient support apparatuses and other patient support structures including other types of beds surgical tables examination tables stretchers and the like. As will be described below in further detail a graphical user interface GUI of bed is operable to view data or information regarding a position of a patient on bed and to alert a caregiver to reposition the patient prior to a turn assist function being performed and or prior to a therapy function being performed.

Referring again to frame of bed includes a base an upper frame assembly and a lift system coupling upper frame assembly to base . Lift system is operable to raise lower and tilt upper frame assembly relative to base . Bed has a head end and a foot end . Hospital bed further includes a footboard at the foot end and a headboard at the head end . Illustrative bed includes a pair of push handles coupled to an upstanding portion of base at the head end of bed . Headboard is coupled to upstanding portion of base as well. Footboard is coupled to upper frame assembly . Base includes wheels or casters that roll along a floor not shown as bed is moved from one location to another. A set of foot pedals is coupled to base and is used to brake and release casters .

Illustrative hospital bed has four siderail assemblies coupled to upper frame assembly as shown in . The four siderail assemblies include a pair of head siderail assemblies sometimes referred to as head rails and a pair of foot siderail assemblies sometimes referred to as foot rails . Each of the siderail assemblies is movable between a raised position as shown in and a lowered position not shown but well known to those skilled in the art . Siderail assemblies are sometimes referred to herein as siderails . Each siderail includes a barrier panel and a linkage . Each linkage is coupled to the upper frame assembly and is configured to guide the barrier panel during movement of siderails between the respective raised and lowered positions. Barrier panel is maintained by the linkage in a substantially vertical orientation during movement of siderails between the respective raised and lowered positions.

Upper frame assembly includes a lift frame a weigh frame supported with respect to lift frame and a patient support deck . Patient support deck is carried by weigh frame and engages a bottom surface of mattress . Patient support deck includes a head section a seat section a thigh section and a foot section in the illustrative example as shown in and as shown diagrammatically in .

Further alternatively or additionally GUI as well as some or all of control circuitry is carried by a housing that attaches to footboard as depicted in a pictorial representation or icon that appears on GUI as shown in . In some embodiments an air source such a blower or pump or compressor is also carried by housing along with associated pneumatic circuitry such as manifolds valves conduits and so forth.

Control circuitry receives user input commands sometimes referred to herein as simply user inputs from GUI when display screen is activated. The user input commands control various functions of bed such as controlling the pneumatic system and therefore the surface functions of surface . In some embodiments the input commands entered on GUI also control the functions of one or more of motors but this need not be the case. In some embodiments input commands entered on the user interface also control functions of a scale system which is discussed in more detail below. Various examples of the various alternative or additional functions of bed that are controlled by GUI in various embodiments can be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2012 0089419 A1 2008 0235872 A1 and 2008 0172789 A1 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies.

In some embodiments control circuitry of bed communicates with a remote computer device via communication infrastructure such as an Ethernet of a healthcare facility in which bed is located and via communications links as shown diagrammatically in . Infrastructure may be operated according to for example the IEEE 802.3 wired Ethernet standard and or the IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet standard. Computer device is sometimes simply referred to as a computer or a server herein. Remote computer may be part of a bed data system for example. One example of a bed data system is shown and described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 487 460 which was filed Jun. 4 2012 which was titled System and Method of Bed Data Aggregation Normalization and Communication to Third Parties and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. Alternatively or additionally it is within the scope of this disclosure for circuitry of bed to communicate with other computers such as those included as part of an electronic medical records EMR system a nurse call system a physician ordering system an admission discharge transfer ADT system or some other system used in a healthcare facility in other embodiments although this need not be the case. Ethernet in is illustrated diagrammatically and is intended to represent all of the hardware and software that comprises a network of a healthcare facility.

In the illustrative embodiment bed has a communication interface or port which provides bidirectional communication via link with infrastructure which in turn communicates bidirectionally with computer via link . Link is a wired communication link in some embodiments and is a wireless communications link in other embodiments. Thus communications link in some embodiments comprises a cable that connects bed to a wall mounted jack that is included as part of a bed interface unit BIU or a network interface unit NIU of the type shown and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 538 659 and 7 319 386 and in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2009 0217080 A1 2009 0212925 A1 and 2009 0212926 A1 each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. In other embodiments communications link comprises wireless signals sent between bed and a wireless interface unit or a wireless access point of the type shown and described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0210917 A1 which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. Thus communications link comprises one or more wired links and or wireless links as well according to this disclosure.

Referring now to a home screen of bed that appears on GUI in response to GUI being awakened out of a non interaction mode or screen saver mode includes a menu of icons for navigating to other screens. With regard to awakening GUI from the non interaction mode see U.S. application Ser. No. 13 360 846 which was filed Jan. 30 2012 which is titled Graphical Caregiver Interface with Swipe to Unlock Feature and which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. Menu includes a home icon sometimes referred to herein as a button a scale icon a mattress set up icon a moisture control icon and an alarm icon . Because home screen is being shown on GUI the corresponding home icon is highlighted in as indicated by the cross hatching on icon .

Icons are selectable by the user to navigate to one or more screens associated with those icons to gain access to bed data and to control features or functions of bed . For example in some embodiments selection of icon results in a scale control screen being displayed on GUI and that has one or more icons to permit the user to do one or more of the following set a tare weight for the scale system select whether pounds lb or kilograms kg are to be the units of measure for the patient s weight enter data for use in calculation of the patient s BMI or to take a weight reading. Selection of icon results in a screen that permits the user to control surface operations such as for example maximum inflate turn assist left turn assist right therapy modes and normal mode. Selection of icon therefore results in the user being able to navigate to screens to control therapy functions of mattress such as for example continuous lateral rotation therapy alternating pressure therapy percussion and or vibration therapy and low air loss or microclimate management functions. Selection of icon results in a screen that shows information about moisture levels in the mattress and displays controls to permit a user to select desired temperature and humidity thresholds or targets for a low air loss topper for example. Thus pneumatic system may have a temperature sensor and a humidity sensor along with heating cooling elements to control air temperature of the air delivered to surface and may have a variable speed blower the speed of which is controllable to move air through a low air loss topper to maintain the humidity below the selected humidity threshold.

A down arrow icon appears at the bottom of menu beneath icon and is selected to scroll downwardly to reveal other icons not shown of menu . An up arrow icon appears near the top of menu just above the home icon and is selected to scroll upwardly to reveal additional icons not shown of menu . Screen also has a bed icon or indicia that includes head angle data as shown in . In the illustrative example head angle data indicates that the head section of bed has been lowered to a position having an angle less than 30 . In some embodiments the position of the siderails of bed icon matches the position of actual siderails of bed . Thus if one of siderails is lowered then icon will show the corresponding siderail in a lowered position on home screen .

In the illustrative example screen also has a pair information icon including a surface status icon that indicates the state of operation of the surface such as normal maximum inflate left turn assist right turn assist rotation left rotation center rotation right percussion vibration OPTIREST mode e.g. a mode in which zones of the mattress such as the head seat thigh and foot zones are sequentially reduced in pressure one zone at a time to provide a wave effect for the patient seat deflate and sleep mode. The other information icon in is a turn assist icon that in the illustrative example is highlighted to indicate that surface of bed is having its turn assist function operated. A curved arrow is also displayed over icon to show that the turn assist function is being operated.

Screen further has a lock icon that is selected to dim the GUI and lock the GUI from use in a non interaction mode. Icon is selected for example when the caregiver intends to leave bed and go elsewhere or when the caregiver intends to lean over the siderail to which GUI is coupled so that inadvertent contact with GUI will not result in inadvertent button selections. Also on screen is a help icon which is selected to obtain help on GUI regarding the operation of bed or surface and a patient information icon or button which in the illustrative example of is highlighted to indicate that a patient s position on surface is not the optimal position for the turn assist function which is being operated. A text box also appears on screen and includes the text Patient NOT in Optimal Position for Turn. Thus the highlighting of icon such as by color coding of yellow or red or any other desired color and the message in text box serves to alert a caregiver that the patient on bed should be repositioned on surface . It should be noted that the term Optimal Position in the message of box refers to a range of areas that correspond to proper positions for the patient on surface . Once the patient is outside of the range or area of proper positions the patient is then considered to be in an improper position.

Referring now to an alternative home screen is shown after a caregiver has attempted to initiate the turn assist function of bed as indicated by icon being highlighted. However in the embodiment because the patient is not in the proper position on surface the turn assist function is suspended or blocked from operating. Text box appears to alert the caregiver that the patient is not in an optimal position. However instead of highlighting icon in the embodiment icon flashes as suggested by the lines radiating outwardly from icon in . Also an OK button or icon is provided on screen and is selected by the caregiver to abort the turn assist operation altogether. An Ignore button or icon is provided on screen and is selected to activate the turn assist function even though the patient is not in an optimal position. It is also worth noting that in the variant icon has been modified slightly to graphically represent that the patient has shifted toward a foot end of bed .

Referring now to another alternative home screen is shown after a caregiver has attempted to initiate a therapy function of bed . In this variant the therapy function does not operate and the patient information icon flashes at the top of screen . In response to the caregiver selecting the flashing icon on screen of the screen of results and includes text box and icons appearing on screen . Icons are used in the same manner as described above to abort the therapy altogether or to override the suspension of the therapy due to the patient being improperly positioned. It should be understood that even if the caregiver selects icon so that the therapy function or turn assist function proceeds as the case may be it is contemplated by this disclosure that one or more caregivers will move the patient to the proper position as the therapy or turn assist function proceeds.

As shown in a triangular patient position icon appears on the home screen at all times according to another variant of this disclosure. Icon is color coded green red or yellow depending upon whether the patient is in the proper position out of position by a first amount or out of position by a second amount greater than the first amount. In the illustrative example text box also appears on screen along with icon to indicate that the patient is not in the optimal position. Another embodiment is shown in in which patient information icon is shaded to indicate that the triangular patient position icon and or text box only appears on the home screen after the patient information icon is selected by a caregiver.

Referring now to an alternative home page screen is shown in which after the patient position icon is selected when the patient is properly positioned on the bed the text box appears and includes the message Patient is in correct position. Triangular hip icon appears to also indicate that the patient is in the correct position. Furthermore the patient is represented graphically on the bed in the proper position on icon .

According to this disclosure screens similar or identical to the home page screen shots of appear with text box if the patient has moved too far toward the head end or foot end respectively regardless of whether a turn assist function or therapy function has been initiated on bed . For example after head section of bed is raised and then lowered back down there is a tendency for the patient to shift toward foot end of bed . In such situations the screen of is displayed. In some instances caregivers assist the patient in moving back toward head end of bed and in other instances the patient may move themselves back toward the head end of bed . However if the caregivers move the patient too far toward the head end or if the patient moves himself or herself too far toward the head end then the situation will have been overcorrected. In such overcorrection situations the screen of is displayed. When the patient is in the proper position then the home page screen shot of is displayed.

In some embodiments screens of are used during a training mode of bed . In the training mode caregivers practice not pulling a patient too far up in bed after the patient has shifted toward the foot end . Such training may be performed using a patient using another person in lieu of a patient or using an anthropometric mannequin or the like. In such embodiments suitable screens are provided for turning off and on the training mode of bed .

With regard to sensing the patient s position relative to mattress and or bed frame there are many possible sensor technologies that may be employed according to this disclosure. Embodiments having a plurality of sensors that provide signals to indicate the position of the patient are contemplated by this disclosure. For example each sensor of the plurality of sensors may include a load cell a force sensitive resistor FSR element a piezoelectric material or element a capacitive sensor or an optical sensor. If load cells are used they may include strain gages or capacitors for example. Such sensors are included as part of scale system in some embodiments. Alternatively or additionally the patient support surface may have a plurality of patient support bladders and a plurality of sensors such as pressure sensors or other types of sensors that may be used to determine a position of the patient on the patient support surface based on signals from the sensors that may be indicative as to which of the plurality of bladders the patient is atop.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 276 432 and 7 253 366 provide examples of bed frames having load cells that are used to determine patient position and each of these patents is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 208 250 and 7 464 605 provide examples of the use of FSR s to determine patient position and each of these patents is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. U.S. Pat. No. 6 067 019 provides examples of the use of capacitive sensors to determine patent position and is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. U.S. Pat. No. 6 819 254 provides an example of the use of piezoelectric material to determine patient position and is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. U.S. Pat. No. 7 409 735 provides examples of the use of pressure sensors associated with air bladders to determine patient position and is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure which shall control as to any inconsistencies. Some of the other U.S. patents already incorporated by reference herein also include various types of sensors for determining patient position.

While the improper positioning of the patient in the embodiments discussed above was within the context of performing a therapy function or a turn assist function the present disclosure also contemplates that indications on graphical display screen similar or identical to those in shown in may alternatively or additionally be displayed in connection with raising head section of frame toward a raised position. The head section is movable in a known manner between a raised position supporting the patient in a sitting up position and a lowered position supporting the patient in a lying down position. It is contemplated that user inputs GUI or both are configured to receive user inputs from a caregiver to initiate the movement of head section between the raised and lowered positions. However if the patient is improperly positioned on bed such as being slid too far toward the head end or the foot end of frame the GUI is controlled by control circuitry to display information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned on bed for the movement of head section toward the raised position.

In some embodiments the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned includes may include one or more of the following i a text box with a message conveying the information ii a pictorial representation of a patient lying on the patient support surface too close to the at least one of the head end and foot end and iii a hip position icon that is color coded. In connection with text box the message states for example Patient NOT in Optimal Position for Raising the Head Section in lieu of the text shown in the illustrative examples of . Similarly the text shown in may be included when the patient is properly positioned and the text in box in may also be included in text box in connection with attempts to raise head section in some embodiments.

In some embodiments the movement of head section toward the raised position may be suspended until after the caregiver selects first icon on screen of the GUI to ignore the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned. Alternatively the movement of head section toward the raised position may be prevented altogether by circuitry until after the patient is moved to a proper position on the patient support structure .

As discussed above bed frame has a plurality of sensors that are part of scale system and that are used to determine a weight of the patient. Some or all of these sensors are also used to determine a position of the patient on the patient support surface and or frame . Frame and surface either individually or together are considered to be a patient support structure according to this disclosure. It is contemplated that in some embodiments the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned is displayed on the GUI prior to the caregiver using the user inputs to initiate the raising of head section . In other embodiments the information indicating that the patient is improperly positioned is displayed only after an attempt is made to raise head section .

In some embodiments the information regarding whether a patient is or is not properly positioned in connection with raising the head section is only displayed in those instances when head section is below a threshold angle. The threshold angle may be for example 30 degrees or 45 degrees or some other angle according to this disclosure. This is because once the head section has been raised by the threshold amount the sensors on bed will have readings indicating that the patient has moved too far toward foot end regardless of whether or not the patient is properly positioned. That is raising the head section shifts the patient s weight toward the foot end of bed even when the patient is properly positioned.

Although certain illustrative embodiments have been described in detail above many embodiments variations and modifications are possible that are still within the scope and spirit of this disclosure as described herein and as defined in the following claims.
