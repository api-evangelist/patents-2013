The number of portable electronic devices for example smartphones have grown exponentially in recent years. Additionally and in parallel the number of applications for example mobile applications supported by these portable electronic devices have also been rapidly growing since the inception of portable electronic device. These applications once installed on a portable electronic device may provide several functionalities to a user of the portable electronic device.

To address to the growing demand of applications application providers develop hundreds of thousands of applications that may be downloaded at the portable electronic devices. However due to the large number of available applications the users of the portable electronic devices may be overwhelmed when searching for relevant applications for their devices. Determining relevant applications for installing at a portable electronic device may therefore be confusing and time consuming.

Embodiments of techniques for recommending applications to portable electronic devices are described herein. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment this embodiment and similar phrases means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

For recommending applications to a portable electronic device initially at context change of application identification parameters is detected. An application identification parameter may be any observable occurrence or phenomenon. For example hour of the day current date month weather condition physical location of a user proximity of a user to a Wi Fi network etc. may be application identification parameters. A context may represent a value for a particular application identification parameter. For example the context of a location application identification parameter may be home office or any other location of the user. A context change may represent a change in value for the application identification parameter. For example a context change of the location application identification parameter may be when user moves from a home location to office location . The context of the different application identification parameters may be monitored to detect context change of a particular application identification parameter.

Next at a target application is identified based on the detected context change at . In one embodiment a target application is an application associated with a particular context of an application identification parameter. For example a financial or banking application that helps users perform tax calculation and other financial calculations may be associated with the financial year end context of the time of year application identification parameter. Identifying the target application may include identifying the application associated with the changed context detected at of the application identification parameter. In the example discussed in the previous paragraph a finance assistant application associated with the changed context office of the location application identification parameter may be identified.

Next at a similarity value is computed between the identified target application and other applications. Other applications may be applications other than the target application identified at . A similarity value is a measure of similarity between the identified application and other applications. In one embodiment the similarity value may be computed based on comparing several attributes for example application tags application category etc. of the identified target application and the other application. In the example described in the previous paragraph the identified finance assistant application may include application tags finance calculator currency converter loan comparator and profit . A similarity value may be determined between the finance assistant target application and two other applications a banking application that includes application tags finance banking profit balance amount and fund transfer and a market live application that includes application tags finance market stocks profit and portfolio . Based on comparing the application tags the similarity value between the finance assistant application and the banking application may be determined as 0.9 and between the finance assistant application and market live application may be determined as 0.6. The similarity value may be determined using different similarity value determination process for example Pearson r correlation method.

Finally at the to be recommended applications are determined based on the computed similarity value and rate value of other applications. The to be recommended applications may be applications that are recommended to the portable electronic device. In one embodiment a rate value may indicate a positive or negative recommendation for the application by the target user. The rate value and the similarity value of other applications are used to determine the to be recommended applications for the portable electronic device.

In the example described with respect to assume that the rate values for the banking application and the market live application are 4 and 3 respectively. In this case based on the product of rate value and the computed similarity value the banking application is determined as to be recommended application for the portable electronic device. The to be recommended application may be forwarded to the portable electronic device. A user of the portable electronic device may then discard the recommended application or install the received recommended application.

Determining to be recommended application based on context change of application identification parameters and rate values of application ensures that user s environment and user s preference respectively are considered to determine the application recommendations for the user.

Next at based on the monitoring at context change of an application identification parameter is detected. A context change may represent a change in value of the application identification parameter. In one embodiment the context change may be detected for several application identification parameters based on the monitoring at . In the example described in the previous paragraph the user may travel to other city ABC due to which the context of the location application identification parameter changes from home to city ABC .

Next at based on the context change detected at a target application may be identified. A target application is an application corresponding to the changed context detected at of the application identification parameter. In the example described in the previous paragraph a city ABC map application may be identified. In one embodiment several target applications may be identified corresponding to the context change detected at . In the example described in the previous paragraph several target applications may be identified corresponding to the changed context city ABC of the location application identification parameter.

In another example a context of a weather application identification parameter may change from summer context to winter context . In this case a ski resorts application winter garments outlet application and winter driving application may be identified as target applications corresponding to the changed context winter of the weather application identification parameter. In one embodiment a target application may be detected corresponding to context change of several application identification parameters. For example based on the context change of a location application identification parameter from home to city ABC and a time application identification parameter which detects the time elapsed since the user is away from their home location from zero hours to twenty four hours a hotels in city ABC target application may be identified.

In one embodiment the relationship between context of an application identification parameter and corresponding target application may be pre determined. For example a pre determined relationship between application identification parameter and application may be that when the context of weather application identification parameter is summer then the corresponding application is beach resorts application. The pre determined relationship between the context of the application and the corresponding target application is used for identifying the target application.

Next at an un rated and to be installed target application from the target application identified at is detected. The un rated and to be installed application may be detected from the several target applications identified at . In one embodiment an un rated target application is an application that has not been rated by a target user. The target user may be a user of the portable electronic device. A rate value may indicate a positive or negative recommendation for the application by the target user. A rate value is an evaluation or assessment of a particular item in terms of quantity or quality or any other parameter. In one embodiment the rate value may be provided for example on a scale of 1 to 5. A rate value of 5 may represent that a user has positively rated the application. The user may rate the application positively in terms of several parameters for example relevance ease of use application size etc. Rate values of 1 4 represent explicit rate values provided by the user for the application where a higher rate value represents a more positive feedback by the user. In one embodiment a rate value of 2 is automatically assigned to the application when the application is installed to the portable electronic device. A rate value of 0 implies that an application is an un rated application. A rate value of 1 represents a negative recommendation by the user for the application.

In one embodiment a to be installed target application is a target application that has not been installed at the portable electronic device. An unrated i.e. application with rate value 0 that has not been installed at the portable device is determined from the target application identified at . Next at the rate value of the un rated and to be installed target application determined at is incremented. In one embodiment the rate value of the un rated and to be installed target application is incremented by 1. In the example described with respect to assume that the winter driving application is the un rated and to be installed application from among the three target applications corresponding to the winter context of the weather application identification parameter. In this case the rate value of the winter driving application is incremented by 1.

Next at a check is performed to determine whether there are other applications rated by the target user. Other applications may include applications different from the target application identified at . In one embodiment other application may be a co rated application with respect to the target application. Two applications are co rated when both the applications are rated by same user. The same user may be the target user or any other user. The other application co rated with respect to the target application may also be rated by the same user. In case other application rated by the target user exist condition in is true a similarity value may be computed at between the target application and the other applications determined at . A similarity value is a measure of similarity between a target application and the other application. In one embodiment the similarity value may be individually computed between target application and the determined other applications. For example consider that there are two target applications a a and two other applications o o rated by the target user. In this case four similarity values S S S and S may be computed between the target applications a a and the other applications o o . Computing similarity values between target application and other co rated applications reduces the number of other applications for which the similarity values are computed. This reduces the time for computing the similarity value between the target applications and other applications. In the example described with respect to assume that there are two other applications ice museum application and winter park applications and three target applications ski resorts application winter garments outlet application and winter driving application rated by the same user. In this case six similarity values may be computed between the three target applications and the two other applications.

In one embodiment the similarity value may be computed based on the similarity between attributes of identified application and other application. The attributes of an application may include for example target Operating System on which the application is supported for example iOS Android etc. an application kind for example whether application is a free application or a paid application category to which the application belongs for example banking games news educational etc. application type native or container based application tag etc. Applications of native application type are executed using Operating System of the portable electronic device whereas applications of container application type may use custom containers for execution. Application tag provides the information about an application. The similarity value may be computed for example based on the similarity between the target Operating Systems kind category application type and or tags of the target application and the other application.

In one embodiment the similarity value between target application and other application may be computed using any similarity computation method for example cosine based similarity method adjusted cosine similarity method or correlation based similarity method. For cosine based similarity the identified application and other application are considered as two vectors. A cosine based similarity method measures similarity between the target application vector and the other application vector by computing the cosine of the angle between the target application and other application. Two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity value of 1 two vectors at 90 have a similarity value of 0 and two vectors diametrically opposite to each other have a similarity value of 1. Based on the cosine based similarity method the similarity value between the target application and other application may be 1 0 or 1.

The correlation based similarity Sbetween two applications i and j respectively rated by the target user may be computed by determining the Pearson r correlation between the target application and other application. Pearson r correlation is a measure of the linear correlation dependence between the target application i and other application j giving a value between 1 and 1 inclusive where 1 is total positive correlation 0 is no correlation and 1 is negative correlation. The Pearson r correlation may be computed using the following formula 

In case other application rated by the target user is not identified condition in is false then the similarity value is computed between the target application and other application included in an application cluster at . An application cluster may be a group of applications grouped based on a particular attribute. For example applications may be grouped in two application clusters based on two application categories education and games respectively. In this case the two application clusters include applications with application category education and games respectively.

In one embodiment the similarity value is computed between the target application and other applications of an application cluster that includes the target application. The similarity value may be computed between the target application and other co rated applications in the application cluster. In this case the target application and the other co rated application have been rated by another user different from the target user. The application cluster may be checked to identify other co rated application. The similarity value may then be computed individually between the target application and the other co rated application included in the application cluster. The similarity value may be computed using the different similarity computation methods discussed above with respect to . In the example described above with respect to assume that there are two application clusters grouped according to the application categories sports and business . In this case the ski resorts application and winter driving application may be included in the application cluster corresponding to the sports category. Similarly the winter garments outlet application may be included in the application cluster corresponding to the commerce category. A similarity value may be computed between the target ski resorts winter driving application and other co rated application included in the application cluster corresponding to the sports category. Similarly a similarity value may be computed between the winter garment application and the other co rated application included in the application cluster corresponding to the commerce category.

Next at based on the computed similarity value a pre determined number of other applications corresponding to the target application may be identified. The pre determined number of other applications may be selected from the other applications the similarity value of which are computed at and with respect to the target application. In one embodiment other applications may be arranged in descending order based on the computed similarity values between the target application and other applications. The pre determined number of other application may then be selected from the beginning of the obtained list of other application. In one embodiment the pre determined number of other applications may represent a minimum number of other applications similar to the target application. Next at the pre determined number of other applications selected at may be stored. The target application and the corresponding pre determined number of other applications may be stored together in a database. In one embodiment the target application the corresponding other applications and the similarity value of other applications with respect to the target application may be stored together.

In one embodiment the similarity value may be pre computed before monitoring context of the application identification parameters at . During the pre computation process similarity values may be computed between the applications corresponding to different application identification parameters and the other application a pre determined number of the other applications may then be selected based on the determined similarity value and the selected pre determined number of other applications corresponding to an application may be stored along with their similarity values. In this case the other applications corresponding to the target application identified at may be retrieved and then used for determining the application recommendation. Pre computing other application corresponding to a target application reduces computation time for determining the similarity value after a context change of application identification parameter is detected and therefore reduces the time for determining applications recommendation.

Next at a number of to be installed target applications are determined. The number of to be installed applications may be a count of the number of target applications that are not installed at the portable electronic device. Next at the determined number of to be installed applications is compared with a pre determined number of to be recommended applications. In one embodiment the pre determined number of to be recommended applications is the maximum number of application recommendations that may be sent to the portable electronic device. The comparison is performed to determine whether the number of to be installed applications is equal to the pre determined number of to be recommended applications.

In case the number of to be installed target applications is not equal to the pre determined number of to be recommended applications condition in is false then a pre determined number of other applications corresponding to the to be installed target application may be retrieved. In one embodiment the other applications stored at corresponding to the to be installed target application may be retrieved. For example consider that six target applications are identified and one of these target application is installed at the portable electronic device. Assume that the five to be installed target applications have six other applications stored corresponding to these applications. Further assume that the pre determined number of application recommendations that may be sent to the portable electronic device is 2. In this case as the number of to be installed target applications 5 is not equal to the pre determined number 2 of target applications therefore the six other applications corresponding to the five to be installed target applications may be retrieved.

Next at predicted value is computed for the retrieved other applications and the to be installed target applications. A predicted value represents a likelihood of the application to be relevant for recommendation to the portable electronic device. The predicted value for the other application is computed based on the similarity value of the other application with respected to the target application and the rate value of the other application. In one embodiment rated other application from among other applications retrieved at are identified. A rated other application may be one or more of other applications retrieved at that has a rate value. The predicted value may be computed for the rated other application and the to be installed target application. In the example described in the previous paragraph the predicted value may be computed for the six other applications and the five to be installed target applications.

The predicted value for the to be installed identified application is determined based on the rate value of the to be installed identified application. In this case the similarity value of the to be installed application is considered as 100 or 1. In one embodiment the predicted value may be determined based on any prediction computation method for example weighted sum method or the regression method. In the weighted sum method the rate value Rof other application j is weighted by the corresponding similarity value sbetween other application j and the target application i. The obtained value is then divided by the sum of the similarities sbetween the other applications j and the target application i to obtain the predicted value Pfor an application i rated by a target user u. The predicted value Pmay be computed using the following formula 

Similarly in the regression method approximation of rate value instead of the actual rate value provided to the rated other applications are used for determining the predicted value. Next at the to be recommended applications are determined based on the predicted value computed at . In one embodiment the rated other applications and the to be installed target applications are arranged in descending order of the corresponding predicted value. A pre determined number of applications from the beginning of the arranged applications are then determined as the to be recommended application. The pre determined number used for determining the to be recommended application may be the pre determined maximum number of to be recommended applications. In the example described with respect to the six other applications and the five to be installed target applications may be arranged according to the corresponding predicted value of these applications. In this case assume that the pre determined number of to be recommended applications is five then five applications from the arranged eleven applications six other applications and the five to be installed target applications may be determined as the to be recommended applications.

In one embodiment when the number of to be installed identified application is equal to the predetermined number of to be recommended applications condition in is true then a check is performed to determine whether the to be installed identified application include a rated application at . A rated application is an application rated by the target user or any other user. In case the to be installed identified application include a rated application condition in in true then the steps in are repeated to determine the to be recommended applications. Alternatively when the to be installed application does not include a rated application condition in in false then the to be installed identified application is determined as the to be recommended application .

Finally at the to be recommended applications determined at and are forwarded to the portable electronic device. The user of the portable electronic device may then install the received recommended application or reject the received application recommendation.

When the pre determined time option is selected for triggering application recommendation generation process a user of the portable electronic device may be requested to provide a time at which the user wants to trigger the determination of application recommendation. In one embodiment for the time based application recommendation determination processes and may be executed before triggering the application recommendation generation process. Further may be executed when the application recommendation generation process is triggered. Initially at a selection of user preference tags is received. The selection of the user preference tags may be received at the portable electronic device from a user of the portable electronic device. A user at the portable electronic device may manually select the user preference tags. User preference tags are tags that define the user s preferences for applications. For example a user s preference tag may be sports and live in this case sports channels that broadcast live sports matches may be the applications that the user prefer to receive as recommendation. Next at a set of applications may be associated with the user preference tags. In one embodiment the set of applications are automatically associated with the user preference tags. For example an ABC sports channel application and a XYZ sports channel application may be automatically associated with the user preference tags sports and live .

Next at the other applications corresponding to installed applications and to be installed application associated with the user preference tag respectively are retrieved. The installed applications may be the applications installed at the portable electronic device. In one embodiment the pre determined number of other applications stored at of corresponding to the installed applications may be retrieved at . For retrieving the to be installed application associated with the application tag the applications associated with the user preference tag which have not been installed at the portable electronic device may be identified. The other applications corresponding to the identified to be installed applications associated with the user preference tag may then be retrieved.

Next at a predicted value is computed for other applications retrieved at . The predicted value may be computed based on the rate value of other applications and the similarity value of other applications with respect to the installed applications and the to be installed applications associated with the user preference tag respectively. The predicted value may be computed using one of the different prediction value generation options described in reference to of .

Next at other applications from applications retrieved at are selected based on the predicted value computed at . The other applications retrieved at may be arranged in descending order of the corresponding predicted value. A pre determined number of the other applications may be selected at . The pre determined number may be the maximum number of applications that may be recommended to the portable electronic device.

Finally at the selected other application are determined as the to be recommended applications. The determined to be recommended application may be forwarded to the portable electronic device.

Initially at the social network activities of the target user and members of the social network are compared. The social network activities may include installing applications providing recommendations for a particular application etc. Comparing the social network activities may include comparing applications downloaded by the target user and any other member on the social network comparing applications rated by the target user and members of the social network etc. In one embodiment comparing the social network activities may include comparing whether similar applications have been downloaded by the target user and any other member on the social network etc. Similar applications may include applications having some attributes same as the attributes of the applications installed by the target user. Based on the comparison at a member of the social network that has performed similar network activities as the target user is identified at . The identified member of the social network may have installed same applications as the target user or may have provided feedback for the same applications as the user. For example a target user may have downloaded a car racing game or may have rated a Formula 1 race. In this case any other member that has downloaded the car racing game or have rated the Formula 1 race may be identified.

Finally at the applications installed by the identified member are determined as to be recommended applications. In one embodiment the applications installed by the identified member that has not been installed by the target user of the portable electronic device are determined as the to be recommended application.

The publisher interface may also receive a request to upload the application to the application discovery sever . In one embodiment the uploaded application may be stored in a database included in the application discovery server . The publisher interface may also receive a link to an application store that may be used for installing the application. An application store for example Google Play store or Apple App Store is a digital distribution platform for application software. The application store link for a recommended application may be forwarded to the portable electronic device along with the recommended application. A user of the portable electronic device may download the application from the application store using the received application store link.

The publisher interface allows a user to select application discovery parameters for an application. The application discovery parameters are parameters based on which an application may be discovered at a portable electronic device. In one embodiment the application discovery parameters are application identification parameters that may be used for identifying an application. For example a location application discovery parameter selected by the user may be an application identification parameter. When the location parameter is selected then the user may be requested to provide an application coordinates at which the application is discoverable. When the target user reaches the application coordinates context defined for the location application identification parameters then the corresponding application is identified as a target application. In one embodiment the selected application discovery parameters may be used for determining the similarity value of the target application with respect to the other applications. For example when an application tag parameter is selected as the application discovery parameter then application tag is one of the parameters used for determining similarity values between the application and other application. Similarly when the user s usage history options is selected then user s past actions like frequently visited locations by the user notification received by the user actions taken per notification applications installed by user frequency of application installation by user etc. may be considered for determining the to be recommended applications.

In one embodiment the application discovery parameter may allow a user to select an application recommendation triggering mode for triggering the application recommendation determination process. The application recommendation triggering mode may include a system triggered mode and a user triggered mode. In case the system triggered mode is selected by the user the application may be discovered based on an identified context change for an application identification parameter or based on the identified other applications similar to installed applications at pre determined times. In case the user triggered option is selected then the user may trigger the application recommendation generation process by selecting a recommendation search recommendation refresh option at the portable electronic device.

The application discovery server includes an application recommendation module that determines the to be recommended applications for the portable electronic device. The application recommendation module includes a context aware pre processor that detects context change of different application identification parameters. The context aware pre processor then provides the changed context of the application identification parameter to an application identifier . An application identifier included in the application recommendation module then identifies the application corresponding to the received context of application identification parameters. An application recommendation determiner included in the application recommendation module then computes the similarity value between the identified application and other applications and the predicted value of other applications as discussed with respect to . The application recommendation determiner may then determine the to be recommended applications based on the computed predicted value as discussed with respect to .

The application recommendation module also includes a social network based filter that identifies other members of a social network that have similar social network activities as the target user. The social network based filter then provides the list of applications installed by the other member to the application recommendation determiner that determines the received list of applications as the to be installed application.

In one embodiment the application discovery server includes a scheduler that sends an application recommendation generation request to the application recommendation determiner at pre determined intervals or when a user of the portable electronic device sends a refresh application recommendation request. The application recommendation determiner then generates the to be recommended applications based on the applications installed at the portable electronic device and the user preference tags selected by the user. The application discovery server may also include a user s usage history management module that stores user related information for example frequently visited location by user notifications received by user actions taken by user per notification etc. The stored user related information is provided to the application recommendation module for determining the to be recommended applications.

The application recommendation management system also includes an application discovery agent. In one embodiment the application discovery agent may be included in the portable electronic device . The application discovery agent may forward a received rate value of application from the portable electronic device to the application discovery server for determining the to be recommended applications. The application discovery agent also receives the to be recommended applications forwarded to the portable electronic device . The application discovery agent also monitors context of the different application identification parameters and provides this information to the context aware pre processor . The received to be recommended applications may then be displayed at a user interface of the portable electronic device .
