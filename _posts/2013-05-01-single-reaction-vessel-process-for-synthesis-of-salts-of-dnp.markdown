The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention is directed to energetic materials and in particular to a method for the synthesis of KDNP a lead free replacement to lead styphnate.

There is growing interest in the manufacture and scale up of alternative replacements to heavy metal containing energetic materials based on regulatory changes and clean up costs associated with heavy metal waste. The compound potassium 5 7 dinitro 2 1 3 benzoxadiazol 4 olate 3 oxide KDNP has been qualified by the Navy as a primary explosive and is being developed as a suitable replacement for lead styphnate.

Previous attempts to synthesize KDNP however have resulted in bench scale quantities of the compound that required multiple steps for the synthesis of KDNP. For example the method reported by Fronabarger et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 8 062 443 and KDNP A Lead Free Replacement for Lead Styphnate Propellants Explos. Pyrotech 36 pages 459 470 2011 requires several laboratory operations to convert BTNA to KDNP including the use of multiple solvents and separation steps in the preparation of KDNP. Therefore an efficient and commercially viable process is desired for the synthesis and production of larger quantities of KDNP using a minimal number of processing steps.

Exemplary embodiments of systems and methods in accordance with the present invention provide a method for the synthesis of salts of 5 7 dinitro 2 1 3 benzoxadiazol 4 olate 3 oxide DNP and in particular potassium DNP KDNP from 3 bromo 2 4 6 trinitroanisole BTNA using a single reaction vessel process as well as other salts of DNP. A process for synthesizing KDNP from BTNA is utilized such that simple and efficient production of KDNP can be achieved in commercially viable quantities from a single batch reactor process having a minimal number of steps. The process includes adding KNto a reactor vessel containing BTNA and water HO heating the mixture at about 90 C. for up to 7 hours cooling the mixture to about room temperature about 20 C. to about 25 C. mixing the solution for up to about 12 hours and recovering the resulting KDNP precipitate through filtration. A continuously aqueous solution is maintained throughout the process such that KDNP is retained in the liquid as a precipitate upon completion of the reaction and is directly filtered from the solution.

Referring to an exemplary embodiment for the synthesis of a salt of 5 7 dinitro 2 1 3 benzoxadiazol 4 olate 3 oxide DNP and in particular potassium DNP KDNP in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. The synthesis is achieved in a single reaction vessel using a process that in addition to generating about 10 mg to about 1 gram of KDNP can be scaled to commercial production of KDNP in amounts of from about 1 gram to about 1 Kg or more. Large scale commercialization is facilitated by the single reaction vessel batch process as well as the use of a minimum number of reaction steps and the elimination of non aqueous solvents.

A quantity of 3 bromo 2 4 6 trinitroanisole BTNA is added to the single reaction vessel along with an azide and a solvent. Suitable azides include the alkali metal azides for example sodium and potassium. Other azides include organic azide salts. The use of other azide salts in the process would lead to other salts of 5 7 dinitro 2 1 3 benzoxadiazol 4 olate 3 oxide. Systems and methods in accordance with the present invention can be used to produce any desired salt of DNP from an azide in a single reaction vessel at desired commercially viable quantities. In an exemplary embodiment the azide is potassium azide KN .

The resulting solution is in an exemplary embodiment an aqueous solution and the solvent is water HO . However a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art would understand that a variety of high boiling organic solvents may also be used. The reaction components may be combined in any order or sequence suitable to effectuate the reaction of BTNA with the azide in the solvent. Preferably the azide is added to a reaction vessel containing a pre mixed starter slurry of the solvent and BTNA. In one embodiment the starter slurry is pre mixed at a ratio of BTNA to solvent e.g. water of from about 1.15 g of BTNA to from about 3.4 to about 10 mL of solvent. In one embodiment the BTNA and azide i.e. KN are added to the single reaction vessel at a mol ratio BTNA Azide of from about 1 1 to about 1 2.1.

The single reaction vessel containing the BTNA azide and solvent mixture is heated to a predetermined temperature and maintained at that predetermined temperature for a given period of time in order to react the ETNA azide and solvent. Suitable methods for heating include using a water bath in order to provide even heating and to maintain a consistent temperature. In one embodiment the predetermined temperature is at least about 90 C. This temperature is maintained for up to about 7 hours preferably up to about 3 hours.

Following the given period of time the heated and reacted mixture of BTNA azide and solvent is cooled. Active cooling e.g. in an ice bath or cool water bath can be used or the single reaction vessel is allowed to cool to room temperature passively overnight. In one embodiment the single reaction vessel and the reacted mixture of BTNA azide and solvent is cooled to a range of about 20 C. to about 25 C. over a period of time of about 12 hours.

The reacted and cooled mixture of BTNA azide and solvent is agitated e.g. mechanically mixed or stirred in the single reaction vessel for a predetermined period of time. In one embodiment the predetermined period of time is up to about 3 hours.

The resulting salt of DNP e.g. KDNP is recovered from the single reaction vessel as a precipitate e.g. a light brown solid. Preferably the KDNP precipitate is recovered by filtration. As the synthesis is conducted in a continuously aqueous system a facile recovery step of KDNP by filtration of the precipitate from the solution can be used. This is in contrast to past attempts which required an evaporation step of the solution to dryness followed by a re dissolving step before KDNP could be synthesized and ultimately recovered.

In addition to the KDNP the reaction generates potassium bromide KBr when potassium azide is used and potentially methyl azide CHN as by products. The KBr remains in the aqueous solution during filtration. The CHNis a gas that bubbles out of the single reaction vessel.

Reaction conditions for example the time for each step as well as the type and speed of mixing can be varied to affect KDNP precipitate crystal formation. Discrete needles can be formed with a length of about 304 m and a width of about 29 m. A faster crystallization process yields agglomerates of rods where each rod has a width of about 43 m and a length of from about 61 m to about 131 m. In one embodiment at least one crystal habit modifier can be added to the single reaction vessel in order to influence crystal morphology and crystal size of the KDNP. Suitable crystal habit modifiers include but are not limited to TWEEN 60 polyethylene glycol sorbitan monostearate methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. In another embodiment changes to cooling rates and reaction concentration can influence crystal morphology and size. Alternatively a separate recrystallization step using organic solvents may afford control of crystal morphology.

Systems and methods in accordance with the present invention provide the benefit of using a single reaction vessel with a reduced number of steps to produce KDNP from BTNA. The method can be scaled to larger reaction vessels to rapidly produce greater quantities of KDNP in a single batch process. Further retaining KDNP product in the liquid phase is a desirable improvement over past attempts since the compound can be directly filtered from the solution. Therefore the present invention is a suitable replacement for known methods to synthesize KDNP and can be used in commercial processes for large scale production of the compound.

In one exemplary embodiment for the synthesis of KDNP in accordance with the present invention a round bottomed flask i.e. the single reaction vessel was charged with a magnetic stir bar BTNA 1.15 g 3.57 mmol and water 3.4 mL and the resulting slurry was stirred vigorously using a heat magnetic stir plate. To this slurry was added KN 0.61 g 7.50 mmol 2.1 equiv and the resulting mixture was heated to 90 C. in a water bath for 3 hours. Upon cooling to room temperature a precipitate formed and the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature overnight. The product was filtered washed with ice chilled water 3 and air dried to afford KDNP 0.77 g as a brownish orange solid. H and C NMR and DSC data matched reported values for KDNP.
