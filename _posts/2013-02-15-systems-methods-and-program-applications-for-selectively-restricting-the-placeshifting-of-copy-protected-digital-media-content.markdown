This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 623 955 filed Nov. 23 2009 issued Feb. 19 2013 as U.S. Pat. No. 8 381 310 and claiming priority to Indian Patent Application No. 1922 CHE 2009 entitled SYSTEMS METHODS AND PROGRAM APPLICATIONS FOR SELECTIVELY RESTRICTING THE PLACESHIFTING OF COPY PROTECTED DIGITAL MEDIA CONTENT filed on Aug. 13 2009 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to systems methods and program applications for selectively restricting the placeshifting of copy protected digital media content.

In the past consumers generally viewed television programming and other streaming media content as it was received from a network broadcast cable or satellite source. As analog and digital recording devices e.g. video cassette recorders as well as digital personal video recorders became more prevalent consumers were increasingly able to temporally shift their media viewing to more convenient viewing times. More recently the ability to placeshift media viewing from one location to another has become more widespread. For example SLING MEDIA of Foster City Calif. currently markets placeshifting products under the trademark SLINGBOX that enable consumers to remotely view on a display device such as a laptop computer desktop computer or mobile phone television programming provided from a receiver residing in a different physical location than does the display device.

At present digital media content is primarily placeshifted from a receiver or recorder over a digital network to a personal computer wireless phone or other portable device. However consumers are becoming increasingly interested in non traditional sources of digital media content typically viewed on a computer display such as streaming video received via the Internet or other network. In addition many consumers now possess video cameras or other equipment for generating their own content. Much of this content is in digital format that is most readily viewed on a personal computer or other digital computing device. A commercial demand has thus developed for the ability to placeshift video content from a personal computer to a remotely located television or other display. However a concern has arisen that should consumers be provided with the capacity to placeshift video content from a personal computer to a remotely located television or other remote display the video content appearing on the remotely located television could be recorded utilizing a video cassette recorder a digital video recorder or similar device connected to the television and thereby circumvent any copy protection measures associated with the video content originating from the personal computer.

Thus there exists an ongoing commercial need to provide systems methods and program products that enable digital media content to be placeshifted from a computer system to a remotely located television or other display while also selectively restricting the placeshifting of copy protected digital media content to deter improper copying. These and other desirable features and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent Detailed Description and the appended Claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings and the foregoing Background.

Embodiments of a method executable by a computer system are provided. In one embodiment a method includes the steps of capturing digital media content rendered on the local display by a media player application executed by the computer system determining whether the media player application is accessing copy protected digital media content and if the media player application is not accessing copy protected digital media content converting the captured digital media content to a media stream and transmitting the media stream over a network for presentation on a remote display.

Embodiments of a computer readable medium are further provided that includes instructions stored thereon executable by a computer system to transmit digital media content over a network to a remote display. In one embodiment the instructions includes a placeshifting program application adapted to perform steps of capturing digital media content rendered on a local display associated with the computer system by a media player application executed by the computer system converting the captured digital media content to a media stream in a network transmittable format transmitting the media stream over the network for presentation on the remote display determining whether the media player application is accessing a copy protected digital media file and blocking transmission of the media stream if it is determined that the media player application is accessing a copy protected digital media file.

Embodiments of a computer system are further provided for placeshifting digital media content in conjunction with a digital network and a remote display. In one embodiment the computer system includes a first interface to the digital network a second interface to a local display and a processor operatively coupled to the first interface and to the second interface. The processor is configured to selectively execute at least one media player application to render digital media content on the local display. The processor is further configured to i capture at least a portion of the digital media content rendered on the local display ii convert the captured digital media content to a media stream in a network transmittable format iii transmit the media stream over the network for presentation on the remote display iv determine whether the media player application is accessing a copy protected digital media file and v block transmission of the media stream if the media player application is accessing copy protected digital media content.

Various additional embodiments aspects and other features of the present invention are described in more detail below.

The following Detailed Description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding Background or the following detailed description.

A digital network permits communication between computer system and digital media playback receiver . More specifically digital network enables computer system to transmit streaming media content to digital media playback receiver for playback on remote display . Digital network can comprise any communication network enabling the streaming of media content and specifically the streaming of video content from computer system to playback receiver in this manner. In instances wherein digital media playback receiver is located relatively far away from computer system e.g. when playback receiver and computer system reside in separate buildings network conveniently includes one or more public or private data connections links or networks supporting any number of communications protocols. Network can also include the Internet or any other network based upon TCP IP or other conventional protocols. The foregoing notwithstanding DM placeshifting system will typically assume the form of a wide area network a local area network or a combination of wide and local area networks as indicated in . For example in one common scenario wherein DM placeshifting system is implemented within a relatively small geographical area e.g. within a user s home office or other structure network may comprise one or more local area networks conforming to IEEE 802.3 and or IEEE 802.11 standards. Network as illustrated in then is intended to broadly encompass any digital communications network s systems or architectures for transmitting data between the various components of system .

In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in DM placeshifting system further includes at least one server communicatively coupled to computer system and digital media playback receiver through digital network . In certain embodiments server can be a conventional Internet server configured to interact with a browser or viewer application executing on digital media playback receiver to provide images audio video and or other content. In further embodiments server can be a web server linked to other content servers made available to digital media playback receiver . In such embodiments a user may direct digital media playback receiver to initially contact server and subsequently direct digital media playback receiver to follow hypertext markup language HTML or other links provided by server . Many different interface options are available across a wide array of equivalent implementations to allow digital media playback receiver to obtain media content from any number of servers .

Digital media playback receiver is conveniently although not necessarily capable of receiving digital media from sources other than computer system and possibly server . For example as indicated in digital media playback receiver may also selectively receive digital media from at least one additional placeshifting device included within DM placeshifting system and communicatively coupled to playback receiver via network . If provided additional placeshifting device will typically include transcoder logic for converting digital media content e.g. video audio data into a packetized format e.g. MPEG QUICKTIME WINDOWS MEDIA and or the like suitable for transmission over network in the commonly known manner. In addition to or in lieu of additional placeshifting device DM placeshifting system may further include an auxiliary volume storage device locally connected to digital media playback receiver . Auxiliary volume storage device can be combined with playback receiver as a single freestanding electronic device. Alternatively auxiliary volume storage device can comprise an external device that is connected to playback receiver utilizing one or more connector cables. Auxiliary volume storage device may be an optical hard disk drive a magnetic hard disk drive a flash memory drive or similar memory device on which a user may store media files e.g. video files still imagery audio files etc. for subsequent playback on display .

Digital media playback receiver may comprise any device configured to render media content received from computer system on remote display . Such devices may include without limitation any sort of portable or non portable general computer system personal digital assistant mobile phone video game system dedicated media player and the like. When assuming the form of a standalone device playback receiver will commonly include software or firmware capable of receiving and decoding media streams and providing corresponding video and or audio output signals to remote display . In many embodiments digital media playback receiver may receive user input via a number of physical input devices e.g. buttons sliders knobs etc. disposed on the housing of playback receiver . Similarly playback receiver may be responsive to user commands received via a remote control as generally illustrated in at .

Controller is also operatively coupled to a network interface which enables packetized data to be sent and received over a communications network e.g. network illustrated in . Digital network interface may include transcoder logic for converting digital media content e.g. video audio data into a packetized format e.g. MPEG QUICKTIME WINDOWS MEDIA and or the like suitable for transmission over digital network . Network interface can operate utilizing any implementation of protocols or other features to support bi directional communication over digital network . In various embodiments network interface supports conventional LAN WAN or other protocols e.g. the TCP IP or UDP IP suite of protocols widely used on the Internet . In such cases network interface can interface with network utilizing any sort of LAN adapter hardware such as a conventional network interface card provided within computer system not shown .

Controller is further operatively coupled to a number of memory elements identified collectively as memory in . Memory will typically include a central processing unit register a number of temporary storage areas and a number of permanent storage areas. Memory can also include one or more mass storage devices such as magnetic hard disk drives optical hard disk drives flash memory drives and the like on which a user may store digital media content for subsequent playback on local display . In certain embodiments memory may include a freestanding mass storage device such as an external hard disc drive coupled to computer system utilizing a universal serial bus cable or other connector cable. As will be readily appreciated selected programs e.g. media player application and or placeshifting application described below can be copied to memory as needed prior to execution by controller to facilitate processing.

As shown in controller can further be operatively coupled to an optical disc drive . Optical disc drive is any device capable of reading a conventionally formatted high density optical disc such as optical disc shown in . In a preferred group of embodiments optical disc drive is compatible with optical discs formatted in accordance with digital versatile disc DVD standards and can access DVD file structures stored thereon. As indicated in optical disc drive can be internal to computer system . Alternatively optical disc drive can comprise a freestanding DVD player or other dedicated media player locally connected to computer system .

During operation controller generally directs the other hardware components of computer system to perform the functions described herein below. In this regard controller can include any suitable number of individual microprocessors microcontrollers digital signal processors programmed arrays and other standard components known in the art. Controller may include or cooperate with any number of software or firmware programs designed to carry out the various methods process tasks calculations and control display functions described herein. In many embodiments controller will execute an operating system during operation of computer system to assist the various programs executing on system to access the hardware features of system . A non exhaustive list of operating systems suitable for use as operating system includes various versions of the WINDOWS operating systems available from the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. UNIX LINUX operating systems available from a number of open source and proprietary sources and the MACOS operating system available from the Apple Corporation of Cupertino Calif. Any number of alternate embodiments based upon other operating systems and computing platforms could also readily be created and utilized as operating system .

Computer system further includes a number of services which provide features that assist in the execution of programs on computer system during operation of operating system . Services may be incorporated into operating system and or into specific drivers associated with the hardware components included within computer system and described above. Services may include abstraction services such as the JAVA or ACTIVE X products available from Sun Microsystems and the Microsoft Corporation respectively.

Computer system furthers include a placeshifting application executable by controller . Placeshifting application is any application that processes user inputs and or media content in any manner to produce the media stream provided to digital media playback receiver . In various embodiments placeshifting application is a conventional software application or applet that resides in memory on computer system and that provides some or all of the various features described herein. In some implementations at least a portion of application is initially executed at system start up and remains in system memory during operation of system to facilitate rapid access to media content . Other embodiments may execute as a plugin or other enhancement to a conventional web browser program or as any other sort of application applet object module and or the like. As will be described more fully below placeshifting application is able to capture encode and transmit a video stream to digital media playback receiver over network . As noted above the video stream may be formatted in accordance with WINDOWS MEDIA QUICKTIME and or MPEG standards although any other standard or proprietary format could be equivalently used. In certain embodiments placeshifting application is configured to encode a portion of a screen display bitmap into a streaming format that can be transmitted on the media as described more fully below in conjunction with . To accomplish these various tasks application suitably interoperates with other applications and features of system using operating system and or services .

Placeshifting application may obtain the media content utilized to produce a media stream in any suitable manner. In various embodiments placeshifting application communicates with a media player application that receives and renders audio visual and or other media content. For example as indicated in at media player application can access video media content obtained from tangible media e.g. DVD read by optical disc drive digital media files stored within memory and or media content delivered over digital network and received via network interface . As will readily be appreciated media player application may be any conventional media player application any sort of plugin or other application associated with any sort of browser program and or the like. In one group of embodiments media play application is a version of the well known WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER program made commercially available from Microsoft Corporation.

After establishing a connection between computer system and digital media playback receiver STEP controller next identifies the media content to be placeshifted STEP . In a preferred group of embodiments controller identifies the media content to be placeshifted based upon user input received via user interface of computer system . As a specific example controller may receive user input data via user interface indicating that content displayed in a particular window is to be placeshifted. Alternatively controller may receive user input designating a portion of a window e.g. a media screen contained within a web browser to be placeshifted e.g. in certain embodiments computer system may enable a user to draw a rectangular or other window on graphical user interface displayed on system to allow the contents of that window to be placeshifted. Drawing the window or otherwise delineating a portion of the display allows the corresponding portion of video memory to be readily identified so that bitmap or other information about the contents of the window can be obtained. In further embodiments the media content to be placeshifted may be automatically identified by controller e.g. if a user is viewing a known webpage controller may be configured to placeshift a portion of that page associated with media imagery without placeshifting the remainder of the window or the display.

Controller of computer system next captures the identified digital media content to be placeshifted STEP . The identified media content can be captured from video memory e.g. VRAM at a frequency sufficient to establish a desired frame rate e.g. 30 frames second or so in one embodiment although other embodiments may utilize any other sampling rate . In various embodiments the frequency at which data is obtained is determined based upon the capacity or capabilities of playback receiver as determined during STEP . As noted above the size and location of the captured region of the video display may be manually or automatically configured in any manner. Moreover the size or location of the captured region may change during the streaming session in response to changes in parameters relating to media content to remote display to network or in the digital media playback receiver . Black or other padding data may be provided if needed to fill in the imagery transmitted and displayed.

Next during STEP the captured digital media content is encoded or otherwise converted into a media stream. In various embodiments raw video frames captured from video memory are converted from a conventional bitmap or similar format to a compressed streaming video format suitable for transmission and or routing on digital network . Such formats can include but are not limited to WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER format QUICKTIME format MPEG format and the like. For example a media encoder module associated with placeshifting application can perform encoding transcoding on the captured frames to create the media stream in the desired format. Compression encryption and or other processing can also be applied. If desired audio data may be captured in addition to video content during STEP . Audio data can be captured by for example creating an audio device driver as part of placeshifting application . Video audio and or any other streams e.g. control streams can then be combined in any manner and transmitted on digital network as desired STEP . In various embodiments the media stream is packetized into a suitable format and transmitted to media catcher over digital network in conventional TCP IP and or UDP IP packets although alternative embodiments may utilize other networking schemes and structures.

Continuing with exemplary placeshifting process illustrated in controller next determines whether media player application is accessing one or more predetermined types of copy protected media content STEP . More specifically during STEP controller may determine whether media player application is accessing a digital media file supported by media player application and containing digital rights management DRM protected content. Additionally or alternatively controller may determine whether media player application is accessing a DVD file structure including copy protected video content. Controller may determine whether the digital content accessed by media player application includes either of these two types of copy protected media in any number of different manners. However by way of non limiting illustration a first exemplary sub process that can be performed during STEP of placeshifting process to determine whether media player application is accessing a digital media file supported by media player application and containing DRM protected content is described below in conjunction with and a second exemplary sub process that can be performed during STEP of placeshifting process to determine whether media player application is accessing a digital media file supported by media player application and containing DRM protected content is described below in conjunction with .

If determining that media player application is not accessing copy protected digital media content during STEP controller returns to STEP and the above described placeshifting process is repeated. In this manner controller continually provides uninterrupted streaming media to digital media playback receiver for playback on remote display if copy protected digital media content is not being accessed. However if media player application is accessing a copy protected digital media content STEP controller advances to STEP and blocks transmission of the media stream and therefore transmission of the copy protected media content. For example controller can halt the transmission of the media stream during STEP . Alternatively controller can obscure transmission of the media stream such that video content is still presented remote display but the rendered video is sufficiently blurred or otherwise modified from conventional viewing standards to deter copying. In still further embodiments wherein controller determines whether media player application is accessing copy protected digital media content prior to commencing streaming of the digital media content e.g. in embodiments wherein STEP is performed before STEP and possibly before STEPS and controller can prevent the transmission of the media stream if it is determined that media player application is accessing copy protected digital media content during STEP . Thus as utilized herein the term blocking is defined broadly to include halting or obscuring the transmission of a media steam if streaming has commenced as well as preventing the transmission of a media stream if streaming has not yet commenced.

In addition to blocking transmission of the media stream controller may cause a visual copy protection alert to be visually expressed on remote display during STEP . The visual copy protection alert generated by controller and rendered on remote display preferably explains that video streaming has been blocked due to the detection of copy protected media currently accessed by media player application . In one embodiment controller transmits a signal to digital media playback receiver to generate on remote display a predetermined visual alert stored in memory. In a second embodiment the content of the visual alert is produced at computer system and then transmitted to digital media playback receiver for presentation on remote display . As a specific example during STEP controller transmit over digital network a bitmap or other image of a text message indicating that video streaming has been blocked due to the detection of currently accessed copy protected media. The text message transmitted over network during STEP can include a message similar to the following PLAYBACK OF COPY PROTECTED CONTENT HAS BEEN PREVENTED. IF DVD IN DRIVE PLEASE REMOVE. If desired a similar visual copy protection alert can also be generated on local display during STEP . STEPS and of process are then repeated in a continual loop until it is determined that media player application is no longer accessing copy protected digital media content e.g. due to the removal of DVD from optical disc drive in which case controller returns to STEP and the placeshifting process is resumed.

In certain embodiments controller may simply search each video object file contained within the DVD file structure to determine whether or not the DVD file structures includes copy protected media content such as MACROVISION protected video content. However even if computer system has relatively robust processing capabilities such a global search of the DVD file structure can place excessive processing and memory demands on computer system . More importantly such a global search will typically require an excessively long time period to be fully carried out and consequently may permit an initial portion of copy protected content to be copied before transmission of the media stream can be blocked. It is therefore desirable for controller to search only a subset of the titles and chapters contained within the DVD file structure to determine whether the DVD file structure contains copy protected media content. It should be noted however that a DVD file structure may include titles that include copy protected content e.g. portions of the feature film as well as titles that do not include copy protected content e.g. previews and trailers . Thus it is typically insufficient for controller to determine whether the DVD file structure contains copy protected media content simply by checking the first title the middle title or any other predetermined title number included within the DVD file structure.

To streamline the search of the DVD file structure and overcome the above noted limitations during STEPS and of sub process controller identifies one or more titles included within the DVD file structure that correspond to the feature film and thus are likely to include any instructions to activate analog copy protection. Referring initially to STEP controller first accesses information files typically having an .ifo extension. Controller then selects one or more titles to be searched for copy protection based upon title duration STEP e.g. controller can select the title having the longest duration which typically includes the feature film or a significant portion thereof. Next controller searches a predetermined number of chapters e.g. the first ten chapters within the longest title to determine whether or not the DVD file structure includes copy protected media STEP . That is during STEP controller can search one or more predetermined sectors of each chapter for instructions to activate an analog copy protection mechanism such as MACROVISION copy protection.

If during STEP controller determines that instruction to activate analog copy protection are detected for at least one chapter in the selected title or titles STEP controller advances to STEP of process blocks transmission of the media stream and generates a copy protected media alert as previously described indicated in at . However if no indication of instruction to activate copy protection are detected during STEP controller returns to STEP of process and the above described placeshifting process continues without interruption indicated in at .

Exemplary sub process and exemplary sub process can be performed for each program currently executed on computer system however it is preferred that sub processes and are performed to analyze only a selected subset of the currently executed programs to improve operational speed and decrease system demands. Thus one or more heuristic techniques can be performed prior to the execution of sub process and or sub process to exclude certain currently executed programs from subsequent evaluation. Further emphasizing this point is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary heuristic technique that can be performed during the exemplary process illustrated in to generate a narrow list of currently executed processes that are potential media player applications currently accessing copy protected digital media content. To commence heuristic technique a wide list of processes currently executed on computer system is compiled STEP by for example taking a snapshot of all processes currently being executed by system . Next steps are performed to narrow the wide list and thus yield a narrow list of currently executed processes that are potential media players. In the illustrated example any known non player processes capable of accessing digital media files are eliminated from the wide list STEP . That is controller can recall from memory a predetermined list of non player processes that can access digital media files such as certain browser applications e.g. WINDOWS EXPLORER . After eliminating from the wide list any known non player processes capable of accessing digital media files STEP controller next determines which processes to select from the wide list based at least in part upon which processes file names include a predetermined alphanumeric grouping. For example as indicated in at STEP controller can select from the wide list all processes that include the letter grouping DVD. Lastly controller determines which processes to select from the wide list based at least in part upon which if any processes are currently utilizing a module supportive of digital media playback. More specifically as indicated in at STEP controller can select all processes currently utilizing a module such as a link library supportive of digital media playback. As a specific example in embodiments wherein media player application is a version of WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER controller can select all processes currently utilizing one of the following digital link libraries Wmvcore.dll utilized to code and render content Quartz.dll a library with functionality for DIRECTSHOW included within DIRECTX and Ddraw.dll utilized in conjunction with DIRECT X to enable multimedia applications to draw 2D graphics . After generating the narrow list STEPS and shown in controller can advance to STEP of process and evaluate each process in the narrow list to determine whether copy protected digital media content is being accessed as described above indicated in at .

The foregoing has thus provided multiple exemplary embodiments of systems methods and program products that enable digital media content to be placeshifted from a computer system to a remotely located television or other display while selectively restricting the placeshifting of copy protected digital media content to deter improper copying. Although described above in conjunction with two particular types of copy protected digital media content i.e. digital media files containing DRM protected content and DVD file structures containing instructions to activate an analog protection mechanism such a MACROVISION protection it is emphasized that embodiments of the systems methods and program products described herein can be utilized to restrict the placeshifting and thus deter the improper copy of various other types of copy protected digital media content.

As utilized herein the word exemplary means serving as an example instance or illustration. Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. While the foregoing Detailed Description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing various embodiments of the invention it should be appreciated that the particular embodiments described above are only examples and are not intended to limit the scope applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. To the contrary various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements described without departing from the scope of the invention.
