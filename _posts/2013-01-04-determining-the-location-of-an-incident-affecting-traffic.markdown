The present invention relates generally to navigation software and more specifically to determining a location of an incident affecting traffic.

The Global Positioning System GPS is used to provide geographic and temporal information via satellite systems that interface with a GPS receiver in order to accurately identify the position of the receiver. To identify the position of the receiver the receiver uses at least four orbiting satellites which continuously transmit pseudo random coded messages that include the time of each transmission as well as the satellite location during each transmission. The receiver collects the transmitted information from the satellites and determines its location based on the information some GPS devices contain multiple receivers in order to connect with more satellites .

Once the location of the GPS receiver has been determined a navigation program coupled with a GPS receiver can generate a travel route to a desired location when equipped with an integrated cartographic database. Integrated cartographic databases allow users to pinpoint a desired location and define it as a destination. Subsequently the navigation program coupled with a GPS receiver can calculate a route based on the location determined via the satellites and the integrated cartographic databases. While traveling to the desired location the receiver maintains contact with the satellites in order to track the route traveled while simultaneously providing a same time map for the user to monitor travel speed and estimated time of arrival.

Aspects of an embodiment of the present invention disclose a method computer program product and system for identifying a location of an incident. A computer receives data from a plurality of navigation devices. The computer determines a portion of a determined route between a first point and a second point of at least one navigation device of the plurality of navigation devices wherein the at least one navigation device deviated from the determined route. The computer determines that two or more portions contain a sub portion. The computer identifies a location of an incident wherein the location is a location of the sub portion.

In one embodiment initially navigation program A provides a user interface to input a destination as well as user preferences. For example a user may prefer a route that bypasses major highways. In one embodiment navigation program A calls the API of the location receiver A in order to receive the initial location of navigation device A. Based on the initial location of navigation device A and individual user preferences navigation program A determines a route to the destination inputted into the program. Navigation program A sends the determined route of navigation device A to incident location deduction program over network . For example a route as determined by navigation program A includes a series of coordinates from the initial location of navigation device A to the final destination and directions for the user to follow as the user travels from the initial location to the destination such as directions for roads to follow turns to make etc. Navigation programs A N function in the same capacity.

As navigation device A deviates from the determined route navigation program A determines an exit point from the determined route. For example the exit point is a coordinate of a point on the determined route at which navigation device A deviates from the determined route. When navigation device A resumes its determined route navigation program A determines the return point. For example a return point is the coordinate of a point on the determined route at which navigation device A resumes travel on the determined route. In one embodiment navigation program A sends the exit and return points of navigation device A to incident location deduction program one at a time as each point is determined.

In one embodiment the portion of the determined route between an exit and return point is a series of coordinates of the determined route.

Incident location deduction program determines if two or more portions contain an overlapping sub portion decision . In one embodiment incident location deduction program compares the portions of the determined route of each of the one or more navigation devices to determine if two or more portions contain the overlapping sub portion. For example incident location deduction program determines if two or more coordinates from two or more potions match. In another embodiment incident location deduction program may determine that two or more portions at least partially overlap.

X may be a numerical value between 0 1 such as 0.3. In one embodiment X is a value preset by a system administrator who also has the ability to adjust the value as necessary. The value can be adjusted after initial trial and error runs of incident location deduction program . Incident location deduction program uses the first threshold to find the sub portion that best represents the section of road which likely contains an incident. Very few navigation devices will leave the determined route and return to the determined route in the exact same place. Using the threshold ensures that the sub portion is not too large or too small and that the sub portion best represents the section of road which likely contains an incident.

If incident location deduction program determines that the ratio of the number of portions that contain the overlapping sub portion divided by a number of portions including the number of portions that contain the overlapping sub portion and a number of portions that only partially overlap the overlapping sub portion exceeds a first threshold decision yes branch incident location deduction program proceeds to step .

Incident location deduction program determines that the number of portions that contain the overlapping sub portion divided by the number of determined routes that contain all the coordinates of the overlapping sub portion is greater than Y.

For example the number of navigation devices that have determined routes that have portions that contain the overlapping sub portion will be divided by the total number of navigation devices that have determined routes that include coordinates that match all the coordinates of the overlapping sub portion. If there are 50 navigation devices that contain the overlapping sub portion divided by a total of 100 navigation devices that have that have determined routes that include coordinates that match all the coordinates of the overlapping sub portion the value of 0.5 is compared to Y which is a numerical value between 0 1 such as 0.3. In one embodiment Y is a value preset by a system administrator who also has the ability to adjust the value as necessary. The value can be adjusted after initial trial and error runs of incident location deduction program . Incident location deduction program uses the second threshold to determine if the number of navigation devices that have deviated from the sub portion of the determined route is significant in comparison with the total number of navigation devices with determined routes that include the sub portion e.g. whether a sufficient proportion of the navigation devices that should have passed through that sub portion actually chose to avoid it .

If incident location deduction program determines that the ratio of the number of navigation devices that contain the overlapping sub portion divided by the number of navigation devices that have determined routes that contain all the coordinates of the overlapping sub portion exceeds the second threshold decision yes branch incident location deduction program proceeds to step .
