With the advent of the information age the volume of documents that have been created stored communicated has grown dramatically while the complexity and variety of different types of documents has experienced equally robust growth. Furthermore documents are often no longer used as unitary elements that are native to their specific formats. Instead a typical use e.g. a presentation often involves using documents of a variety of different formats e.g. portable document file word processor file spreadsheet file slide presentation file portable audio file video file etc. These documents can be gathered together to represent a collection of documents which we call a composite document. The secure creation management use monitoring and disposal of such documents are a significant part of enterprise document lifecycles.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific examples in which the disclosure may be practiced. It is to be understood that other examples may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description therefore is not to be taken in a limiting sense.

At least some examples of the present disclosure at least partially automate workflow at a multifunction printer by guiding a workflow participant through portions of the workflow and or by the multifunction printer acting as a workflow participant to execute some of the actions that might otherwise ordinarily be performed by a human participant. In doing so at least some examples of the present disclosure take advantage of the structure and security of publicly posted composite documents PPCDs by embedding workflow processing instructions into the PPCDs. In one aspect the embedded workflow processing instructions increase compliance and or effectiveness of the human participants in the workflow.

In at least some examples of the present disclosure a composite document comprises a PPCD including a plurality of parts at least one map file for each participant in a workflow associated with the composite document and a set of encryption and signature keys embedded in each corresponding map file. Individual keys are associated with each of the plurality of parts. At least one of the parts of the composite document includes workflow processing instructions or printer processing instructions PPI .

In one aspect the workflow processing instructions are enactable by the multifunction printer to automate at least some tasks that would otherwise be performed by a human participant at the multifunction printer or to guide the human participant through the tasks by employing resident functions of the multifunction printer.

In another aspect access to the workflow processing instructions is limited to assigned credentialed multifunction printer s while access is excluded for other non assigned multifunction printers lacking credentials.

In some examples the full set of all encryption keys provides full access to the PPCD. A subset of the full set of keys provides for a partial access to at least one part the document depending on which key or keys are provided. Each workflow participant is provided with a set or subset of the keys that correspond to the level of access assigned to that particular participant. In one aspect each assigned multifunction printer is also considered to be a workflow participant and therefore is provided with a subset or full set of keys.

At least some examples of the present disclosure dramatically decrease a participant s time spent at a multifunction printer to accomplish their assigned workflow tasks and or dramatically increase the effectiveness of the overall workflow.

In another aspect some types of potential human errors are eliminated while performing tasks at the multifunction printer. Some examples of human errors overcome via at least some examples of the present disclosure include a missing or forgetting to perform some workflow steps such as forgetting to upload a copy of a scanned document to organization s record management system and b mistyping document destination information such as sending a document from a multifunction printer to a wrong destination.

In another aspect via at least some examples of the present disclosure many workflow tasks have been automated and thereby save the user from tedious user input through a device s control panel.

For example many times after a workflow participant prints a document they also send the document via email to another person. In a traditional workflow the participant is expected to affirmatively take several actions to do so. First the participant is expected to remember to email the document to another person to remember the email address and to correctly type the email address into the control panel at the multifunction printer. Even if the email address is conveniently already in a directory accessible via the multifunction printer the participant typically has to make several key strokes to find the desired email address and properly select that email address while avoiding an inadvertent selection of an adjacent email address.

However via at least some examples of the present disclosure many of these actions are already automated via the printer processing instructions that are already embedded within the PPCD. Accordingly upon enactment of the printer processing instructions at the multifunction printer many actions formerly performed by a workflow participant are now performed by the multifunction printer and or made simpler by the multifunction printer.

For example in the case where the workflow indicates that the participant is to send via email a signed document to another individual the printer processing instructions already would have the correct email address for the intended recipient securely embedded into the PPCD to enable the email to be retrieved. Accordingly the participant would be saved from the effort of typing in the intended recipient s email address and there would be no chance of selecting the wrong email address or mistyping the email address and the participant will not need to remember to send the document and thus will not forget to do so.

Moreover upon completion of the participant s tasks the workflow at the multifunction printer would automatically initiate sending the email to the intended recipient thereby avoiding a chance that the participant would forget to do so or intentionally not do so. In addition upon completion of sending the email the multifunction printer can automatically send a notification to others besides the individual in the workflow indicating that the email was sent to the intended recipient such that the system operating the workflow does not have to rely on the individual s memory or willingness to do so.

Because it is known to those establishing the workflow that these actions will be taking place as well as knowing who the participants are where they are located etc. the efficiency and effectiveness of the workflow is greatly enhanced by embedding within the PPCD the printer processing instructions to automatically perform or automatically elicit such actions associated with an individual participants role in the workflow.

It will be understood that the foregoing examples of enhanced workflow via at least some examples of the present disclosure are merely representative of just some of the types of automated workflow produced via printer processing instructions embedded within the PPCD. Rather many other aspects of enhanced workflow occur via at least some examples of the present disclosure some of which are described and or illustrated below.

Accordingly these examples and additional examples are further described and illustrated in association with at least .

In some examples the keyset includes a full set of encryption keys a subset of encryption keys or no encryption keys.

In some examples in the context of a workflow associated with a PPCD differential access is provided among multiple workflow participants and provided for parts of a PPCD via at least the array of map files and encryption keys. In some examples such differential access is implemented via at least some of the features and attributes as the differential access map files and encryption keys for PPCDs as previously described and illustrated in association with Proceeding Doc Eng 10 Proceedings of the 10ACM Symposium on Document Engineering Pages 115 124 ACM New York N.Y. 2010 .

As further shown in at least one of the parts includes printer processing instructions which are enactable by a multifunction printer. The printer processing instructions when enacted by the multifunction printer automate at least some steps of a workflow as represented by workflow automation indicator at the multifunction printer via resident functions of the multifunction printer.

In some examples the multifunction printer enacts the printer processing instructions without the assistance of and or without receiving commands from a server at least because the instructions are provided via the PPCD . Accordingly the multifunction printer enacts the printer processing instructions independent of a server i.e. without a server.

In one aspect access to the printer processing instructions is available to assigned multifunction printers for which credentials are established and access is prevented to the printer processing instructions for non assigned non credentialed multifunction printers. Accordingly the printer processing instructions will not be enactable by those non assigned non credentialed multifunction printers.

In some examples within this framework each PPCD includes a job identifier and a signature to ensure that execution is limited to authorized print jobs.

In general terms the workflow print non eligible part s of the PPCD are not printable at the multifunction printer at least for the particular state in which the PPCD arrives at the multifunction printer and need not have a file format recognizable by the multifunction printer. Accordingly the workflow print non eligible part s are generally unrestricted regarding their file format. Workflow print non eligible parts can be handled on the device as part of a composite document that are intended for printing.

In some examples the print processing instructions comprise a workflow print non eligible part of the PPCD because they will not be printed at the multifunction printer.

In some examples the part of the PPCD that contains printer processing instructions is a text based file and is expressed in a comma separate values CSV file XML or other pre defined format suited to providing printer processing instructions in a manner consistent with at least some examples of the present disclosure in one example the printer processing instructions comprise a string including at least one non executable keyword component as further described later in association with at least in some examples the string takes the form of a metadata structure.

In at least some examples as shown in Table of one workflow participant includes or is defined by a multifunction printer and one part of the PPCD includes or is defined by printer processing instructions PPI enactable by the same multifunction printer . In one aspect such a multifunction printer can be referred to as a MFP workflow participant .

In some examples as expressed in Table a Read Only Access is provided to the MFP workflow participant at least because the printer processing instructions PPI are not changeable by the multifunction printer yet the multifunction printer will access them to be able to enact the printer processing instructions as part of the desired workflow. Details regarding the mechanics of such authentication and or enactment by the MFP workflow participant of the printer processing instructions are further described later in association with at least . Moreover the manner in which the MFP workflow participant generally participates in the work flow also will be further described later in association with at least .

It will be understood that in at least some examples a workflow will include multiple multifunction printers with at least some of those multifunction printers acting as workflow participants. In one aspect the participation of the respective multifunction printers is spaced apart over time and or distance. In some instances the workflow will interleave activity of other workflow participants i.e. humans between and among the MFP workflow participants.

In general terms controller of control portion comprises at least one processor and associated memories that are in communication with memory to generate control signals directing operation of at least some components of the systems and components described throughout the present disclosure. In some examples these generated control signals include but are not limited to automating a workflow at a multifunction printer via printer processing instructions embedded securely within a PPCD . In some examples a control portion is present in the multifunction printer at which the printer processing instructions are enacted and or at which the multifunction printer acts a workflow participant. In some examples a control portion is present in a document management system that establishes and facilitates the PPCD and or its workflow. In some examples a control portion is present in resources that engage or that is engaged by the PPCD along the workflow. Accordingly as the PPCD moves through variety of secure and non secure environments as part of its workflow the PPCD is subject to and or interacts with at least some portions of a control portion .

In particular in response to or based upon commands received via a user interface and or machine readable instructions including software controller generates control signals to at least partially implement the general workflow in accordance with at least some of the previously described examples and or later described examples of the present disclosure. In one example controller is embodied in a general purpose computer while in other examples controller is embodied in other resources associated with the workflow.

For purposes of this application in reference to the controller the term processor shall mean a presently developed or future developed processor or processing resources that executes sequences of machine readable instructions such as but not limited to software contained in a memory. In some examples execution of the sequences of machine readable instructions such as those provided via memory of control portion cause the processor to perform actions as operating controller to generate a PPCD enact printer processing instructions and or provide and operate portions of a workflow as generally described in for consistent with at least some examples of the present disclosure. The machine readable instructions may be loaded in a random access memory RAM for execution by the processor from their stored location in a read only memory ROM a mass storage device or some other persistent storage e.g. non transitory tangible medium or non volatile tangible medium as represented by memory . In one example memory comprises a computer readable tangible medium providing non volatile storage of the machine readable instructions executable by a process of controller . In other examples hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with machine readable instructions including software to implement the functions described. For example controller may be embodied as part of at least one application specific integrated circuit ASIC . In at least some examples the controller is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and machine readable instructions including software nor limited to any particular source for the machine readable instructions executed by the controller .

In some examples user interface comprises a user interface or other display that provides for the simultaneous display activation and or operation of at least some of the various components functions features and of control portion a multifunction printer and or other workflow resources as described throughout the present disclosure. In some examples at least some portions or aspects of the user interface are provided via a graphical user interface GUI .

Moreover it will be understood that the features functions modules and components of the PPCD including the printer processing instructions and associated workflow modalities such as multifunction printer e.g. multifunction printer in as described throughout the disclosure can be arranged in different forms and groupings and therefore the PPCD and various modalities e.g. multifunction printer in are not strictly limited to the particular arrangement or groupings of functions modules and components illustrated in .

With this in mind in some examples composite document generation apparatus generates a PPCD including a plurality of parts with at least a first part including printer processing instructions to at least partially provide for workflow automation for authorized participants at a multifunction printer.

In one aspect the printer processing instructions are enactable via the multifunction printer without the assistance of a server and or without receiving commands from a server thereby providing server less workflow automation at the multifunction printer.

Moreover in some examples to ensure the security of the PPCD at least a portion of the printer processing instructions are non executable by a processor and at least via their association with the encryption keys the printer processing instructions are embedded within and form an inseparable part of the PPCD . In addition via at least these same protections the printer processing instructions cannot be altered or eavesdropped. In one aspect as with other PPCDs part tables and all other tables are also signed to enforce authenticity of the document and those signatures are automatically verified by the multifunction printer according to the standard PPCD access protocol

In some examples the communication module is provided to communicate the PPCD externally of the document management system to enter a workflow which includes but is not limited to enactment of the printer processing instructions at the multifunction printer as further described later in association with at least .

As shown in as part of the workflow W authorized participants interact with the PPCD via modalities adapted to transmit receive store and or manipulate the PPCD with each participant participating to the extent authorized by the document itself. It will be understood that the modalities illustrated in are merely samples and do not represent the full range of modalities by which a PPCD proceeds along workflow W. A PPCD can be accessed on a laptop desktop or other device USB EMAIL LAN and CLOUD can be used as transmission mechanisms. Nevertheless in some examples the modalities shown in include but are not limited to storage interactions e.g. USB devices network interactions e.g. LAN communication interactions e.g. email and cloud based interactions .

As further shown in at some point in the workflow W the PPCD arrives at multifunction printer MFP . In one aspect the PPCD includes printer processing instructions for at least partially automating workflow that are enactable by the multifunction printer to increase compliance and or effectiveness of the human participants in the workflow.

As such the multifunction printer is formally designated as a MFP workflow participant in and therefore is associated with at least one map file and a subset of encryption keys to enable the multifunction printer to interact with parts of a PPCD . Moreover it will be recalled that the printer processing instructions comprise one of the parts of the PPCD and therefore are embedded in the PPCD in an encrypted form as reflected via their presence in Table in .

In one aspect the multifunction printer is itself a workflow participant that performs actions involving or affecting the PPCD in the workflow W with the printer processing instructions addressing but not limited to which actions are to be taken by the multifunction printer and when and how to take those actions and or when where and how the multifunction printer will facilitate a human workflow participant to take specified actions in the workflow.

Accordingly in one aspect as a workflow participant the multifunction printer acts as a resource by which a participant a human or another device can participate in the workflow W at the multifunction printer MFP as dictated by the printer processing instructions embedded in the PPCD .

More specific examples and aspects of the manner in which the printer processing instructions are structured and or dictate the workflow W at the multifunction printer are further described and illustrated in association with at least and at least some of the previously described aspects and examples of the present disclosure.

It will be further understood that while PPCD may include a plurality of embedded printer processing instructions which are defined within a single part or multiple different parts of the PPCD these multiple printer processing instructions all relate to accomplishing the same general workflow W and therefore the multiple printer processing instructions occur in a coordinated fashion whether they are enacted serially in parallel or other pattern.

In some examples as further shown in the string that at least partially defines the printer processing instructions further includes a type component which is further described and illustrated in association with .

In one example a representative structure of one printer processing instruction that includes a type component an action component and a properties component can appear as a string such as on completion upload document record management.hp.com . In one example the string defines a metadata structure within the PPCD .

In one example this printer processing instruction is enactable by the multifunction printer and dictates that upon completion of an earlier action s on completion a TYPE the document will be uploaded upload document an ACTION to a specified destination record management.hp.com a PROPERTY . Finally it will be understand that this example string is merely representative of a wide variety of types actions and properties that can define printer process instructions PPI as part of at least partially automating a workflow in at least some examples of the present disclosure. As a result of such instruction when the participant accomplishes their task at the multifunction printer e.g. prints some document parts and signs out from the device a copy of the document is automatically uploaded by the device into the specified destination record management.hp.com in the above example.

More details regarding the type component action component and properties components of a printer processing instruction are provided in association with at least .

In general terms the type component specifies a context in which a respective one of the printer processing instructions will be accessed via compliance with an access protocol for a PPCD and enacted at or by the multifunction printer. However in some examples a printer processing instruction omits a type component but does include other components such as an action component and a properties component which are further described later in association with at least .

In one example as shown in the type component comprises at least one of a temporal parameter and an event parameter .

As shown in in one example at least a portion of the workflow W includes the event of the PPCD arriving at the multifunction printer ON JOB ARRIVAL event which is specified via the type component of a printer processing instruction . In some examples upon the arrival of the PPCD at the multifunction printer i.e. an event an action component of printer processing instructions dictates that the multifunction printer automatically sends an email to a workflow participant already designated in the printer processing instructions informing them of the job arrival. In one example the email instructs the user to come to the multifunction printer to access the PPCD and participate in the workflow. More comprehensive details regarding the structure and operation of an action component of printer processing instructions are further described later in association with at least .

In one aspect with further reference to when a PPCD arrives event at the multifunction printer before a corresponding action takes place as directed by printer processing instructions some initial handling steps are taken by the multifunction printer . To do so as shown in the multifunction printer in includes an I O PPCD Filter which performs initial handling of the incoming PPCD via sorting the PPCD type files from other types of files.

In some examples this initial handling includes the I O PPCD filter authenticating the PPCD and automatically verifying the printer processing instructions. In some examples the I O PPCD filter also recognizes any time based printer processing instructions which are then decrypted and uploaded to scheduler of multifunction printer in in . In one aspect the PPCD is then stored in a designated directory in the memory of the multifunction printer which is a restricted access directory which in turn is accessible via authentication of the workflow participant at the multifunction printer. The part of the printer processing instructions that are uploaded to scheduler can be removed or otherwise marked as used deployed.

Accordingly after the incoming PPCD is sorted from other incoming jobs and without the parts of the PPCD being engaged directly the multifunction printer stores the PPCD in the memory of the multifunction printer until the stored PPCD is called for as a portion of the remaining workflow W.

Once the incoming PPCD has been properly handled a printer processing instruction including an ON ARRIVAL event is enacted at or by the multifunction printer such as the earlier described example of sending an email to notify a workflow participant that the PPCD has arrived at the multifunction printer. In one aspect the ON ARRIVAL type printer processing instructions are immediately enacted upon the multifunction printer automatically and immediately engaging a PPCD access protocol as will be further described later in association with at least .

With further reference to regarding the type component of the printer processing instructions in some examples a portion of the workflow W includes a participant accessing the PPCD ON USER ACCESS event via a control panel or user interface of the multifunction printer . In some examples the user is present at the user interface because the user was previously prompted via email see ON JOB ARRIVAL event of the presence of the PPCD at the multifunction printer and therefore the user has approached the user interface to participate in the workflow.

On the other hand one example of the ON USER ACCESS event includes a participant loading the PPCD into the memory of the multifunction printer via a USB memory device.

In either case before a participant can perform workflow tasks involving the PPCD the human participant as a requester will engage a PPCD access protocol at user interface of multifunction printer as shown in .

As shown in the PPCD access protocol initiates an authentication that challenges the requester to supply credentials such as username and password as part of a login . In one aspect this authentication is supported by or involves a LDAP server. In some examples authentication is omitted from the protocol.

If the requester is successfully authenticated the requester s private keys are fetched as represented at . In some examples access keys are accessed from a portable memory resource such as a smart card USB memory device or local in device key store.

In the case where the requester is a human participant a status is reported to the user via a pop up notification at the user interface regarding whether their private keys have been successfully retrieved and whether such keys will successfully access the part s of the PPCD .

If the requester s keys are correct then access is granted to parts of PPCD to which the requester whether human or MFP has been assigned keys Table in . However if the requester s keys are incorrect then access is denied to the parts of PPCD .

For human requesters a status of allowed or denied access is reported via a pop up notification at the user interface in . In some examples the status regarding allowed or denied access also is communicated e.g. via email to others e.g. supervisor colleague etc. to inform them of an attempted but denied access or an attempted successful access. Besides helping to manage a workflow such status reports enhance security of the PPCD .

A process of a multifunction printer as a requester accessing a part in the PPCD also follows generally the same steps authentication key retrieval and access as for a human requester except that with the multifunction printer as a requester the initial authentication is performed automatically and directly between the multifunction printer and the PPCD . As noted above in some examples authentication is omitted. 

On the other hand when a human requester engages the PPCD access protocol at least some manual steps would be performed at the user interface of multifunction printer in such as entering a login name and entering a password.

Accordingly except for some level of automation when the multifunction printer attempts access the manner in which a human requester or a multifunction printer as a requester engages the initial portion of the PPCD access protocol is generally the same.

As further shown in a query at signals a transition to potential enactment of printer processing instructions. In particular the case in which the decrypted accessed part of the PPCD is not a printer processing instruction PPI corresponds to a workflow for a human participant. As shown at in the user can print the document at the multifunction printer or take other available actions e.g. digital send according to whatever instructions the user already had in possession about their role in the workflow.

On the other hand as represented at in in the case where the decrypted accessible part of the PPCD is a printer processing instruction PPI then the multifunction printer automatically enacts the printer processing instruction s .

Having set forth some of the mechanics of securely accessing printer processing instructions before enacting the printer processing instructions additional examples are provided regarding the features and attributes of the ON ACCESS event of type component of a printer processing instruction.

In some examples the action component of the particular printer processing instructions call for the multifunction printer to communicate to the human workflow participant which workflow tasks to perform. In one example the PPCD includes placeholders for insertion of documents to be scanned by the workflow participant. Accordingly via the ON USER ACCESS event upon the user accessing the PPCD one action includes prompting at the user interface in or via email notification the participant to obtain or supply a document and then scan that document at the multifunction printer. For example if the workflow involved financial matters such as a mortgage application the pop up notification would instruct the user retrieve a copy of their W2 yearly income record and scan that W2 record which then automatically becomes a part of the PPCD . In other words the PPCD automatically directs the multifunction printer to integrate the scanned document into the PPCD at the placeholder.

In one example the workflow is further automated by instructing the user to authorize the MFP to append a digital signature available from the memory of the MFP to the PPCD . This action avoids traditional cumbersome process of the user printing a document physically signing it and the scanning the document.

In some examples the multifunction printer will be notified anytime that a signature is called for on a document from a part of the PPCD so that the multifunction printer can automatically add the users digital signature to the PPCD after timely engagement with the PPCD access protocol.

In one example via the ON ACCESS event in the printer processing instructions upon the user accessing the PPCD user interface causes a pop up notification displaying a listing of the parts or subparts of PPCD for which the user can initiate an action at the multifunction printer such as requesting printing.

As a general matter and also applicable specifically regarding an ON ACCESS event associated with a printer processing instruction full decryption does not take place until just before the specified action will be taking place. This timing helps to maintain security over the printer processing instructions and or the contents of the PPCD itself and part of the PPCD being handled at or by the multifunction printer at that time.

In one example with further reference to an ON COMPLETION event occurs upon a participant meeting a workflow milestone established by the printer processing instructions. For example the milestone could be completion of all requested actions for a particular participant or for that multifunction printer when it acts as a workflow participant . For example a few representative sample milestones could include a participant scanning all requested documents adding all requested electronic signatures and or sending the updated PPCD to a particular addressee. Additional examples of actions associated with an ON COMPLETION type event are further described later in association with at least .

In particular as shown in in one example at least a portion of the workflow W is automatically executed or triggered based on an absolute time factor ABSOLUTE factor such as but not limited to a time of day day of the week time and date etc. In some examples this ABSOLUTE factor exhibits a repeating behavior such as a time day occurring each week which is represented by the indicator INTERVAL. In some examples the ABSOLUTE factor occurs a single time for a given PPCD or for a given multifunction printer.

Accordingly when the particular temporal occasion occurs per ABSOLUTE factor the printer processing instructions will commence an action to be performed automatically by the multifunction printer or an action in which the multifunction printer guides or instructs a user to perform a workflow task. In some examples such guidance or instruction takes the form of an email pop up notification at a user interface of the multifunction printer etc.

As further shown in in some examples at least a part of the workflow W is automatically executed or triggered based on a relative time factor RELATIVE factor of temporal parameter of type component of a printer processing instruction. In some examples the RELATIVE time factor includes a time period preceding coinciding with or following an event E or an absolute time factor ATF . In one example as shown in a printer processing instruction specifying a RELATIVE factor for a temporal parameter of the type component of a printer processing instruction is executed or triggered upon an elapsed time period ELAPSED TIME following an event.

In some examples aspects of the event parameter and the temporal parameter of the type component of a printer processing instruction are combined or cooperate along generally the same portion of a workflow W or different portions of a workflow W.

In one example the temporal parameter of the type component of a printer processing instruction leverages the operation of the scheduler of the multifunction printer. In some examples to facilitate a user performing a task that is part of the workflow such as scanning a document possessed by the user the printer processing instruction includes the action of sending an email to the user every fifteen minutes until unless the user performs the requested workflow task. In this situation the temporal parameter of the type component of a printer processing instruction causes the multifunction printer to automatically perform actions to facilitate the work flow such as tracking the time intervals via a scheduler of the multifunction printer to perform the action of monitoring the status of whether another action e.g. scanning a document was performed or not. In another aspect this example illustrates how one of the resident functions e.g. scheduler of the multifunction printer is leveraged to deploy printer processing instructions.

In some examples upon entry of the PPCD to the multifunction printer at the I O PPCD filter and in coordination with scheduler each printer processing instruction is time stamped with its time of arrival. Via the temporal parameter of type component one of the printer processing instructions can specify an action that the multifunction printer notifies a workflow participant via email or pop up notification within a certain time period ELAPSED time from the time of arrival of the PPCD . In some examples the temporal parameter of type component also can be employed to specify an event as an elapsed time after an action i.e. workflow task performed by the workflow participant.

The examples described and illustrated in association with Figure are merely representative of a wide variety of ways to employ the temporal parameter and or event parameter of a type component of a printer processing instruction in accordance with at least some examples of the present disclosure.

In some examples a family of printer processing instructions include a closed library of a fixed number of keywords which provides one aspect of security as each action will have a corresponding unique keyword and actors outside of workflow W will not have knowledge of those keywords. However in some examples some of the keywords include additional unnecessary characters or symbols to obscure the content of the keyword.

In some examples keywords for an action component include keywords such as upload store send sign etc. In one aspect a limited vocabulary e.g. fixed set of keywords is employed. In some examples each keyword is related to a workflow task and or resident function of the multifunction printer.

In some examples the keyword is non executable to ensure security of the action component and the printer processing instruction as a whole. Moreover the keyword is further secured via being a portion of the embedded encrypted printer processing instructions PPI .

In some examples the action component forms part of a printer processing instruction without a specified type component . In some examples the action component specifies an action in relation to or in response to a specified type per type component .

As further shown in the action component includes an array of application programming interfaces API . In one aspect at least some of the respective application programming interfaces correspond to or define at least some of the resident functions of the multifunction printer. In some examples at least some of the application programming interfaces include but are not limited to a transmit API a storage API a user interface API end or a job processing API .

In general terms the transmit receive API includes but is not limited to functions which transmit or receive part of a PPCD or subparts of a document or other information. Accordingly in some examples the transmit receive API includes functions or actions such as facsimile communications email directly to from the multifunction printer data upload etc.

In general terms the storage API includes but is not limited to functions or actions which relate to storage of parts or subparts of a PPCD. In some examples the storage API tracks and or controls storage to disk storage to a USB memory device retrieval from memory etc.

In general terms the user interface API includes but is not limited to functions or actions which relate to the user interface s of the multifunction printer. Accordingly in some examples the user interface API includes such functions or actions such as pop up notifications of a control panel that request further information indicate a status confirm completion of an action etc.

In general terms the job processing API includes but is not limited to functions or actions which relate to the job processing performed on some parts of the PPCD by the multifunction printer. Accordingly in some examples the job processing API includes such functions or actions such as printing documents scanning documents appending or authorizing a digital signature for a part or the whole PPCD etc.

In one example of the present disclosure the at least partially automated workflow at the multifunction printer includes the action of applying a digital signature to a part of a PPCD . In this way by incorporating the digital signature into the PPCD a great deal of time and effort is saved as compared to traditional methods of obtaining signatures. In a traditional workflow to obtain a signature the participant would print a part of document e.g. word processing document physically sign it with ink and then scan the physically signed document. Sometimes further additional steps of navigating directories and other commands follow the actual scanning.

However via at least some examples of the present disclosure the job processing API enables directly applying a previously obtained digital signature stored at the multifunction printer to parts of the PPCD . This action saves numerous workflow steps because the document part need not be printed need not be physically signed and or need not be scanned to become incorporated into the PPCD . Rather in at least some examples the printer processing instructions automate the workflow via directly and automatically retrieving the digital signature at the multifunction printer and apply it appropriately to the PPCD . Alternatively the workflow is at least partially automated by sending a notification to a participant to apply the digital signature to the PPCD at the multifunction printer.

In some examples in a manner consistent with at least the description associated with the method is stored as machine readable instructions within a non transitory computer readable medium and that are generally executable by or on a processor of a multifunction printer.

In some examples at method includes providing a publicly posted composite document PPCD that includes a plurality of parts at least one map file for each participant in a workflow associated with the publicly posted composite document and a set of encryption keys associated with each one of the plurality of parts and distributed via the map file to the participants. In some examples the set includes at least one of an encryption key a decryption key a signature key and a verification key.

At method includes receiving the publicly posted composite document PPCD at the multifunction printer and enacting the printer processing instructions via at least one application programming interface of the multifunction printer to automate at least some steps of the workflow at the multifunction printer.

At least some examples of the present disclosure at least partially automate workflow at a multifunction printer by guiding a workflow participant through portions of the workflow and or by the multifunction printer acting as a workflow participant to execute some of the actions that might otherwise ordinarily be performed by a human participant. In doing so at least some examples of the present disclosure take advantage of the structure and security of publicly posted composite documents PPCDs by embedding workflow processing instructions into the PPCDs.

At least some examples of the present disclosure dramatically decrease a participant s time spent at a multifunction printer to accomplish their assigned workflow tasks and or dramatically increase the effectiveness of the overall workflow.

Although specific examples have been illustrated and described herein a variety of alternate and or equivalent implementations may be substituted for the specific examples shown and described without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the specific examples discussed herein.
