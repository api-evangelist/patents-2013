This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 781 461 entitled Optimization of the Presence Information Refresh for a Wireless Device filed May 17 2010 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention generally relates to wireless telecommunication systems. More particularly the present invention relates to techniques for optimizing presence information refresh rates for wireless devices that utilize a wireless telecommunication network.

Presence information is one of the most important enabling data for mobile device multimedia services. In order to enable mobile instant messaging group chat media sharing and other forms of communication the mobile device user needs to have the presence information of his or her contacts and know the capabilities of his or her contact s mobile devices. There exist several different standardized methods for providing up to date presence information to a mobile device. However the cost of updating presence information over commercial wireless network is quite significant in terms of over the air resources needed for request and transmission of this data. The overhead needed in the wireless telecommunication network is thus much higher than using a fixed network.

Given the high overhead requirements for presence information on a wireless communication network techniques for optimizing the timing and conditions associated with a presence information update request are desirable. It is thus to such techniques that the present disclosure is primarily directed.

The various embodiments may include a method of updating presence information on a mobile device by calculating an update quantification based at least on one of a network setting priority information associated with an application requesting presence information a timestamp of presence information stored in the memory a user priority how the mobile device is being used an access policy for an access network information identifying bandwidth of a wireless channel a time period between subsequent requests for presence information and load information for a base transceiver station comparing the update quantification to a threshold value determining whether presence information for a second mobile device stored in a memory of the mobile device requires updating based at least in part on the comparison of the update quantification to the threshold value selecting one channel from a plurality of available communication channels in response to determining that the presence information for the second mobile device stored in memory requires updating wherein each communication channel of the plurality of available communication channels is associated with a different communication protocol and updating the presence information for the second mobile device stored in the memory of the mobile device via the selected one channel.

Further embodiments may include a method of updating presence information on a mobile device by calculating an update quantification comparing the update quantification to a threshold value determining whether presence information for a second mobile device stored in a memory of the mobile device requires updating based at least in part on the comparison of the update quantification to the threshold value selecting one channel from a plurality of available communication channels in response to determining that the presence information for the second mobile device stored in memory requires updating wherein each communication channel of the plurality of available communication channels is associated with a different communication protocol and updating the presence information for the second mobile device stored in the memory of the mobile device via the selected one channel. In an embodiment selecting one channel from a plurality of available communication channels may include calculating data rate information for each of the plurality of available communication channels generating scores for each of the plurality of available communication channels based on the data rate information and selecting the one channel in the plurality of available communication channels based on the generated scores.

Further embodiments may include a method of updating presence information on a mobile device by calculating an update quantification comparing the update quantification to a threshold value determining whether presence information for a second mobile device stored in a memory of the mobile device requires updating based at least in part on the comparison of the update quantification to the threshold value returning cached presence information in response to determining that the presence information for the second mobile device stored in the memory does not require updating selecting one channel from a plurality of available communication channels in response to determining that the presence information for the second mobile device stored in memory requires updating wherein each communication channel of the plurality of available communication channels is associated with a different communication protocol and updating the presence information for the second mobile device stored in the memory of the mobile device via the selected one channel.

The NIC which may be internal or external can be connected to the system bus. In a networked environment program modules depicted relative to the computer system or portions thereof may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections described here are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used. Moreover while it is envisioned that numerous embodiments of the present disclosure are particularly well suited for computerized systems nothing in this document is intended to limit the disclosure to such embodiments.

Referring now to it illustrates a mobile device including a display . The mobile device can include a computer platform that can handle voice and data packets execute software applications and transmit information across a wireless network. The computer platform includes among other components at least one processor such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or a RISC processor such as those that implement the ARM architecture. The processor is installed at the time of manufacture of the wireless communication device and is not normally upgradeable. The processor can execute an application programming interface API layer which can include an operating system which can control the hardware of the mobile device. An example of an operating system is the binary runtime environment for wireless BREW software developed by QUALCOMM for wireless communication device platforms.

As shown here the mobile device can be a wireless communication telephone but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform as known in the art such as a personal digital assistant PDA a pager with a graphics display or even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Memory i.e. non transitory computer readable storage media can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EPROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform can also include a local database for storage of software applications not actively in memory . The local database is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EPROM EEPROM optical media tape or soft or hard disk.

The computer platform can also include a communication interface that can be used to open a data channel to an endpoint such as a media server. The communication interface can also be part of the standard communication interface for the mobile device which ordinarily carries the voice and data transmitted to and from the wireless communication device . The communication interface typically is comprised of hardware that is known in the art.

Continuing with the description of additionally depicted is a diagram of software layers of that can execute on the processor . In an embodiment computer platform can include a series of software layers developed on top of the Mobile Station Modem MSM and the Advanced Mobile Subscriber Software AMSS developed by QUALCOMM . In this example the underlying MSM chipset can implement the software protocol stack for the entire suite of CDMA communication technologies that include CDMA2000 1X and CDMA2000 1xEV DO. In this example the AMSS can be configured to support a mobile operating system layer which in an embodiment is BREW . The mobile operating system layer can provide an application programming interface for chip or device specific operations while providing an isolation layer that eliminates direct contact to the AMSS and any OEM software on the mobile device . The mobile operating system layer can enable application development that uses wireless communication device features without having to rewrite the application each time a new release of the device specific software is released.

In this example the mobile operating system is shown including presence module . Presence module is shown in dashed lines which indicates that it is considered optionally located within the operating system and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated embodiment.

Continuing with the description of it also shows that operating system can support the execution of one or more applications such as media clients e.g. content players instant messenger programs push to talk applications map applications or any other application that uses presence information.

Turning to an exemplary wireless network is illustrated. The wireless network is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components of a wireless network including without limitation wireless network carriers and or servers. As one of skill in the art can appreciate each element can be effectuated by one or more computer systems including elements such as those described above with respect to . As illustrated by the figure mobile device while one mobile device is shown one skilled in the art can appreciate that many more can simultaneously use the wireless network can be in wireless communication with an access network which can include base transceiver station and base station controller . Access network includes the equipment that provides data connectivity between a packet switched data network and mobile devices over an air interface such as for example 1X EV DO or the High rate packet data HRPD air interface.

For example an HRPD system is like a CDMA system and uses spread spectrum and interference averaging to allow frequency reuse within a cell. In the forward link all physical channels are time multiplexed on a single composite channel whereas in the reverse link physical channels are code multiplexed and grouped as those used in the access mode or traffic channel mode. Reverse traffic channel mode includes a data channel which is used to carry user traffic from the mobile device to the base transceiver station.

Continuing with the description of an access node authentication authorization and accounting server AAA used to authenticate mobile devices can be coupled to a database operable to store information such as user accounts and privileges.

Data packets can be routed from the access network to the packet data servicing node PDSN via a packet controlled function PCF . PCF is an element e.g. one or more computer systems that controls the transmission of packets between the access network and the PDSN . The PCF can be configured to keep track of registration and sessions control available radio resources buffer data received from the PDSN until radio resources are available etc. PDSN includes equipment configured to provide data connectivity between a radio access network and a packet switched data network such as the Internet. Coupled to the packet switched data network is are presence server s which is are configured to store presence information for a plurality of applications.

Presence information can include status indicators that convey the ability and willingness of a potential communication partner location information device capabilities and the like. Common status indicators that indicate a user s willingness to communicate are free for chat busy away do not disturb and out to lunch. Information that conveys the ability of the user to communicate can indicate whether the user is online or offline. In exemplary embodiments device capabilities could include whether the device includes a push to talk application can handle text messages can handle streaming media includes a camera includes a music player application or whether the user s service plan enables certain features.

Presence aware applications can obtain presence information from presence servers . For example a presence aware application can be affiliated with one or more servers that store its presence information in a presence record called a presentity. The presentity can be made available for distribution to other users to convey his or her presence information to compatible applications. A specific example could include a presence server that stores a user s online offline status for a push to talk application. The presence server can make this online offline status information available to other devices that run a compatible push to talk application. In this example presence module on a device could receive a request from a push to talk application for status information and presence module can determine how to optimize use of the access network by for example determining whether to use a different access method to obtain presence information delay the request until network conditions are favorable and or respond with cached presence information.

Voice packets can be routed to a mobile switching center MSC . The MSC is the primary service delivery node responsible for handling voice calls and SMS as well as other services such as conference calls FAX and circuit switched data . Connected to the MSC is a home location register HLR and the public switched telephone network PSTN . The HLR is the location register to which a user identity is assigned for record purposes such as subscriber information. The HLR is the first database that is interrogated to obtain mobile location and routing information once a mobile device s number is dialed by a user outside the network.

Turning now to it shows mobile device including presence module . As illustrated by the figure presence module is shown as a single point of contact on mobile device for presence requests from presence aware applications and . For example an application program interface can be made available to presence aware applications. In an exemplary embodiment a presence aware application can register with presence module and indicate to presence module what type of presence information it is interested in e.g. location information device state information or application specific presence information. Presence module can then configure one or more stores e.g. memory in a cache of memory to store received presence information. In an exemplary embodiment presence module can store information that multiple applications use in a common store and store application specific information in an application specific store. For example presence module can cache location information once in a common store and store for example status information for buddies in an application specific store.

Presence module can optimize the presence information update requests by reducing the amount of access network resources while taking application performance into account. As shown by the figure presence module can use different communication channels effectuated by different access technologies to obtain presence information from presence servers . For example shows four different access methods that can be used to access packet switched data network through a communication port or a wireless transceiver . Communication port can be a port that connects mobile device to packet switched data network either directly or via a physical bridge. For example communication port can include an Ethernet port that connects mobile device to packet switched data network directly or it can be a USB port that is used to physically connect mobile device to a router or computer that is directly or indirectly connected to packet switched data network .

As shown by the figure wireless transceiver is indicated in dashed lines which indicate that it can be a single component or multiple components that implement multiple wireless technologies. For example in an embodiment wireless transceiver can communicate with a device via a communication channel that conforms to the 802.15 communication standard such as a Bluetooth device. In the same or another embodiment wireless transceiver can communicate with a device via a communication channel that conforms to the 802.11 communication standard such as a Wi Fi device. In the same or another embodiment wireless transceiver can communicate with access network using a communication channel that conforms to the HRPD standard.

Presence engine can be configured to attempt to update presence information via these other communication channels or open traffic channels in an exemplary embodiment. Thus in this exemplary embodiment additional access network resources would not have to be used to update the presence information. For example presence engine can be configured to use an algorithm that uses channel performance information values assigned by the access technology and open channels to select a channel to update over.

For example mobile device can detect available access technologies and store a list of them in memory. Presence engine can look up the access technologies obtain preference values for them that can be assigned by an access network admin and adjust the values based on whether a channel of that type is already open. Or put another way a preference can be given to channels that are already open and being used to send receive information. Presence engine can then calculate or use a lookup table to obtain data rate information. After data rate information is quantified and associated with values presence engine can then generate scores for each available communication channel and select the best one. Presence engine can then send the request using the selected access technology.

In some exemplary embodiments presence engine can be configured to determine whether to use a channel to update presence information or return cached information instead. For example presence engine can be configured to perform this operation after a channel is selected before a channel is selected or without selecting a channel in this last case presence engine may be configured to only use a reverse traffic channel for updates . Presence engine can determine whether or not to update presence information using an algorithm that uses various information stored in memory as inputs and calculates a quantification. In this exemplary embodiment the presence engine can then compare the quantification to a threshold and determine whether or not to update the presence information.

In an exemplary embodiment presence engine can be configured to determine whether to update presence information from information associated one or more timestamps associated with cached presence information. For example in an embodiment where timestamps are used presence engine can compare the current timestamp to a timestamp associated with the requested type of presence information. Presence engine can then use an algorithm that takes this information into account and generate a quantification. The quantification can then be compared to a threshold to determine whether or not the presence information should be updated.

In the same or another exemplary embodiment priority information associated with an application requesting the presence information can be used to generate the quantification. For example each application can be associated with priority information that indicates the importance of the application. In a specific example an E 911 application that sends location information to emergency personal can have a higher priority than other applications. In this exemplary embodiment presence engine can identify the requesting application and lookup a priority score for the application. Presence engine can then use an algorithm that takes this information into account and generate a quantification. The quantification can then be compared to a threshold to determine whether or not the presence information should be updated.

In the same or another exemplary embodiment user profile information can be used to generate the quantification. For example each mobile device can be associated with a user account that has a score based on the importance of the user. In a specific example an emergency personnel user can have a higher priority score than a regular user. In another specific example a user that pays a fee for premium service can have a higher priority score than a regular user. In this exemplary embodiment presence engine can obtain the score associated with the user account and execute an algorithm that takes this information into account and generate a quantification. The quantification can then be compared to a threshold to determine whether or not the presence information should be updated.

In the same or another exemplary embodiment how the device is being used can be used to generate the quantification. For example information that identifies whether a user is actively interacting with mobile device can be used to affect the quantification. In this example if mobile device is being used it may be more likely that the presence information is updated in order to influence the user s experience using the mobile device .

In the same or another exemplary embodiment current access network conditions can be used to determine the quantification. For example each access network e.g. each base transceiver station can measure current network conditions and send information to the mobile devices it services to indicate for example the load on the base transceiver current interference levels available bandwidth etc. For example the forward link channel can include a medium access control channel that has load information such the number of channels in use the level of activity in sector e.g. interference level etc. This information can be mapped to a table that quantifies the possible values and the information can be used by presence engine to calculate the quantification. The quantification can then be compared to a threshold to determine whether or not the presence information should be updated.

In an alternative embodiment the threshold can be set based on the current access network conditions instead of or in addition to the quantification. Similar to that described above current network conditions can be measured and sent to the mobile devices it services to indicate for example the load on the base transceiver. For example presence engine can be configured to receive information that defines the load on the base transceiver station . This information can be mapped to a table that quantifies the possible values and the information can be used by presence engine to calculate the threshold.

Continuing with the description of in an embodiment of the present disclosure presence module can be configured to delay deny or immediately send presence information requests based on information such as user settings device settings access network settings device state user profile settings and the like. For example a user may set settings that indicate whether or not an application can request presence information. In the same or another embodiment where a user initiated update is received e.g. a user pressed a refresh button the presence module can send the request without running the presence engine . In the same or another embodiment a network policy can be received that identifies whether presence information updates should be triaged. For example a base transceiver station could broadcast information that can be used to configure the presence module to disable the presence engine in a zone that has a light load.

The following are a series of flowcharts depicting operational procedures. Those having skill in the art can appreciate that the style of presentation utilized herein e.g. beginning with a presentation of a flowcharts presenting an overall view and thereafter providing additions to and or further details in subsequent flowcharts generally allows for a rapid and easy understanding of the various operational procedures. Furthermore those of skill in the art that certain operations can be executed in a different order than described herein thus the disclosure is not limited to any specific order of operations.

Turning now to an exemplary operational procedure for practicing aspects of the present disclosure is shown. Operation begins the operational procedure when for example an application such as a map application accesses an API and requests preference information e.g. location information for the mobile device . For example the application could request presence information in response to receiving a request from a user or the application could be configured to periodically request presence information. Alternatively operation could begin in response to a delay operation. For example presence module may have received a request measured access network information and determined to wait for network conditions to become more favorable before requesting data. Thus the request could be cached and presence module could run the operational procedure of after a predetermined amount of time.

Continuing with the description at decision presence module can be configured to determine if features of the presence module have been enabled. In one embodiment if a reverse traffic channel is permitted to send presence information then the method will proceed to step to update the presence information via reverse traffic channel and then store the updated presence information in memory as shown at step and then the presence information will be sent to the calling resident application as shown at step .

Alternately a settings override can be set to send the presence information only on non access network based channels and the process will proceed to step . Then the non access network based channel will be selected and the presence information will be updated via that channel as shown by step . The updated presence information will then be stored in memory as shown at step and then the presence information will be sent to the calling resident application as shown at step .

In another embodiment if settings do not support the immediate requesting of presence information through the use of a channel then the presence information can be sent from memory to the requesting resident application as shown at step . Otherwise if no specific settings override exists at decision then the presence module can detect all available communication channels to send the presence information as shown at step . Other settings for communication channel transmission can likewise be set for the presence module as needed.

To originally obtain any settings information presence module can access a data structure in memory that can store information indicative of specific device settings e.g. network and or user profile settings. In an embodiment this information can be used to configure presence information updates. For example the data structure could store information that configures presence module to enable disable updates via access network . In another example the data structure could store information that configures presence module to disable access network updates and presence module can be configured to select a non access network communication channel to update presence information if one is present as is shown at step . In another exemplary embodiment the data structure in memory can store network settings or user profile settings which can indicate that the user s account does or does not authorize the user to automatically obtain a data channel to receive presence information updates. In this example the user would have to instead have his or her request processed by presence engine .

As shown by if overrides authorize direct presence information updates then presence module can send one or more packets of information indicative of the presence information update on a reverse traffic channel to base station transceiver . With reference to the request can be routed to the PDSN and one or more TCP IP packets can be routed to the presence server that stores the requested presence information. For example the request could be for the online offline status of friends in a contacts list. The updated presence information online offline status can be routed back to mobile device and stored in presence information cache in memory as shown by operation . Operation shows that presence module can be configured to return presence information stored in cache to the requesting application. In this example the returned presence information would include the updated online offline status of friends in contact list.

As illustrated by if an override configures presence module to provide cached information then as illustrated by the path directly to operation presence module can return presence information stored in memory to the requesting application. Continuing with the example from above since the online offline status of friends was not updated then the information may not reflect the current situation.

As illustrated by operation in an embodiment of the present disclosure presence engine can detect the available communications channels. For example presence engine can survey a site and identify available wireless networks Bluetooth devices HRPD channels etc. Based on the site survey presence engine can determine at operation whether or not a new reverse traffic channel will need to be opened with base transceiver station in order to service the request. For example the site survey may indicate that no other channels are available or presence engine may determine that the best communication channel is provided by access network . Turning to operation if a new reverse traffic channel is not needed the update request can be sent via a selected communication channel e.g. if a reverse channel is opened the request can be sent via that channel or if a 802.11 channel is available it can be sent via that channel etc.

Turning to operation in an embodiment where a new reverse traffic channel is selected at decision presence engine can determine whether to return cached information or use access network to obtain updated presence information. Turning to operation a quantification can be determined from various information e.g. network conditions timestamps etc. and the quantification can be compared to a threshold. Presence engine can either update presence information operation or returned cached information operation based on the comparison operation .

Turning now to there is shown an operational procedure for practicing aspects of the present disclosure. illustrates an embodiment where presence module is configured to check to see if requested presence information is old before determining whether to update the information. Operation begins when presence module receives a request from an application for presence information e.g. location information. Presence module can run and determine what information the application is requesting and presence information cache for the presence information. In this exemplary embodiment multiple applications may use the requested presence information and the presence module may have previously obtained the information within a short period of time. Thus as illustrated by operation presence module can be configured to check to determine whether it has the desired information before determining whether to update the information.

As shown by operation if presence module detects the desired presence information it can determine whether the information has been stored in cache for a length of time greater than a predetermined threshold. Predetermined threshold could be a value that is set in accordance with access network information a user profile and or the priority associated with the requesting application. For example a user profile that indicates that the user is a priority user could have an associated threshold that is lower than a regular user. Similarly when access network is stressed a message can be sent to mobile device setting the threshold to a larger value.

Continuing with the description of operation presence module can execute and compare a timestamp for the presence information to the current time and calculate a difference. Presence module can then compare the difference to the threshold and determine whether the presence information is stale. As shown by the figure if the information is stale presence engine can run otherwise presence module can return the cached presence information to the application as shown by operation . Similar to that described above when presence information is stale presence engine can execute and generate a quantification operation . The quantification can be compared to a threshold and a determination at can be made as to whether access network resources should be used to update the presence information. In an alternative embodiment instead of generating quantification at operation presence engine can execute the portion of the operational procedure of that detects available communication channels and determines whether a new reverse traffic channel needs to be opened. The operational procedure could then branch back to operation .

Operation shows that presence module can determine to update the presence information by determining which server to send a request to from for example information that registers a networked location for the desired presence information and sending a request on a reverse traffic channel to base transceiver station of . Updated presence information can be received and sent to the application at . In the instance that presence engine determines not to update the information and state information is not in memory operation No the request can fail at . For example a message can be displayed to the user indicating that presence information could not be obtained at this time presence module can run through the algorithm again after a predetermined amount of time expires or the presence module can attempt to obtain the presence information via a different communication channel e.g. Bluetooth Wi Fi etc. similar to that described above with respect to . Continuing with the description if old presence information is available operation Yes it can be sent to the application operation . In an alternative embodiment a message can be displayed indicating that the information is old. In the same or an alternative embodiment instead of returning stale presence information presence module can attempt to obtain the presence information via a different communication channel similar to that described above with respect to .

Turning to it illustrates an operational procedure for practicing aspects of the present disclosure. illustrates an embodiment where presence module has determined to select a communication channel from a group and send the request via that channel. For example presence module can be configured to execute some or all of the operations illustrated in in response to receiving a request for presence information from an application or after some or all of the operations illustrated in and or are executed.

Operation begins the operational procedure when for example an application requests presence information e.g. status information for contacts in an address book application. For example a user could open a push to talk application and the application could request status information e.g. information which indicates whether a remote user is busy available etc. for the users in the address book. In response to the request and as illustrated by operation status information for available communication channels can be obtained. For example presence engine can access a data structure in memory that identifies the different available communication channels. Once the data structure is accessed a score can be computed for each available communication channel using an algorithm that factors in at least a preference rating.

A channel can be selected operation and a request for updated presence information can be sent to a server. Continuing with the push to talk example the push to talk application could have previously registered with presence module and could identify the type of information it uses and a networked server that stores the information. In this example presence module can send a request in the format used to make such requests i.e. a request that conforms to the protocol used by the presence server to the presence server via the selected channel and store the updated presence information e.g. status information for push to talk contacts operation . Operation then shows that the updated presence information can be sent to the requesting application.

Turning to it illustrates an operational procedure for practicing aspects of the present disclosure. illustrates an embodiment where presence module determines whether to update presence information or return cached information. For example presence module can be configured to execute some or all of the operations illustrated in in response to receiving a request for presence information from an application or after some or all of the operations illustrated in and or are executed.

Operation begins the procedure when for example presence module runs presence engine to update presence information or return cached information. In the illustrated operational flowchart operation illustrates that presence engine can execute and generate a quantification. For example the quantification could be calculated from an algorithm using load information from base transceiver station and timestamp information. In an exemplary embodiment the quantification could be generated from an algorithm that takes a value that represents an amount of time presence information has been stored in memory and subtracts it from a value that quantifies the load on the base transceiver station. Operation shows that the quantification can be compared to a threshold and operations and show that presence engine can update presence information e.g. receive fresh presence information and store it i.e. operation Yes . Operation sends that cached information to the application based on the result of the comparison operation i.e. operation No . Continuing with the specific example above the threshold could be set to zero. If the calculated quantification is negative e.g. load is great and length of time presence information is cached is short presence engine can be configured to return cached information. If the calculated quantification is positive then presence engine can be configured to send the request.
