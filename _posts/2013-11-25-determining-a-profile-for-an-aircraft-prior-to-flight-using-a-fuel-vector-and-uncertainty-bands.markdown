title: Determining a profile for an aircraft prior to flight using a fuel vector and uncertainty bands
abstract: A weight and center-of-gravity profile for an aircraft is determined prior to flight. An uncertainty band is determined for each of a plurality of points along a fuel vector for the planned flight. Each of the points along the fuel vector is compared to a predetermined flight limit (e.g., an FAA certified envelope). This comparison is used to decide whether the profile is suitable for flight of the aircraft. If so, an indication is provided to a user (e.g., on a display or by a text message) that the profile is suitable and the aircraft is ready for flight.

At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to data processing systems in general and more particularly but not limited to systems for determining a profile e.g. a center of gravity profile for an aircraft prior to flight based on physical characteristics of the aircraft and its load.

Accurately calculating an aircraft s weight and center of gravity CG before flight is necessary to comply with certification limits established by the aircraft manufacturer for a given aircraft. These limits include both weight and CG limits. By complying with these limits and operating under the procedures established by the aircraft manufacturer an operator is able to meet the weight and balance requirements specified in the Airplane Flight Manual AFM . Typically an operator calculates takeoff weight by adding the operational empty weight OEW of the aircraft the weight of the passengers cargo payload and the weight of fuel. When using average weights for passengers and bags the operator must be vigilant to ensure that the weight and balance control program reflects the reality of aircraft loading.

To comply with FAA regulations each operator must construct a loading envelope applicable to each aircraft being operated. The envelope will include all relevant weight and balance limitations. It will be used to ensure that the aircraft is always operated within appropriate weight and balance limitations and will include provisions to account for the loading of passengers fuel and cargo the in flight movement of passengers aircraft components and other loaded items and the usage or transfer of fuel and other consumables. The operator must be able to demonstrate that the aircraft is being operated within its certificated weight and balance limitations.

In long established prior approaches an operator curtails the manufacturer s loading limitations to account for loading variations and in flight movement that are encountered in normal operations. For example if passengers are expected to move about the cabin in flight the operator must curtail the manufacturer s CG envelope by an amount necessary to ensure that movement of passengers does not shift the aircraft s CG outside its certified envelope. If the aircraft is loaded within the new curtailed envelope it will always be operated within the manufacturer s envelope even though some of the loading parameters such as passenger seating location are not precisely known.

In some cases an aircraft may have more than one loading envelope for preflight planning and loading. Each envelope must have the appropriate curtailments applied for those variables that are expected to be relevant for that envelope. For example an aircraft might have separate takeoff in flight and landing envelopes. Passengers are expected to remain seated in the cabin during take off or landing. Therefore the takeoff and landing envelope does not need to be curtailed for passenger movement.

Upon determination of the curtailed version of each envelope the most restrictive points for each condition the operator s program will check generated by an overlay of the envelopes will form the aircraft operational envelopes. By restricting operation to these operational envelopes compliance with the manufacturer s certified envelope will be ensured in all phases of flight based upon the assumptions within the curtailment process.

Some examples of common loading curtailments to the manufacturer s loading envelope are now provided. Operators using an approved weight and balance control program include curtailments appropriate to the operations being conducted. Each of the items mentioned below is an example of a single curtailment factor. The total curtailment of the manufacturer s envelope is computed by combining the curtailments resulting from each of these factors.

As a first example the operator accounts for the seating of passengers in the cabin. The loading envelope does not need to be curtailed if the actual seating location of each passenger is known. If assigned seating is used to determine passenger location the operator must implement procedures to ensure that the assignment of passenger seating is incorporated into the loading procedure.

If the actual seating location of each passenger is not known the operator may assume that all passengers are seated uniformly throughout the cabin or a specified subsection of the cabin. If this assumption is made the operator curtails the loading envelope to account for the fact that the passenger loading may not be uniform. The curtailment may make reasonable assumptions about the manner in which people distribute themselves throughout the cabin.

As a second example the operator s curtailed loading envelope accounts for the effects of fuel. The following are examples of several types of fuel related curtailments 

 1 Fuel density. A certain fuel density may be assumed and a curtailment included to account for the possibility of different fuel density values. Fuel density curtailments only pertain to differences in fuel moment caused by varying fuel volumes not to differences in total fuel weight.

 3 Fuel usage in flight. The burning of fuel may cause the CG of the fuel load to change. The effect of fuel burning down to the required reserve fuel or to an acceptable fuel amount established by the operator should be accounted for. A curtailment is included to ensure that this change does not cause the CG of the aircraft to move outside of the acceptable envelope.

As another example the operator s curtailed CG envelope accounts for the effects of galley and lavatory fluids. These factors include such things as use of potable water in flight and movement of water or lavatory fluids.

The operational envelope also accounts for the in flight movement of passengers crew and equipment. This may be done by including a curtailment equal to the moment change caused by the motion being considered. It may be assumed that all passengers crew and equipment are secured when the aircraft is in the takeoff or landing configuration. Standard operational procedures may be taken into account.

If the manufacturer has not already done so the operator also accounts for the movement of landing gear flaps wing leading edge devices or any other moveable components of the aircraft.

Systems and methods to determine a profile for an aircraft prior to flight based on physical characteristics of the loaded aircraft e.g. at takeoff in flight and landing are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.

In one embodiment a method implemented in a data processing system includes determining via a computing apparatus a profile for an aircraft prior to flight the determining of the profile comprising determining a respective uncertainty band for each of a plurality of points along a fuel vector for the flight comparing via the computing apparatus for each respective point of the points along the fuel vector the profile to a predetermined flight limit e.g. an in flight limit a takeoff limit or a landing limit determining based on the comparing whether the profile is suitable for flight of the aircraft and providing an indication for a user that the profile is suitable.

The disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform these methods including data processing systems which perform these methods and computer readable media containing instructions which when executed on data processing systems cause the systems to perform these methods.

Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.

The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However in certain instances well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one.

Reference in this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.

The operation of an aircraft must adhere to many limitations e.g. FAA or other regulatory agency certification limits or limits imposed by the manufacturer . Some of these limits pertain to the aircraft weight and its center of gravity CG .

Besides the effect of fuel there are other processes that may contribute to changing the location of the aircraft CG. Some examples include the following flight attendants and passengers moving about the cabin the extension of flaps and the retraction of the landing gear. All these processes and effects may contribute to the uncertainty of the location of the aircraft CG during flight. shows the certified weight CG envelope of with a fuel vector that will violate the forward flight limit of the certified envelope during flight.

In traditional approaches to prevent certified envelope violations such as the one shown in operators reduce or curtail the envelope to a smaller size and load the aircraft within the limitations of this curtailed envelope. Loading the aircraft within the curtailed envelope guarantees that the certified envelope will not be violated thereby complying with the regulations. In particular fuel consumption i.e. fuel usage in flight is one of the allowances used to determine curtailment in this traditional approach.

The US Federal Aviation Administration FAA publishes for example Advisory Circular 120 27E AC 120 27E to provide operators with guidance on how to develop and receive approval for a weight and balance control program for aircraft operated under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations 14 CFR . The traditional approach of curtailing the envelope to accommodate the CG excursions inherent in the operation of an aircraft was developed to assist the operator in developing a paper based solution to the weight and balance problem. This paper based solution is commonly referred as the load sheet or trim sheet. The advent of digital computers merely allowed the automation of this same paper based solution to the weight and balance problem.

In the present disclosure below at least one embodiment provides a method to accommodate variations in an aircraft s center of gravity CG that may occur during the operation of the aircraft. Those CG variations are compared to applicable certified limitations for the aircraft in order to establish compliance prior to takeoff. Traditionally this accommodation was done with calculations done off line by technical personnel and then submitted for application to the load of a specific flight. In contrast some embodiments discussed below calculate the anticipated CG variations in real time as the aircraft load is being assessed prior to takeoff and compare the variations to the limitations applicable to the flight under consideration. Available loading margins are displayed and violations are flagged or otherwise indicated to an operator. Typical embodiments may be used to adhere to FAA AC 120 27E or other similar applicable regulations using the novel approach described below.

In one embodiment the need for the curtailed envelope along with the extensive calculations needed to produce it is eliminated by configuring a CG profile for the flight i.e. a fuel vector combined with the uncertainty bands applicable for that flight as discussed in more detail below . The CG profile is calculated in real time prior to takeoff for each applicable flight limitation e.g. takeoff in flight landing . A flight generally includes several portions. There is a takeoff portion an in flight portion and a landing portion. There typically is one or more different flight limits associated with each of these portions of the flight. For example the CG profile or only the part of the CG profile corresponding to takeoff is compared to a takeoff limit e.g. a portion of a certified envelope that corresponds to takeoff . Similarly the CG profile or only a part of the CG profile corresponding to landing may be compared to a landing limit. Finally all or only applicable parts of the CG profile may be compared to one or more limits that apply during flight i.e. the in flight portion of the flight .

For the in flight limits only the effects associated with that condition are applied movement of passengers and crew etc. For landing only the effects associated with landing are applied extension of flaps and movement of cabin crew etc. It should be noted that the curtailed envelope of the traditional approach is no longer necessary. After the CG profile is determined for a particular flight the CG profile is checked against the certified predetermined limits to determine compliance i.e. suitability of the profile is determined indicating the aircraft is ready for flight .

In various embodiments the CG profile for the flight is made up of three curves the fuel induced CG path or fuel vector and the forward and aft edges of the profile. These edges are the result of adding the prescribed moment allowances e.g. as illustrated in discussed below . They constitute the forward and aft uncertainties that are located forward and aft of the fuel induced CG path fuel vector . For example for any given point on the fuel vector these forward and aft uncertainties together provide an uncertainty band for that point e.g. see discussed below .

In one embodiment dynamically determined aircraft CG locations are used as expanded by allowances made for various CG shifting effects i.e. allowances are accumulated to define an uncertainty band around each of several points along the fuel vector . The resulting ensemble the expanded fuel vector or CG profile is then subjected to the limitations imposed by the certified envelope. These allowances are intended to account for all foreseen processes that may shift the CG of the aircraft under normal operations for example as prescribed by the Airplane Flight Manual AFM and the Weight and Balance Manual WBM or equivalent.

In this embodiment during normal operation the aircraft will experience changes in CG location associated with several processes. To avert violating the certified envelope it is necessary to identify and quantify these processes in terms of moment allowances. These are the moments generated by the CG shift associated with that process or physical characteristic . Some exemplary applicable moment allowances are described below 

 1 Fuel Density Allowance. Fuel density is assumed to vary from for example 6.3 to 7.1 lb USG. The fuel allowance accounts for the error in CG introduced by values in fuel density within this range.

 2 Fuel Burn Allowance. It should be noted that the CG changes that arise from fuel consumption are not subject to an allowance. Instead the fuel vector is compared dynamically to the applicable CG limitations certified envelope to establish that the aircraft will be in compliance with the certified envelope throughout the flight.

 3 Water Usage Allowance. Accounts for the transfer of water from the potable water storage tank to the lavatory waste tank during flight as passengers use the lavatory.

 4 Waste Water Allowance. The waste water allowance considers the water from the potable water storage tank that is discharged overboard during flight as passengers use the lavatory.

 5 Passenger Seating Allowance. In one specific example passenger seating distribution may be assumed to reflect an industry standard window aisle remaining seat assignment scheme the passenger seating allowance is thus dependent on the actual passenger count. In other embodiments the passenger allowance can be determined in many other ways.

 6 Passenger Movement Allowance. The movement of passengers throughout the cabin during flight generates moments that depend on the passenger location and the location of the lavatories.

 7 Cabin Crew Movement Allowance. Similarly the movement of the cabin crew throughout the cabin during flight generates moments that depend on the assigned seat for the flight attendant and various destinations in the cabin. No catering carts are moved in the cabin during flight.

 8 Cargo Distribution Allowance. The cargo loading allowance accounts for a possible non uniformly distributed cargo load. In one specific example cargo is assumed to be loaded from one end of the compartment towards its center for example at a rate of 10 lb. per cubic foot until all the items have been loaded limited by either the maximum weight capacity or the maximum volume capacity of that compartment. The resulting cargo load will generate a moment that is different than the moment of the same cargo load if it were loaded uniformly throughout the cargo compartment. The difference between these two moments is the cargo allowance for that compartment. The variation of moment as weight is loaded will eventually reach a maximum allowance. This maximum allowance occurs when the bin is calculated to be half full by volume. As additional weight is loaded above the weight where the maximum allowance is reached the maximum allowance will be applied. Using the root sum of the squares RSS method the allowance of each compartment is added together to calculate the total forward and aft cargo allowance. In other embodiments the cargo distribution allowance can be determined in many other ways

 9 Flap Deployment Allowance. The moment generated by the deployment of flaps slats is used as the allowance.

 10 Landing Gear Retraction Allowance. Similarly the moment generated by retraction of the landing gear is used as the allowance.

The certified envelope establishes the limits within which the weight and CG of the aircraft have to lie at any time during the operation of the aircraft however CG shifting processes introduce uncertainty to the actual location of the aircraft CG. Both the ZFW point and the takeoff weight TOW point have uncertainties associated with the location of their corresponding CGs. In the case of the TOW point the uncertainty extends towards the forward edge of the envelope away from the fuel vector and also towards the rear edge away from the fuel vector. This situation is similar for the ZFW point. These uncertainties are made up of the accumulated allowances discussed above associated with a given point on the fuel vector.

As fuel is loaded in the aircraft the aircraft CG moves from the zero fuel condition to the takeoff condition along the fuel vector. In some cases normal fuel consumption causes the aircraft CG to travel along the same curve in reverse until the main tanks reach a low fuel condition. However it should be noted that in other cases there may be alternate paths for loading and unloading fuel. In general the fuel vector does not always have the same shape for two different flights and the fuel vector may also depend on whether there are inoperative components or not such as a fuel pump.

Each point in the fuel vector has an uncertainty band. The uncertainty band represents the accumulated uncertainties allowances for the point to which it applies e.g. see discussion for below . The addition of the uncertainty band to the fuel vector creates the expanded fuel vector the CG profile .

In one embodiment the first step in establishing whether an aircraft is within prescribed limitations is to calculate the margin that exists between the zero fuel and takeoff conditions including their corresponding uncertainty bands and the applicable certified limits certified envelope . In the case of the zero fuel condition the forward zero fuel point is compared to the forward edge of the ZFW envelope. Similarly the aft zero fuel point is compared to the aft edge of the ZFW envelope. The takeoff condition is subjected to the same process in this case using the forward and aft edges of the takeoff envelope. If a violation occurs it is reported to the operator e.g. by a message or other indication on a display of a user terminal .

For the in flight checks the allowances applicable to the flight envelope are applied to each point along the fuel curve. The resulting shifted fuel curve is then compared to the forward and aft flight limits at the corresponding weight. If a violation occurs it is reported to the operator e.g. by a message or other indication on a display of a user terminal . Note that the traditional allowance for fuel consumption as used in prior approaches is not considered there is no need for such allowance if a separate assessment of envelope compliance is made for every point e.g. every point for a defined incremental increase in weight along the fuel vector. It should also be noted that in other embodiments there may be other weight CG limitations that an aircraft manufacturer may establish or that may otherwise be used in creating the CG profile. In these other embodiments the CG profile may have a shape that depends in part on these other limitations. Comparison of this shape regardless of its particular or unique form to flight limits is performed in general as described herein.

In a profile engine is connected to the server to generate a CG profile as described herein and to provide information regarding the CG profile and its comparison to flight limits to the user terminals e.g. . . . .

In the users may use the terminals e.g. . . . to customize the manner in which CG profiles are calculated e.g. selection of inputs and or the manner in which violations and or compliance results are provided when assessing suitability of a flight. For example a violation may be reported to a user terminal when any point on or portion of the CG profile goes outside of the certified envelope. The extent of this excursion may be provided in a visual manner to a user on a user terminal. The effected flight condition e.g. takeoff or in flight may also be reported along with the violation.

In one embodiment the user terminal e.g. . . . can also be used to submit some or all of the data inputs that will be used by profile engine to determine the CG profile. The users may use the user terminal in some cases to associate data inputs with certain locations and or routes for use by the profile engine .

Although illustrates an example system implemented in client server architecture embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various alternative architectures. For example the server can be implemented via a peer to peer network of user terminals where data is shared via peer to peer communication connections. In other approaches the profile engine and all related processing can be performed on a single user terminal e.g. located at a flight operation center at an airport .

In some embodiments a combination of client server architecture and peer to peer architecture can be used in which one or more centralized servers may be used to provide some of the information and or services and the peer to peer network is used to provide other information and or services.

Non volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive e.g. a DVD RAM or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non volatile memory may also be a random access memory.

The non volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non volatile memory that is remote from the system such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface can also be used.

In one embodiment the user input device and the position identification unit are configured to automatically tag data created by the user input device with the navigation information identified by the position identification unit .

Various further embodiments are now discussed below. In a method according to one embodiment a weight and center of gravity profile for an aircraft is determined prior to flight. An uncertainty band is determined for each of one or more plurality of points along a fuel vector for the planned flight. Each of the one or more points along the fuel vector is compared to a predetermined flight limit e.g. an FAA certified envelope . This comparison is used to decide whether the profile is suitable for flight of the aircraft. If so an indication is provided to a user e.g. on a display or by a text message that the profile is suitable and the aircraft is ready for flight. For example there may be a different flight limit for each portion of flight e.g. takeoff in flight and landing . In one example a single point of the fuel vector corresponds to a takeoff condition that is compared to a takeoff limit.

In one embodiment the predetermined flight limit is a weight and center of gravity envelope and each respective uncertainty band is based on a sum of forward allowances and a sum of aft allowances. These allowances are forward and aft relative to the respective given point on the fuel vector. For example shows an uncertainty band for a given point on the fuel vector where the uncertainty band is determined based on accumulated forward and aft allowances according to one embodiment. The outside edges of the uncertainty band define a portion of the perimeter of the CG profile.

In one embodiment each of the forward allowances and each of the aft allowances is determined as an allowance for a respective physical characteristic of the aircraft due to a load as calculated by a shift in distance associated with the physical characteristic multiplied by a corresponding weight for the physical characteristic. For example the physical characteristic may be cargo distribution passenger seating distribution passenger movement water usage cart movement cabin crew movement gear retraction or flap deployment.

In one embodiment the physical characteristic is cargo distribution one of the aft allowances or forward allowances is a cargo allowance for the cargo and the cargo allowance is calculated as a difference between a first moment for a uniform distribution of the cargo and a second moment for a non uniform distribution of the cargo.

In one embodiment the method further comprises determining a zero fuel weight and a zero fuel center of gravity for the aircraft wherein the fuel vector includes the zero fuel weight and the zero fuel center of gravity. The predetermined flight limit comprises take off parameters and in flight parameters wherein the take off parameters are different from the in flight parameters. The fuel vector comprises a first point corresponding to a take off condition of the aircraft and a second point corresponding to an in flight condition of the aircraft. Further the comparing of the profile to the predetermined flight limit for the first point is based on the take off parameters i.e. the profile is compared to a flight limit for takeoff and the comparing of the profile to the predetermined flight limit for the second point is based on the in flight parameters i.e. the profile is compared to a flight limit that applies during flight .

In one embodiment the method further comprises as the aircraft is being loaded for flight receiving data for a physical characteristic of the aircraft displaying for the user available margins for the profile relative to the predetermined limit updating the respective uncertainty band for at least one of the points along the fuel vector based on the received data and determining based on the updated uncertainty band whether the profile is suitable for flight of the aircraft.

In one embodiment the profile is an area in a two dimensional weight and center of gravity space having a perimeter and portions of the perimeter located on each side of the fuel vector are determined by the uncertainty bands of the plurality of points of the fuel vector. In one example the method further comprises causing a presentation of the area to the user on a display in a user interface. In another example an indication that the profile is suitable for flight is provided to a user via a display of the computing apparatus and or by sending a communication to a user terminal.

In one embodiment the method further comprises receiving via the computing apparatus rules that define an operation of the aircraft when in flight wherein at least one of the uncertainty bands of the plurality of points is determined based on the rules.

The calculation of an exemplary moment allowance is now provided. For example an allowance for cabin crew in flight movement forward is calculated as follows 

In this description various functions and operations may be described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor such as a microprocessor. Alternatively or in combination the functions and operations can be implemented using special purpose circuitry with or without software instructions such as using an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA . Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions or in combination with software instructions. Thus the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer readable media used to actually effect the distribution.

At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied at least in part in software. That is the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor such as a microprocessor executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory such as ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory cache or a remote storage device.

Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system middleware service delivery platform SDK Software Development Kit component web services or other specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as computer programs. Invocation interfaces to these routines can be exposed to a software development community as an API Application Programming Interface . The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.

A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory and or cache. Portions of this software and or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically just in time when needed for execution. Thus it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.

Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non recordable type media such as volatile and non volatile memory devices read only memory ROM random access memory RAM flash memory devices floppy and other removable disks magnetic disk storage media optical storage media e.g. Compact Disk Read Only Memory CD ROMS Digital Versatile Disks DVDs etc. among others. The computer readable media may store the instructions.

The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical optical acoustical or other forms of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. However propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.

In general a tangible machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides e.g. stores information in a form accessible by a machine e.g. a computer network device personal digital assistant manufacturing tool any device with a set of one or more processors etc. .

In various embodiments hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

Although some operations may be described in a particular order operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware firmware software or any combination thereof.

In the foregoing specification the disclosure has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope as set forth in the following claims. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense.
