title: Out-of band configuration of BIOS setting data
abstract: In certain aspects, a system for out-of-band configuring BIOS setting data (BIOSSD) includes a host computer and a service processor (SP). The SP stores a BIOSSD collection and a human interface data (HID) collection. The HID collection includes questions for data of the BIOSSD collection and corresponding options for each question. When a remote management computer sends to the SP an information request, the SP retrieves the HID collection and transmits the questions and the corresponding options to the remote management computer. In response to a command indicating a selected corresponding option, the SP changes corresponding data of the BIOSSD collection according to the command. When the BIOS executed at the host computer issues a BIOSSD update request to the SP, the SP transmits a copy of the BIOSSD collection to the BIOS chip of the host computer to replace the BIOSSD collection stored in the BIOS chip.

The present disclosure relates generally to updating basic input output system BIOS setting data and particularly to system and method for out of band OOB configuration of BIOS setting data.

The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors to the extent it is described in this background section as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.

The Basic Input Output System BIOS is one of the most crucial components on a computer motherboard. The BIOS software is preloaded into a memory the BIOS memory of the BIOS and typically is the first code run by a computer when powered on. When the computer starts up the first job for the BIOS is the power on self test which initializes and identifies the system devices such as the CPU RAM video display card keyboard and mouse hard disk drive optical disc drive and other hardware. The BIOS then locates a boot loader software held on a peripheral device designated as a boot device such as a hard disk or a CD DVD and loads and executes that software giving it control of the operating system OS . This process is known as booting or booting up which is short for bootstrapping.

Generally the BIOS may have a number of settings that can be configured by a user of the computer. The BIOS provides console access for a user to modify the configuration of the BIOS settings during the startup of the host computer. The host computer may provide with applications to update the BIOS settings from the operating systems. For example the host computer may include an application to switch the CPU of the host computer from a protected mode which is a normal operation mode to a system management mode SMM which is a special management mode.

However in certain occasions there is a need for the user of the host computer to configure the BIOS settings without entering the management mode. For example when the user connects to the host computer from a remote client device and attempts to change the BIOS settings remotely the user may not want to interrupt the operation of the host computer.

Therefore an unaddressed need exists in the art to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.

Non limiting examples of the non transitory tangible computer readable medium are nonvolatile memory magnetic storage and optical storage.

The host computer may be a general purpose computer system or a headless computer system. As shown in the host computer includes a baseboard or the motherboard not shown and a storage .

The baseboard is a printed circuit board to which a multitude of components or devices may be connected by way of a system bus or other electrical communication paths. Although not explicitly shown in the components on the baseboard are interconnected and the layout of the components on the baseboard and the manner of the interconnection between the components on the baseboard is herein referred to as the configuration of the baseboard. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the configuration of the baseboard may be adjusted or changed according to the necessary design or manufacturing requirements.

The components on the baseboard of the host computer include but not limited to a central processing unit CPU a memory a BIOS chip and other required memory and Input Output I O modules not shown . The SP may also be a component on the baseboard. In certain embodiments the CPU the memory the BIOS chip and the SP may be embedded on the baseboard or may be connected to the baseboard through an interface. In certain embodiments the interface may be physical hardware interface such as electrical connectors buses ports cables terminals or other I O devices. Further the host computer includes a storage which is a data storage media for storing the OS not shown and other applications of the host computer .

The CPU is a host processor which is configured to control operation of the host computer . The host processor can execute an operating system OS or other applications of the host computer . In certain embodiments the host computer may run on or more than one CPU as the host processor such as two CPUs four CPUs eight CPUs or any suitable number of CPUs.

The memory can be a volatile memory such as the random access memory RAM for storing the data and information during the operation of the host computer .

The BIOS chip is one of the most crucial components in the host computer or any computer system. In certain embodiments the BIOS chip is a non volatile memory such as a flash memory chip an EEPROM chip or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS memory.

As shown in the BIOS chip stores a BIOS software hereinafter BIOS a BIOS setting data BIOSSD collection a BIOS user interface UI and a human interface data HID collection . The BIOS is configured to perform the startup functions or the booting functions for the host computer . Examples of the booting functions include but are not limited to the initiation and power on self test identifying the system devices locating the boot loader software on the boot device loading and executing the boot loader software and giving it control of the operating system OS . The BIOSSD collection is a BIOSSD collection that includes all data and information related to the BIOS settings.

The BIOS UI is a BIOS console application to provide a user interface for the user at the host computer to change the BIOS setting data in the BIOSSD collection . Examples of the BIOS UI may include a web user interface WUI a command line interface CLI a common information model CIM interface or any other text mode interface or graphical interface.

The WUI is an interface with a web based application that provides information to the user or client in a web page format. In certain embodiments the WUI may include a web page and a browser program. The web page may include information stored in the HID collection . The browser program is a software application for retrieving presenting and traversing the information in the web page to the user. For displaying the information such as the web page and other data contents using the browser program HyperText Markup Language HTML is a standardized markup language in a web based language format. When the browser program is launched the user may open the web page using the browser program read the information of the HID collection displayed on the web page and issue commands through the browser program.

The CLI is an interface with a software program where the user or client issues commands to the software program in the form of successive lines of text command lines . The software program that implements such a text interface is often called a command line interpreter a command processor or a shell which can be in principle any program that constitutes the user interface.

The CIM is an open standard defined and published by the Distributed Management Task Force DMTF . The CIM standard defines how managed elements in an information technology IT environment are represented as a common set of objects and relationships between them. This is intended to allow consistent management of these managed elements independent of their manufacturer or provider. The CIM standard allows multiple parties to exchange management information about these managed elements. Further the CIM standard not only represents these managed elements and the management information but also provides means to actively control and manage these elements. By using a common model of information management software can be written once and work with many implementations of the common model without complex and costly conversion operations or loss of information. One of the features of the CIM standard is the CIM Schema which is a conceptual schema defining the specific set of objects and relationships between them that represent a common base for the managed elements in an IT environment. The CIM Schema covers most of today s elements in an IT environment for example computer systems operating systems networks middleware services and storage. The CIM Schema defines a common basis for representing these managed elements. Since most managed elements have product and vendor specific behavior the CIM Schema is extensible in order to allow the producers of these elements to represent their specific features seamlessly together with the common base functionality defined in the CIM Schema.

Many vendors provide implementations of CIM in various forms. For example Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer version provides the Windows Management Instrumentation WMI application programming interface API which implements the CIM Schema. Some server manufacturers collaborate in the DMTF under the Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware SMASH initiative to define CIM based management of servers. A related standard is Web Based Enterprise Management WBEM also defined by DMTF which defines a particular implementation of CIM including protocols for discovering and accessing such CIM implementations.

In certain embodiments a CIM XML protocol which is also standardized by the DMTF is used as a protocol for performing sending CIM messages on top of HTTP. The CIM XML protocol includes two message types. One type of the CIM XML messages relates to the operational messages which provoke a response from the receiver RPC . The other type of the CIM XML messages relates to export messages which are indications of events.

The HID collection stores a plurality of questions to the user regarding each data in the BIOSSD collection and the corresponding options for each question. For example one of the BIOS settings in the BIOSSD collection may be the CPU clock rate which refers to the frequency of the CPU . The HID collection may provide a question asking the user about the CPU clock rate and a plurality of predetermined options of the CPU clock rate. When the BIOS UI displays the question to the user the user may choose a CPU clock rate from the predetermined options. In certain embodiments each of the corresponding options includes the name of the corresponding data in the BIOSSD collection for example the CPU clock rate and a value the frequency of the CPU .

The storage is a data storage media for storing the OS not shown and other applications of the host computer . Examples of the storage may include flash memory memory cards USB drives hard drives floppy disks optical drives or any other types of data storage devices.

In certain embodiments the host computer may include at least one I O device not shown for generating and controlling input and output signals of the host computer . Examples of the I O device include keyboards touch pads mouse microphones display screens touch screens or other I O devices applicable for the host computer . Some I O devices such as touch screens are provided for the dual input output purposes.

In certain embodiments the CPU of the host computer can operate in a protected mode which is a native operating mode of the processor or in a system management mode SMM . SMM is a special purpose operating mode provided for handling system wide functions like power management system hardware control or proprietary OEM designed code. It is intended for use only by system firmware not by applications software or general purpose systems software. The main benefit of SMM is that it offers a distinct and easily isolated processor environment that operates transparently to the operating system or executive and software applications.

In certain embodiments SMM is entered through activation of an external system interrupt pin which generates a system management interrupt SMI . The external system interrupt pin is hereinafter referred to as the SMI . In SMM the CPU switches to a separate address space while saving the context of the currently running program or task. SMM specific code may then be executed transparently. Upon returning from SMM the CPU is placed back into its state prior to the SMI.

In certain embodiments the BIOS can set up the SMM for the CPU . For example when the BIOS is launched the CPU loads the BIOS into the BIOS area and executes the BIOS . Further the BIOS can load the SMI handler codes to the SMRAM area . The SMI handler is configured to load some or all of the components of the BIOS .

When SMM is invoked through the SMI the CPU saves the current state i.e. the context of the processor in the CPU context area of the memory and switches to a separate operating environment contained in the SMRAM area . While in SMM the CPU loads and executes the SMI handler codes to perform operations such as powering down unused disk drives or monitors executing proprietary code placing the whole system in a suspended state or updating the BIOS settings in the BIOS chip . Specifically the SMI handler codes may include a SMM program and an SMM loader program to the area storing the SMI handler codes . When the CPU enters the SMM and executes the SMI handler codes the SMM loader program can load the SMM program into the SMRAM and then transfer control of the CPU to the SMM program.

When the SMI handler has completed its operations it executes a resume RSM instruction. This RSM instruction causes the CPU to reload the saved context in the CPU context area switch back to the protected or real mode and resume executing the interrupted application or operating system program or task.

The SP refers to a specialized microcontroller that manages the interface between system management software and platform hardware. In certain embodiments the SP may be a baseboard management controller BMC . Thus different types of sensors can be built into the host computer and the SP reads these sensors to obtain parameters such as temperature cooling fan speeds power status OS status etc.

The SP monitors the sensors and can send alerts to a system administrator at the remote management computer via the network if any of the parameters do not stay within preset limits indicating a potential failure of the host computer . The administrator can also remotely communicate with the SP from the remote management computer via the network to take some corrective action such as resetting or power cycling the host computer to get a hung OS running again.

As shown in the SP includes a memory and a non volatile memory . The memory can be a volatile memory such as the RAM for storing the data and information during the operation of the SP .

The non volatile memory stores the firmware of the SP . As shown in the firmware of the SP includes among other things a BIOSSD update module a BIOSSD collection a HID collection and a UI server module . In certain embodiments the BIOSSD collection and the HID collection form a BIOS configuration library. In certain embodiments the firmware may include a web connection module not shown for communication with the network .

When the BIOS sends an update request to the SP for updating the BIOSSD collection in the BIOS chip the BIOSSD update module may in response to the update request transmit a copy of the BIOSSD collection from the SP to the BIOS chip via the KCS interface or the USB interface to replace the BIOSSD collection in the BIOS chip .

It should be noted that the operation of the BIOSSD update module is independent from the state of the host computer . In other words the BIOSSD update module enables the OOB update of the BIOSSD collection in the SP .

The BIOSSD collection is a BIOSSD collection or a copy of the BIOS settings stored in the non volatile memory of the SP . Generally when the BIOSSD collection stored in the BIOS chip does not change the BIOSSD collection is an exact copy of the BIOSSD collection .

When the remote UI of the remote management computer sends a command indicating the selected corresponding option to the SP the UI server module receives the command and changes one of the data of the BIOSSD collection according to the selected corresponding option indicated by the command. Thus the BIOSSD collection in the SP will be updated without interrupting the operation of the host computer .

The HID collection stores the questions to the user regarding each data in the BIOSSD collection and the corresponding options for each question. In certain embodiments the HID collection can be an exact copy of the HID collection stored in the BIOS chip . For example one of the BIOS settings in the BIOSSD collection may be the CPU clock rate which refers to the frequency of the CPU . The HID collection may provide a question asking the user about the CPU clock rate and a plurality of predetermined options of the CPU clock rate. When the BIOS UI displays the question to the user the user may choose a CPU clock rate from the predetermined options. In certain embodiments each of the corresponding options includes the name of the corresponding data in the BIOSSD collection for example the CPU clock rate and a value the frequency of the CPU .

In response to the commands from the remote UI of the remote management computer for the information of the HID collection the UI server module retrieves the information from the HID collection and transmits the retrieved information to the remote UI of the remote management computer via the network . The retrieved information from the HID collection may include the questions for each data in the BIOSSD collection and the corresponding options for each data.

The UI server module is a server application for the remote UI of the remote management computer . In certain embodiments the UI server module receives a request from the remote UI of the remote management computer to establish a network connection and in response to the request sends a response message to the remote UI to establish the network connection. Once the network connection is established the remote UI of the remote management computer may send commands for the information of the HID collection to the UI server module via the network . In response to the commands the UI server module retrieves the information from the HID collection and sends the retrieved information to the remote UI via the network . The retrieved information from the HID collection may include the questions for each data in the BIOSSD collection and the corresponding options for each data. Thus a user at the remote management computer may use the remote UI to select the corresponding options for each question in order to change the data of the BIOSSD collection .

When the UI server module receives a command from the remote UI indicating that the user selects one of the corresponding options for a question to change one of the data of the BIOSSD collection the UI server module changes one of the data of the BIOSSD collection according to the selected corresponding option indicated by the command.

In certain embodiments the UI server module receives a request from the remote UI of the remote management computer to establish a network connection and in response to the request sends a response message to the remote UI to establish the network connection. Once the network connection is established the remote UI of the remote management computer may send commands for the information of the HID collection to the UI server module via the network. In response to the commands the UI server module retrieves the information from the HID collection and sends the retrieved information to the remote UI via the network . The retrieved information from the HID collection may include the questions for each data in the BIOSSD collection and the corresponding options for each data. Thus a user at the remote management computer may use the remote UI to select the corresponding options for each question in order to change the data of the BIOSSD collection .

When the UI server module receives a command from the remote UI indicating that the user selects one of the corresponding options for a question to change one of the data of the BIOSSD collection the UI server module changes one of the data of the BIOSSD collection according to the selected corresponding option indicated by the command.

As discussed above the UI server module serves as the server application for the remote UI of the remote management computer . Examples of the UI server module may include a web server application a CLI server application or a CIM server application.

In certain embodiments when the WUI is implemented in a client server structure the remote UI can be a browser program and the UI server module can be a web server application. The web server application may retrieve the information of the HID collection and generate a corresponding web page for the WUI to display. As discussed above the WUI may include a browser program. When the WUI is launched the browser program may request and receive the web page from the web server application such that the browser program may display the web page to the user.

In certain embodiments when the CLI is implemented in a client server structure the remote UI can be a text based client program and the UI server module can be a text based server application in communication with the remote UI through text based protocols. Examples of the text based protocols include telnet or secure shell SSH . The text based server application may retrieve the information of the HID collection and send the information to the client application through the telnet or SSH protocols.

In certain embodiments when the CIM is implemented in a client server structure the remote UI can be a CIM client program and the UI server module can be a CIM server application in communication with the remote UI through the CIM schema such as the CIM XML protocol. As discussed above many vendors provide implementations of CIM in various forms. For example Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer version provides the Windows Management Instrumentation WMI application programming interface API which implements the CIM Schema. Some server manufacturers collaborate in the DMTF under the Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware SMASH initiative to define CIM based management of servers. A related standard is Web Based Enterprise Management WBEM also defined by DMTF which defines a particular implementation of CIM including protocols for discovering and accessing such CIM implementations.

In certain embodiments a CIM XML protocol which is also standardized by the DMTF is used as a protocol for performing sending CIM messages on top of HTTP. The CIM XML protocol includes two message types. One type of the CIM XML messages relates to the operational messages which provoke a response from the receiver RPC . The other type of the CIM XML messages relates to export messages which are indications of events.

The remote management computer can be a local mobile device serving as the client device of the system which is subject to receive actions from the user. As shown in the remote management computer is remotely connected to the SP of the host computer via the network . One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the system may include a plurality of remote management computer . Examples of the remote management computer may include for example portable devices such as smartphones tablets or other mobile computer devices.

As shown in the remote management computer includes a storage . Although not explicitly shown in the remote management computer may have a baseboard with a CPU and a memory embedded thereon and at least one I O device such that the remote management computer is operable independently without being connected to the SP of the host computer .

The storage is a data storage media for storing the OS not shown and other applications of the remote management computer . Examples of the storage may include flash memory memory cards USB drives hard drives floppy disks optical drives or any other types of data storage devices. As shown in the storage stores a remote UI .

The remote UI is an application program to provide a user interface for the user at the remote management computer to change the BIOS setting data in the BIOSSD collection stored in the SP . In certain embodiments the remote UI serves as the client application for the BIOSSD update module of the SP . Examples of the remote UI may include a WUI client application such as a browser program a CLI client application such as a telnet or SSH application a CIM client application or any other text mode interface or graphical interface client application. In certain embodiments the remote UI provides a user interface which is same as or similar to the interface provided by the BIOS UI .

When the remote UI is launched the remote UI sends a request to the SP to establish a network connection. When the remote UI receives a response message from the UI server module in response to the request the network connection is established. Once the network connection is established the remote UI of the remote management computer may send commands for the information of the HID collection to the UI server module via the network. In response to the commands the UI server module may retrieve the information from the HID collection and sends the retrieved information to the remote UI via the network . The retrieved information from the HID collection may include the questions for each data in the BIOSSD collection and the corresponding options for each data. When the remote UI receives the retrieved information the remote UI may display the questions and the corresponding options to a user at the remote management computer . Thus the user may use the remote UI to select one or more of the corresponding options in response to the questions. Once the user selects a corresponding option the remote UI may send a command based on the selected corresponding option to the SP via the network .

The KCS interface is an interface often used between a SP and a payload processor in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface IPMI architecture. IPMI is an industry standard for system monitoring and event recovery. The IPMI specification provides a common message based interface for accessing all of the manageable features in a compatible computer. IPMI includes a rich set of predefined commands for reading temperature voltage fan speed chassis intrusion and other parameters. System event logs hardware watchdogs and power control can also be accessed through IPMI. In this manner IPMI defines protocols for accessing the various parameters collected by a SP through an operating system or through an external connection such as through a network or serial connection. Additional details regarding IPMI can be found in the IPMI Specification Version 2.0 which is publicly available from INTEL CORPORATION and which is incorporated herein by reference.

In certain embodiments a user may use IPMI original equipment manufacturer OEM messages to control data transmission via the KCS interface . Specifically in addition to the standard predefined commands and parameters IPMI allows OEM extensions for the manufacturers and users to define OEM specific commands. In certain embodiments the IPMI OEM messages may be used for transmission of the BIOSSD collections between the BIOS chip and the SP .

The USB interface is an industry standardized interface for the connection of computer peripherals. In certain embodiments the USB interface is a USB port. In certain embodiments the firmware of the SP may include a USB emulation module to emulate a USB drive which is virtually connected to the USB interface . Thus when the host computer attempts to access the emulated USB drive the CPU instructs the USB interface to access the USB emulation module of the SP .

As shown in the remote management computer is connected to the SP via the network . In certain embodiments data transmission between the SP and the remote management computer may be under the Internet protocols such as the TCP IP protocol.

In certain embodiments the remote UI of the remote management computer and the UI server module of the SP constitute a client server structure of the user interface. Examples of the user interface may include a WUI a CLI a CIM interface or any other text mode interface or graphical interface. For example when WUI is used as the user interface the UI server module can be a web server application generating and transmitting the web page and the remote UI can be a browser program receiving and displaying the web page. When CLI is used the UI server module can be a telnet or SSH server application providing text based information and the remote UI can be a telnet or SSH client program sending and receiving text based commands.

As discussed above a user at the remote management computer may attempt to change the BIOS settings remotely without interrupting the operation of the host computer . To achieve such goal the user may remotely change the BIOSSD collection stored in the SP without changing the actual BIOS settings of the BIOSSD collection in the BIOS chip.

Referring to at procedure the remote UI initiates. In certain embodiments the remote management computer may download the remote UI from a web server such as the web server at the SP and stores the remote UI in the storage . Then the remote management computer may execute the remote UI for initiation.

At procedure the remote UI sends a command to the SP via the network to establish the network connection. For example when WUI is used the remote UI which is a browser program may attempt to create a connection to the web server application the UI server module by sending a HTTP request to the SP to establish a transmission connection protocol TCP connection to a particular port generally port of the server. When CLI is used the remote UI which is a telnet or SSH program may attempt to create a connection to the server the BIOSSD update module by sending a request to the server to establish a TCP connection to a particular port for telnet generally port and for SSH generally port of the server.

At procedure the UI server module i.e. the web server application receives the request from the remote UI . Upon receiving the request at procedure the BIOSSD update module responds to the request by sending a response message to the remote management computer via the network . At procedure the remote UI receives the response message and the connection is established.

At procedure the remote UI sends a command for the information of the HID collection to the SP via the network . At procedure the UI server module receives the command. At procedure the UI server module retrieves the information from the HID collection according to the command. The retrieved information from the HID collection may include the questions for each data in the BIOSSD collection and the corresponding options for each data.

Referring to at procedure the UI server module sends the retrieved information of from the HID collection to the remote management computer via the network . At procedure the remote UI receives the retrieved information .

Once the remote UI receives the information at procedure the remote UI displays the questions and the corresponding options in the received information on the remote management computer such that the user may read the questions and select the corresponding options accordingly.

At procedure the remote UI determines whether the user has selected any of the corresponding options to change the BIOS settings. If the user does not select any corresponding option the remote UI ends the update process. If the user selects one or more corresponding options the remote UI enters procedure .

At procedure the remote UI sends to the SP via the network a command of indicating the selected option. At procedure the UI server module receives the command. At procedure the UI server module updates the BIOSSD collection by changing one of the data of the BIOSSD collection according to the selected option indicated by the command. Thus the BIOSSD collection has been changed without interrupting the operation of the host computer .

When the BIOS sends an update request to the SP for updating the BIOSSD collection in the BIOS chip the BIOSSD update module may transmit a copy of the BIOSSD collection from the SP to the BIOS chip via the KCS interface or the USB interface to replace the BIOSSD collection in the BIOS chip . In certain embodiments the BIOSSD update module transmits a copy of the BIOSSD collection from the SP to the BIOS chip only when the BIOSSD collection is updated. In other words if the user does not remotely change the BIOSSD collection the BIOSSD update module does not transmit a copy of the unchanged BIOSSD collection from the SP to the BIOS chip .

In certain embodiments the BIOS may send the update request to the SP during the startup process of the BIOS chip. In certain embodiments the host computer is powered up and the CPU loads and executes the BIOS . Then the BIOS sends the update request to the SP .

In certain embodiments the BIOS may send the update request to the SP during the SMM. In certain embodiments the host computer boots up and executes the OS. The OS can include a BIOSSD update program. The BIOSSD update program can initiate an SMI and trigger the CPU to enter the SMM. When the CPU executes in the SMM the CPU executes the SMI handler stored in the SMRAM area . The SMI handler in turn loads and executes some or all components of the BIOS . Then the BIOS enters procedure .

As discussed above the configuring process of BIOSSD is an OOB process. In other words the user at the remote management computer may remotely perform the OOB BIOSSD replicating process independent from the current operation states of the host computer . The process can be performed even when the OS is running at the host computer or when the host computer is powered off.

The method as described in the embodiments of the present disclosure can be used in the field of but not limited to OOB configuring BIOS settings in a computer system. In certain embodiments the method is performed remotely without accessing the console of the host computer .
