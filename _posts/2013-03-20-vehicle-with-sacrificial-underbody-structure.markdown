title: Vehicle with sacrificial underbody structure
abstract: A vehicle has a sacrificial buoyancy structure for attenuating damage to the vehicle body due to an under-vehicle explosion. The vehicle has a primary hull, connector plates disposed along the primary hull, track assemblies mounted to the connector plates, and gussets attaching the connector plates to the primary hull. The connection of the gussets to the primary hull is sacrificial in that a sufficient amount of explosive force detaches the gussets, connector plates and track assemblies from the primary hull, whereby the gussets, connector plates and track assemblies absorb a portion of the explosive force. The vehicle further has cross rods disposed between the connector plates and affixed thereto. The vehicle also has a sacrificial buoyancy hull beneath the primary hull attached to the cross members wherein the buoyancy hull, connector plates and primary hull form an enclosed buoyancy compartment enabling the vehicle to float on water.

The invention described here may be made used and licensed by and for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without paying royalty to us.

In one respect the invention relates to the art of designing military land vehicles for amphibious operation and particularly relates to the use of enclosed compartments in the land vehicle hull to provide buoyancy for the vehicle. In another respect the invention relates to the art of armoring underbodies of vehicles to counter explosions under the vehicle from land mines or like munitions. In still a further respect the invention relates to the use of sacrificial components of a vehicle that are destroyed or blown off the vehicle by a land mine blast so as to absorb energy from the blast.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 564 984 to Mirabella et al discloses an enclosed buoyancy compartment on the bottom of the vehicle the Mirabella vehicle may be regarded as amphibious in that it has wheels and that can engage a platform . It is also known to employ either a generally V shaped hull on a vehicle to enhance its ability to resist or survive mine blasts or similar explosions occurring under the vehicle. See for example U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008 0173167A1 of Mills et al and U.S. Pat. No. 7 997 182 B1 to Cox. U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011 0079978 A1 of Schreiner discusses at paragraph 0004 the possible effects of an under vehicle explosion on the undercarriage and axle of a vehicle. Schreiner at paragraph 0009 describes side plates under a vehicle which crumple under the force of an explosion so as to absorb blast energy these side plates also have openings to direct blast force toward the vehicle hull. Additionally U.S. Pat. No. 5 947 520 to McHorse discloses an elongate sacrificial fairing disposed near a wheel well of a vehicle.

Our invention is a vehicle having a sacrificial structure for attenuating damage to selected portions of the vehicle and the vehicle s crew due to blast force from an under vehicle explosion. The sacrificial structure includes elements of the vehicle track and track mounting mechanisms which interconnect and cooperate with elements of a vehicle buoyancy compartment. Our invention is mainly intended for armored vehicles having a typical military vehicle body though the invention is suitable for other vehicles as well. The vehicle has a primary hull and elongate connector plates disposed along sides of the primary hull to which the vehicle s track assemblies are mounted. The connector plates are affixed to the primary hull by a set of gussets. The connections of the gussets to the primary hull are sacrificial since a sufficiently large blast force detaches the gussets from the primary hull thereby detaching the connector plates and the track assemblies from the primary hull as well. The detached gussets connector plates and track assemblies absorb a portion of the blast force that would otherwise affect the primary hull. Cross rods are disposed between the connector plates and affixed thereto. The connection between the cross rod and connector plates can be stronger than the connection between the gussets and the primary hull whereby the connector plates are tilted outward of the vehicle by a sufficiently large blast force originating under the vehicle. A buoyancy hull beneath the primary hull is attached to the cross members the connector plates and the primary hull. The buoyancy hull connector plates and primary hull form an enclosed buoyancy compartment capable of keeping the vehicle afloat in a body of water. The buoyancy hull is more easily shattered than the primary hull and is sacrificed during under vehicle explosions to absorb force that would otherwise impact the primary hull. Additionally there are blast relief ports in the connector plates and sacrificial sub plates fitting in the blast relief ports the sub plates more easily shattered than the primary hull. The connector plates gussets track assemblies and cross rods have varied juxtapositions comprising a pre blast juxtaposition wherein the connector plates are generally vertically oriented the gussets are positioned such that gusset legs are also vertically oriented and the cross rods are straight a first post blast configuration wherein the connector plates tilt outward relative to the vehicle the track assemblies tilt with the connector plates the gussets tilt with the connector plates and the cross rods are bent by the movement of the gussets and a second post blast configuration wherein the gussets the connector plates the track assemblies and the cross rods are blown off the vehicle. The gussets the connector plates and the cross rods form an anti hop mechanism by redirecting momentum from blast debris during the first post blast configuration essentially the connector plates deflect a portion of the blast force upward relative to the vehicle.

The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood by one skilled in the appropriate art.

The singular forms such as a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example reference to a material includes reference to one or more of such materials and an element includes reference to one or more of such elements.

As used herein substantial and about when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material dimension characteristic parameter and the like refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly substantially free of or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition characteristic or property. Particularly assemblies that are identified as being substantially free of are either completely absent of the characteristic or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.

Concentrations values dimensions amounts and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub range is explicitly recited. For example a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units 3 dimensional units 10 dimensional units and the like and sub ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units and the like.

For a vehicle and a system mounted on or used in connection with the vehicle forward reverse longitudinal and vertical up down directions are generally relative to the vehicle and system as typically operated e.g. when the vehicle is operated with the respective powertrain in a forward reverse mode . As such lateral left right directions are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal vertical plane and are referenced from a vehicle operator e.g. driver perspective. A first direction e.g. forward and a second direction e.g. rearward or reverse where the second direction substantially but not necessarily wholly opposes the first direction are also generally or used in connection with the vehicle. Likewise elements located mounted positioned placed installed etc. on near or proximate to the vehicle body are generally referred to as inner while elements that are distal or more remote to the vehicle body are generally referred to as outer unless otherwise noted. As such inner elements are generally closer to the vehicle body than outer elements. Unless otherwise stated a vehicle is presumed to be standing on a horizontal surface and vehicle components such as a body panel or window that are vertically oriented are disposed normal to the horizontal surface. Likewise the vertical or a vertical plane refers to a plane normal to the horizontal surface upon which the vehicle rests.

In is shown a notional tracked military vehicle incorporating our sacrificial buoyancy hull structure. The vehicle has a primary hull on a conventional tracked vehicle body the hull having a generally V shaped lateral cross section formed by two oblique panels and an inverted channel therebetween. Fore hull panel of the primary hull encloses the front portion of the hull via seamed edge connections to panels to the fore end of channel and to the interface between body and hull at edge line at . An aft primary hull panel not shown similarly encloses the aft end of hull via seamed connections to panels the aft end of channel and body . The fore hull panel s configuration and interfaces is representative of the configuration and interfaces of the aft hull panel although these hull panels need not be exactly the same.

A set of gussets are affixed to elongate track connector plates wherein gusset legs fit against and connect to the inboard sides of the connector plates. Gussets are affixed to panels so that the gussets are the means by which connector plates are attached to oblique panels and primary hull . Conventional track assemblies are mounted to plates . A more detailed view of a conventional track assembly is shown at reference numeral in . Affixed to and connected between connector plates are transverse cross rods disposed near the fore and aft ends of the connector plates. Optionally as shown in phantom lines a longitudinal rod can be affixed between cross rods so that all the rods together form an I shaped frame. In vehicle is shown with a buoyancy hull disposed beneath main hull . show what is essentially the same as vehicle but with more detail of the vehicle body and track assemblies being presented. The numbering scheme for is analogous to in in that the reference numerals for have an a suffix for elements corresponding to those in .

Returning to the two hulls and form with connector plates an air filled buoyancy compartment that keeps vehicle afloat as it fords or travels over a body of water the compartment preferably being watertight or very nearly so. Buoyancy hull is comprised of a bottom buoyancy plate affixed to cross rods and is plate is also affixed to longitudinal rod if the longitudinal rod is utilized on vehicle . The buoyancy hull also comprises a fore buoyancy plate attached to and fitting with fore panel bottom plate and connector plates . Similar to fore buoyancy plate but not shown is an aft buoyancy plate attached to and fitting with the aft primary hull panel bottom buoyancy plate and connector plates wherein the fore buoyancy plate s configuration and interfaces are representative of the configuration and interfaces of the aft buoyancy plate.

Preferably the buoyancy hull plates are formed of material that shatters or is pulverized when a sufficient blast force occurs under vehicle so that the buoyancy hull s shattering or pulverizing absorbs some of this blast force before it impacts primary hull . Preferably too buoyancy hull covers the primary hull s bottom from beneath and the buoyancy hull is constructed of relatively weaker and more frangible material than are primary hull and connector plates .

The connection of gussets to panels may be regarded as a sacrificial connection since gussets will detach from panels if sufficient blast force results from an explosion beneath vehicle . Thus connector plates and track assemblies will fly off vehicle when relatively powerful explosions occur under the vehicle. The track assembles and connector plates will thereby absorb a portion of the blast energy from the explosion and prevent that portion of the blast energy from affecting primary hull the rest of vehicle and the soldiers or crew occupying vehicle . The connector plates have blast relief ports in which are fit window like sub plates which can be made of the same material as the buoyancy plate preferably such that sub plates shatter before oblique panels or connector plates are significantly damaged. The shattering of sub plates absorbs energy from an under vehicle explosion that would otherwise be imparted to oblique panels connector plates or track assembly .

The connection of cross rods to connector plates may be stronger than the connection gussets to oblique panels of primary hull . In this case if an under vehicle explosion occurs gussets will detach from oblique panels before connector plates detach from cross rods . For this reason during such an explosion connector plates gussets and track assembly begin to be tilted outward by the explosion as shown in . As shown in exaggerated fashion in the tilting of gusset plates will bend oblique panels slightly in an inner zone where inboard gusset anchor elements contact these panels. On the other hand outboard anchor elements of gussets contact another outer zone of oblique panels where edges of the oblique panels form a cross sectionally Z shaped region of primary hull . Consequently the outer zone where anchor element attaches is more rigid than the inner zone where anchor element attaches. Anchor elements tend to detach from oblique panels before anchor elements since oblique panels move more in concert with anchor elements than with anchor elements whereby anchor elements maintain contact with oblique panels after anchor element detaches from panels and gusset tilts outward.

The tilting continues as shown in where gussets are breaking away from oblique panels . The tilting of connector plates exerts a bending force on cross rods so that these rods are strained and ultimately absorb force via deformation in addition to the force absorbed by the connector plates and track assemblies. Cross rods may thus be regarded as tri functional these rods are part of a frame supporting bottom buoyancy plate fore buoyancy plate and the aft buoyancy plate they facilitate tilting of connector plates during and under vehicle explosion and they deform during an explosion to absorb some of the energy thereof.

For a time while anchor element is still connected to oblique panel the tilting of connector plate during an under vehicle explosion has a desirable anti hop effect on vehicle . Hop as that term is used here refers to the rapid upward acceleration of a vehicle occurring when land mines or like munitions explode under a vehicle. The sudden upward acceleration or hop can cause severe injuries to vehicle crew members particularly to the crew s spinal columns. For purposes of describing the anti hop effect let it be assumed that a mine or IED improvised explosive device detonates at point A in and produces a generally hemispherical expanding shock wave front as is typical for such munitions. Accompanying the shock wave is a hemispherical expanding body of debris containing flying soil rock and other material. When the debris strikes the outwardly tilted connector plate some momentum from the debris is transferred to connector plate and track assembly the transferred momentum having a vertically downward component. For the time while connector plates and track assembly are still connected to vehicle the downward component of the transferred momentum will inhibit the upward rise or hop of vehicle . Likewise the shock wave will act on connector plate and when plate is tilted outward the shock wave causes a downward force on plate and track assembly and thus causes a downward force on vehicle . Some portion of the debris and shock wave impacting connector plate may be deflected toward and impact a lower ground facing surface of primary hull but this deflected portion of the debris and shock wave will now be more distant from point A and will therefore exert less pressure than when striking connector plate . Additionally the debris will have already lost momentum to connector and track assembly . Thus the deflected portion of the debris and shock creates a net downward force on vehicle .

From an overall perspective vehicle has a staged progressive use of sacrificial components that attenuate the effect of under vehicle explosions on primary hull and the vehicle crew members. For relatively smaller explosions only the buoyancy panels are damaged or destroyed. For somewhat larger explosions both the buoyancy panels and sub plates of the connector plates would be damaged or destroyed and blast force or blast debris will pass through blast relief ports in a generally horizontal outboard direction. For the largest explosions not only would the buoyancy plates and the aforementioned sub plates be damaged or destroyed but also the connector plates and track assemblies would be blown off the vehicle.

Gussets connector plates track assemblies and cross rods have differing juxtapositions relative to vehicle . In the first juxtaposition as exemplified by the pre blast condition in connector plates are generally vertically oriented and lie in a vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of vehicle . Gussets are oriented such that gusset legs are also generally vertically oriented cross rods are straight as opposed to being bent or twisted under the influence of an explosion from point A. The second configuration is a first post blast condition exemplified by wherein connector plates have begun to tilt outward relative to vehicle and track assemblies tilt with the connector plates. Gussets rotate slightly so as to move with connector plates and cross rods are bent by the movement of gussets . Gussets remain at least partly attached to oblique panels in that anchor elements will not be completely detached from panels even if anchor elements have completely separated from panels . The third configuration is the second post blast condition wherein gussets connector plates track assemblies and cross rods have been blown off vehicle .
