This invention relates to the field of nanotechnology and specifically to an apparatus and method for generating multi wall carbon fullerene nanotube forests and drawing therefrom sheets threads yarns and or films using e.g. various types of adhesion vacuum holding surface tension transport transfer weaving bending densifying and related techniques.

Carbon based materials in general enjoy wide utility due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Recent attention has turned to the use of elongated carbon based structures such as carbon fullerene filaments carbon tubes and in particular nanosized carbon structures. It has been shown that these new structures impart high strength low weight stability flexibility good heat and electrical conductance and a large surface area relative to volume for a variety of applications such as high strength fibers threads yarns fabrics and reinforcement for composites e.g. nanotube reinforced epoxy structures.

Of growing commercial interest is the use of single wall carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen gas especially for hydrogen powered fuel cells. Other applications for carbon fibers and or nanotube materials include catalyst supports materials for manufacturing devices such as a tip for scanning electron microscopes electron field emitters capacitors membranes for filtration devices as well as materials for batteries. In short interest in nanotube technology arises from the very high strength and electrical and thermo conductive properties of individual nanotubes.

Finer than carbon fibers the material with one micron or smaller of diameter is generally called carbon nanotubes and distinguished from the carbon fibers although no clear line can be run between the both types of carbon fibers. By a narrow definition the material of which carbon faces with hexagon meshes are almost parallel to the axis of the tube is called a carbon nanotube and even a variant of the carbon nanotube around which amorphous carbon and metal or its catalyst surrounds is included in the carbon nanotube. Note that with respect to the present invention this narrow definition is applied to the carbon nanotube. 

Usually the narrowly defined carbon nanotubes are further classified into two types carbon nanotubes having a structure with a single hexagon connected carbon mesh in a tube form are called single wall nanotubes hereafter simply referred to as SWNT the carbon nanotubes made of multi layer hexagon connected carbon tubes are called multi wall nanotubes hereafter simply referred to as MWNT . When grown from a substantially flat substantially planar surface e.g. a nanoporous surface coated with an iron oxide catalyst the typical result is MWNTs. When grown in a dense aligned structure the parallel nanotubes somewhat resemble a forest and are referred to generally as a nanotube forest or more specifically as an MWNT forest. The type of carbon nanotubes may be determined by how they are synthesized and the parameters used to some degree but production of purely one type of the carbon nanotubes has not yet been achieved.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 706 entitled Self oriented bundles of carbon nanotubes and method of making same issued May 15 2001 to Hongjai Dai et al. is incorporated herein by reference. Dai et al. describe a method of making bundles of aligned carbon nanotubes e.g. for a field emission device such as a plasma TV screen on a porous surface of a substrate the method comprising the steps of a depositing a catalyst material on the porous surface of the substrate and patterning the catalyst material such that one or more patterned regions are produced and b exposing the catalyst material to a carbon containing gas at an elevated temperature such that one or more bundles of parallel carbon nanotubes grow from the one or more patterned regions in a direction substantially perpendicular to the substrate.

Nanotube forests can be combined together to form structures possessing extreme strength characteristics. These strength characteristics however are limited by impurities in the structures themselves arising during the manufacturing process and or from the design of the structures such that the maximum possible surface to volume ratio is not used by the structure. The present invention addresses these and related issues.

In some embodiments the present invention provides improved apparatus and methods for growing nanotube forests such as carbon fullerene nanotubes arranged in a densely packed aligned configuration synthesized from a catalyst covered substrate . Some embodiments provide apparatus and methods for making and using improved nanotube growth substrates. Some embodiments provide apparatus and methods for making and using reaction chambers having access ports for removing nanotubes during the growth cycle on a continuous or repeated basis. Some embodiments provide apparatus and methods for making and using composite structures from the nanotube films.

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The leading digit s of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component which appears in multiple Figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.

The generation of carbon nanotube fibers is an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention and can be achieved using known techniques such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 706 the Dai et al. patent incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The Dai et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 706 discloses a method of making carbon nanotube bundles attached to substrates.

Some embodiments apply a modification of a method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 706 in order to make large areas of aligned and closely packed carbon nanotubes across substantially the entire top surface of a solid silicon substrate in a first step A in some embodiments a highly P doped n type silicon substrate 100 oriented crystal top surface resistivity 0.008 0.018 Ohm cm is electrochemically etched in 1 1 HF 49 in water ethanol with an anodization current density of 10 mA cm typical etching time is 5 minutes . This forms a thin nanoporous layer pore size about 3 nanometers on top of a microporous layer pore size about 100 nanometers . Next in a step B in some embodiments the top of the porous layer is covered substantially in its entirety unlike Dai et al. with a five nanometer thick iron Fe film by e beam evaporation. In some embodiments after deposition of iron the substrate is annealed in air at 300 degrees C. overnight. This annealing step oxidizes the surface of the silicon as well as the iron converting the iron patterns into catalytically active iron oxide. The resulting silicon dioxide layer formed on the underlying porous silicon prevents the porous structure of layers from collapsing during the following high temperature chemical vapor deposition CVD step.

Next in a step C in some embodiments the substrate is placed in a tube reactor housed in a tube furnace. The furnace is preheated to 700 degrees C. or 680 degrees C. in a flowing inert gas such as argon or helium . Then at 700 degrees C. or 680 degrees C. the argon or helium supply is turned off and ethylene is flown through the tube reactor at a rate of 1000 sccm min for 15 60 minutes or a mixture of 5 mol acetylene in a Helium carrier is flown through the tube reactor at a rate of 850 sccm min for about 10 minutes . The boat for the substrate s is sealed at one end and the sealed end is placed downstream in the furnace. While ethylene is flowing the iron oxide surface catalyzes the growth of carbon nanotubes which grow perpendicular to the substrate. In some embodiments the iron film is patterned e.g. by deposition through a shadow mask . If the iron is patterned e.g. into islands or strips the width of the bundles is the same as the width of the iron oxide patterns. Accordingly the width of the bundles can be tailored to a specific width depending upon the iron oxide patterns used in forming the bundles.

Other embodiments use methods to generate carbon nanotube fibers such as those described in an article by Zhang Atkinson Baughman titled Multifunctional Carbon Nanotube Yarns by Downsizing an Ancient Technology Vol. 306 Nov. 19 2004 at 1358 1361 the Zhang et al. 2004 article which is incorporated herein by reference . Zhang et al. 2004 give credit to and build on important advances of the Dai group S. Fan et al. Self Oriented Regular Arrays of Carbon Nanotubes and Their Field Emission Properties 283 512 1999 and the Ren group Z. F. Ren et al. Science 282 1105 1998 . Zhang et al. 2004 disclose a method of manufacturing an aligned nanotube forest whereby MWNTs for example are synthesized in a quartz tube 45 mm in diameter by atmospheric pressure CVD of 5 mol CHin He at 680 degrees C. at a flow rate of 580 sccm for 10 minutes. In some embodiments the nanotube forest is grown on an iron Fe film 5 nm thick which in turn is deposited on a silicon Si wafer substrate by electron beam evaporator. Using this method various yarns composed of carbon nanotube fibers were generated by Zhang et al. 2004 with a purity of between 96 to 98 and 2 to 4 Fe and amorphous carbon.

Additionally discussed in Zhang et al. 2004 is a method by which various yarns are generated using the fibers created from a MWNT forest wherein these fibers are twisted together to approximately 80 000 turns meter such that once the ends of the twisted fibers are released the twisted structure is retained. According to Zhang et al. 2004 this twisted structure is retained in part because of the very high surface to volume ratio between the MWNTs.

The generation of carbon nanotube forests is a component of some embodiments of the present invention and can be achieved either using the new techniques described herein or by known techniques such as those described in an article titled Strong Transparent Multifunctional Carbon Nanotube Sheet Vol. 309 Aug. 19 2005 at 1215 1219 the Zhang et al. 2005 article which is incorporated herein by reference .

Zhang et al. 2005 mention a method of manufacturing a MWNT forest based upon the techniques as described above by Zhang et al. 2004 and apply these techniques to the manufacture of MWNT sheets. In manufacturing such sheets a MWNT forest is generated applying the techniques of Zhang et al. 2004. The techniques of Dai et al. could also be applied to generate such forests. Zhang et al. 2005 draw MWNT sheets from the MWNT forest using an adhesive strip e.g. a 3M Post It Note to contact the MWNTs and draw a sheet therefrom. In some embodiments a 1 cm length of 245 micron high i.e. about 0.25 mm forest converts to about a 3 m long a 300 1 ratio strip of freestanding MWNT sheet. Once drawn these sheets can be stacked one on top of another for increased strength set in an overlay or crossed film pattern.

Moreover Zhang et al. 2005 describe a process of densifying these MWNT sheets whereby the sheets are placed attached onto a planar substrate composed of glass gold silicon aluminum steel plastic or some other substrate known in the art. The process includes immersing the substrate and attached MWNT sheet vertically into a bath of a liquid such as ethanol and then retracting the substrate vertically from the liquid and drying. The thinning and surface tension of the liquid evaporating shrinks the thickness of the MWNT sheet thus making the carbon nanotube sheets themselves denser. Some embodiments of the invention use improved methods for applying and evaporating a densifying liquid on a continuous basis to a web moving in a continuous or roll to roll manner.

Some embodiments of the present invention use improved MWNT forest growing techniques to make carbon nanotubes the methods modified from those described in the above mentioned published articles and U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 706. Other embodiments of the present invention use improvements of methods such as described in U.S. Patent Application US 2004 0062708A1 published Apr. 1 2004 by Remskar et al in order to make nanotubes from materials other than carbon for example synthesis and self assembly of single wall subnanometer diameter molybdenum disulfide tubes. In some embodiments the nanotubes contain interstitial iodine which is removed as the molybdenum disulfide nanotube forest is pulled into molybdenum disulphide nanotube films. In some embodiments synthesis is performed using a catalyzed transport reaction similar to that described by Remskar including C60 as a growth promoter. In contrast to Remskar et al. the present invention in some embodiments uses modifications and new techniques similar to those described below but using a quartz substrate for the molybdenum disulfide nanotube growth surface.

Other embodiments substitute a film holding bar and or similar structures for the other adhesive surfaces described herein having a liquid such as ethanol or other alcohol such as poly vinyl alcohol water and or oil selected for its ability to hold nanotube film in place rather than or in addition to adhesive this optionally applies to all embodiments described herein . Still other embodiments substitute a vacuum film holding bar as described below in to hold nanotube film in place rather than or in addition to adhesive this optionally applies to all embodiments described herein .

Once a nanotube structure of a suitable thickness is created each stack of adhesive strips and is turned or bent to an angle of ninety 90 degrees to the nanotube structure such that it is perpendicular to the length of the nanotube structure in a direction opposite that of the other end. In some embodiments the angle to which both the stack of adhesive strips and substrate are bent is greater than ninety 90 degrees. The optimum angles can be determined through empirical testing or modeling. Thus in some embodiments the stacks of adhesive strips and are bent to ninety degree angles to the film stack in directions opposite from one another and perpendicular to the nanotube structure .

In some embodiments as a result of bending the first and second stacks of adhesive strips such that their ends are coplanar the layered nanotube structure will be condensed thinned and flattened and the strength of the nanotube structure will be increased due in part to very high surface to volume ratio between the various layers of single nanotubes i.e. by the nanotubes of the parallel layers sticking to one another across greater surface areas . Specifically a greater portion of the surface area of a single nanotube will come into contact with the a greater portion of the surface area of a second single nanotube and the second nanotube sheet will come into contact with a third and so on and so on resulting in a very strong layered and flattened nanotube structure.

In at least one embodiment a series of layered and flattened nanotube structures e.g. created using the method described above is used to form a further nanotube structure in a cross hatch pattern as described in below. In some embodiments the above described layered and flattened nanotube structures are used to form a nanotube structure in a cross layer pattern. In some embodiments a parallel oriented layered nanotube structure is created. A plurality of these layered nanotube structures is then placed into a cross hatch cross layer woven or some other pattern. Once placed into one of these patterns the adhesive strip stack and substrates are folded to densify the nanotube structure in the above described manner. The result of this bending is that these nanotube structures that make up the above described patterns are flattened and densified and hence stronger than they would otherwise be.

In some embodiments a small amount of forest and a small film tail may remain unused and may be removed and recycled as ordinary carbon nanotube material. Once the remaining forest is removed from substrate additional carbon nanotube forest can be re grown from catalyst surface which in some embodiments may or may not be porous. It is believed that when a nanotube is grown from a catalyst covered porous surface such as described herein each MWNT grows from its base at or near the iron oxide catalyst. It is believed that when a nanotube film is pulled from a nanotube forest the MWNTs break at or near the iron oxide catalyst where the molecular bonds are perhaps not as strong and or not aligned as they are elsewhere in each MWNT . This would typically leave most or all of the catalyst attached to the growth surface available to catalyze further growth if the substrate is again placed in a growth furnace and supplied with carbon bearing source gas.

In some embodiments members and or use a liquid coating such as ethanol or water or oil or other suitable chemical or mixture rather than an adhesive coating to hold carbon nanotube film e.g. by surface tension .

For the various embodiments described herein any of the described film holding members including those that operate by vacuum see or surface tension of a liquid to hold the carbon nanotube film to a surface those that clamp the film between two surfaces see as well as those members having an adhesive surface can be substituted for one or more of the film holders called adhesive members.

In other embodiments threads such as nanotube threads such as described in or previously woven nanotube structures such as web of or a densified stack of parallel films such as in are substituted for the nanotube films of D or E. That is in some embodiments nanotube threads are woven by attaching in some embodiments adhesively or in other embodiments with a vacuum warp threads to a cloth bar such as conveyor belt at one end the far end and to a loom rod at the other end the near end the loom rod being a member of one of a plurality of loom rod sets. Wefts are inserted between the alternate up and down movements of the warps and attached at their ends to holders and see or holders to holders and see to achieve the desired weave. When in an embodiment such as a warp thread or film is finished all the wefts to be woven with that warp have been woven the near end of that warp is attached to belt and a new warp thread or film is attached from belt to a warp loom rod e.g. the rightmost rod in at the other side of the warps. In this way the wefts are sequentially placed parallel to one another and attached at a first diagonal angle between adhesive belt at their near end and adhesive belt at their far end and woven with the warps which are sequentially placed parallel to one another and attached at a second diagonal angle between adhesive belt at their far end at the start of their weaving and adhesive belt at their near end at the finish of their weaving.

In some embodiments a forest merging press arm such as described below for is selectively moved when needed to press together the forest portions across a gap . This can be used to press across small gaps within a nanotube forest such as can occur due to defects in the catalyst surface or other reasons. This pressure or contact between forest portions allows for the continuous or gap free collection of the nanotube film even if there is a slight gap due catalyst defects flow through defects or growing conditions in the nanotube forests .

In some embodiments the present invention provides substantially continuous growth and harvesting of carbon nanotube forests on one or more synthesis substrates within a carbon nanotube forest farm chamber. In some embodiments each synthesis substrate is reused for a plurality of growth cycles wherein the substrate having one or more catalyst covered faces is placed in a reaction chamber in a furnace e.g. in some embodiments operating at about 680 degrees C. and a carbon bearing precursor or reactant gas e.g. in some embodiments 5 mol acetylene in a Helium carrier is provided to the vicinity of the catalyst covered face s . In some embodiments an interior flow synthesis substrate is used wherein the reactant gas is supplied through a face opposite the growth surface called a flow through substrate see e.g. B or K or through a side face called a side flow substrate see e.g. or F . In some embodiments a nanotube film is pulled directly from the nanotube forest through an access port e.g. into the reaction chamber e.g. while the substrate remains in the furnace e.g. . In some embodiments the forest and substrate remain at about the growth temperature e.g. 680 degrees C. while nanotube film is pulled while in other embodiments the forest and substrate are cooled at least somewhat before nanotube film is pulled e.g. in various of the embodiments to about 650 C. or higher to about 625 C. or higher to about 600 C. or higher to about 575 C. or higher to about 550 C. or higher to about 525 C. or higher to about 500 C. or higher to about 475 C. or higher to about 450 C. or higher to about 425 C. or higher to about 400 C. or higher to about 375 C. or higher to about 350 C. or higher to about 325 C. or higher to about 300 C. or higher to about 275 C. or higher to about 250 C. or higher to about 225 C. or higher to about 200 C. or higher to about 175 C. or higher to about 150 C. or higher to about 125 C. or higher to about 100 C. or higher to about 75 C. or higher or to about 50 C. or higher while in yet other embodiments the forest and substrate are cooled to about room temperature before nanotube film is pulled. In other embodiments a substrate and its nanotube forest are withdrawn through access port e.g. from reaction chamber e.g. while one or more other substrates remain in the reaction chamber at about the growth temperature e.g. 680 degrees C. . The methods of the present invention thus allow continuous or substantially continuous growth and harvesting of nanotube forests .

In some embodiments it is undesirable to have a direct sideways flow of gasses across the growing nanotube forest . The reaction chamber with its closed upwind end and its open downwind end allows reaction gasses to readily diffuse into the growth zone while preventing a direct breeze. In some embodiments a gas pressure is maintained at access port to also suppress any flow of gas through the access port. In some embodiments an inverted U shaped heat trap is placed in the path of the access port .

In some embodiments the source reactant gas includes acetylene in a helium carrier and the exhaust or output gas includes some of the acetylene the helium carrier and waste byproducts of the nanotube synthesis reaction such as hydrogen gas and or other hydrocarbons. In some embodiments the exhaust gasses are recycled e.g. by compressing and separating the gasses then remixing the recovered acetylene and helium carrier adding supplemental new gasses as needed and using the result as input reactant gas .

In some embodiments at least one substrate of the plurality of substrates in linked substrate loop is a flow through nanoporous substrate such as described in or . In other embodiments a conventional non flow through substrate is used such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 706 or the articles listed above as Zhang et al. 2004 or Zhang et al. 2005. In yet other embodiments non porous substrates such as rough or smooth textured silicon wafers are used.

In some embodiments the input reactant gas passes through distribution baffles and then through one or more side by side flow through linked substrates that are located within the reaction chamber of the furnace . In some embodiments reaction chamber forms or is moveable to form a fairly tight seal around the bottom of the substrates in the reaction chamber e.g. and in the embodiment shown in order to force the gas through the flow through substrate s or into the sides of a side flow substrate in other embodiments . By providing a flow through substrate reactant gas reaches all parts of the growing forest such that nanotubes near the edges grow at about the same rate as nanotubes on the center of the forest thus avoiding forests with concave tops that grow that way because they do not have sufficient gas reaching the center of the forest due to blockage from the nanotubes around the edge. The input reactant gas upon reaching the top of substrate contacts a catalyst covered growth surface on the flow through linked substrate . Contact of the input reactant gas with the catalyst on growth surface of a substrate in the linked substrate loop provides for the synthesis of nanotube forests within a reaction chamber that is positioned within the furnace . It is believed that growth occurs at the bottom of each nanotube i.e. next to the catalyst . The exhaust or output gas then exits the furnace through an exhaust outlet .

The nanotube forests are shown as having a leading edge a trailing edge a top and a bottom . The linked substrate loop includes individual substrates that are linked by substrate connectors . The linked substrate loop forms a continuous loop that can be intermittently or continuously advanced. As the loop is advanced the individual linked flow through substrates pass through a preheat furnace that is included within the furnace enter into a reaction chamber where synthesis of nanotube forest occurs exit the reaction chamber through an access port in the side of the furnace pass through a cooling jacket have their nanotube forests harvested and then reenter the furnace through another access port after their forests have been harvested.

In some embodiments linked substrate loop forms a continuous loop that can be continuously advanced or in other embodiments the loop is advanced for example by the length of the center to center distance between substrates and then substantially stopped for a period of time. For example in the embodiment shown three substrates are in growth chamber at any one time and each substrate after entering reaction chamber spends one third of its growth time in the position of substrate the next one third of its growth time in the position of substrate and the last one third of its growth time in the position of substrate e.g. in some embodiments about 200 seconds in each station for a total of ten minutes . In some embodiments the substrates are cooled at least somewhat by resting in cooling jacket while subsequent substrates grow their nanotube forests in reaction chamber .

In some embodiments after an individual substrate passes through the cooling jacket the leading edge of the nanotube forest grown on a leading i.e. an initial individual substrate is contacted with a pulling bar . The pulling bar which in some embodiments has an adhesive front surface such as shown in a vacuum front surface as shown in or other suitable film pull starting mechanism pulls the leading edge of nanotube forest from substrate to form a nanotube film . In some embodiments the nanotube film is attached to be wound around rotating take up reel . The pulling bar is then retracted and the take up reel turns in direction to continuously pull and take up the nanotube film from the individual linked substrate and form nanotube film spool .

In some embodiments when the continuous closed loop of linked substrate loop is advanced or advanced and then stopped the portion of continuous loop immediately next to the film pull i.e. substrate which has the nanotube forest that is currently being harvested into film and substrate that has the nanotube forest that will next be harvested is bent inward to form a folded junction where the trailing edge see of the preceding nanotube forest on substrate is placed into contact with the leading edge of the following nanotube forest on substrate .

In some embodiments at least one linked substrate in linked substrate loop is a flow through nanoporous substrate such as described in or . In other embodiments a conventional non flow through substrate is used such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 706 or the articles listed above as Zhang et al. 2004 or Zhang et al. 2005. In yet other embodiments non porous substrates such as rough or smooth textured silicon wafers are used.

In some embodiments linked substrate loop forms a continuous loop that can be continuously advanced or in other embodiments the loop is advanced for example by the length of one linked substrate and then substantially stopped for a period of time. For example in the embodiment shown three substrates are in growth chamber at any one time and the substrates stop for a period of time e.g. one third of the nanotube growth time in each position around the loop then move one substrate length i.e. by the center to center distance between linked substrates to the next position and again stop. In other embodiments a slow continuous movement is used that moves the loop at a rate approximately equal to the rate of harvest at the front nanotube forest .

In some embodiments the already harvested linked substrates re enter furnace and pass through an optional heat trap which suppresses convective heat flow. As the linked substrate loop is advanced the individual linked flow through substrates pass through a preheat furnace that is included within the furnace enter into reaction chamber where synthesis lengthwise growth of nanotube forest occurs exit the reaction chamber through a first access port in the side of furnace pass through a cooling jacket pass through a second cooling jacket and then reenter the furnace through another access port . After an individual substrate passes through the cooling jacket the leading edge of the nanotube forest grown on the individual substrate is contacted with a pulling bar . The pulling bar pulls the nanotube forest to form a nanotube film . The nanotube film is attached to and wound by a take up reel . The pulling bar is then retracted and the take up reel turns to continuously take up the nanotube film from the individual substrate . As the continuous loop of linked substrates is advanced the continuous loop forms a folded junction where the trailing edge of the preceding nanotube forest on substrate is placed into contact with the leading edge of the following nanotube forest on substrate . In addition in some embodiments the nanotube forest grown on preceding linked substrate is pressed into the leading edge of a nanotube forest growing on the following linked substrate by a forest merging press arm which is selectively moved when needed to press the two forests together. This can be at the junction between different nanotube forests on separate substrates and as shown but in some embodiments can also be used to press across small gaps within a nanotube forest such as can occur due to defects in the catalyst surface or other reasons. This pressure or contact between forests allows for the continuous collection of the nanotube film from the separate substrates of the advancing continuous loop even if there is a slight gap due to spacing between substrates and or growing conditions at the edges of the substrates.

Also illustrated is an input gas inlet positioned next to the take up reel in some embodiments and through which gas e.g. an inert gas such as helium or argon or other gas that does not detrimentally react with the warm or hot nanotube forests can flow to maintain a slight positive gas pressure that acts to exclude oxygen from the cool chamber of the invention during collection of nanotube film .

In some embodiments the outer surface of the starting material is formed or machined to a substantially smooth outer surface in the shape of a cylinder. In other embodiments the shape of a truncated cone or other solid prism shape is used. In some embodiments this outer layer s surface is covered with a CVD deposited layer of polysilicon which is then treated with an anodic etch in ethanol and hydrofluoric acid to create a nanoporous surface as described above for silicon wafers and then covered with a 5 nanometer for example layer of iron that is then oxidized to form the nanotube catalyst. This forms a flow through substrate cylinder . Other embodiments use other materials to create cylinders that may be but need not be flow through that will operate at the high temperatures e.g. 680 to 700 degrees centigrade in some embodiments . In some embodiments that use a porous material for cylinder substrate the slightly pressurized input reactant gas passes or permeates through the substantially cylindrical porous substrate and contacts a catalyst covered growth surface located on the outside of substantially cylindrical substrate . Interaction of the input reactant gas with the catalyst covered growth surface of cylindrical substrate provides for the synthesis of a radially aligned densely packed continuous nanotube forest on the catalyst covered growth surface . This synthesis occurs within a reaction region that is located within furnace . In some embodiments no reaction chamber enclosure is used since the nanotube forest is continuously grown in a radial direction as cylinder rotates and the nanotube film is harvested continuously from front face of forest while still at the reaction temperature e.g. 680 to 700 degrees centigrade in some embodiments .

The nanotube forest is shown as having a leading edge new growth nanotube forest a top distal from growth surface of cylinder and a bottom adjacent to growth surface of cylinder . The exhaust or output gas then exits the furnace through an exhaust outlet . In some embodiments a leading edge of the nanotube forest is initially contacted with a pulling bar that then withdraws from nanotube forest to form and pull nanotube film . In some embodiments nanotube film is attached to a take up reel . The pulling bar is then retracted and the take up reel turns in direction to continuously collect the nanotube film from cylindrical substrate . In some embodiments cylindrical substrate is very slowly turned as the nanotube film is collected from the substrate to provide for continuous collection of the nanotube film . In some embodiments an optical sensor is connected to a servo motor used to rotate cylindrical substrate in order to keep front edge of nanotube forest at an optimal position or angle for pulling the nanotube forest . In some embodiments nanotube film passes through a side access port in furnace and through cooling jacket into cool chamber before it is collected on the take up reel positioned within cooling box . In some embodiments cooling box includes a positive pressure gas inlet that provides for entry of gas to maintain a positive pressure within the cooling box that acts to exclude oxygen or other potential contaminants from the cooling box . Also illustrated are insulation walls .

In some embodiments adhesive strips and or adhesive coated rods are used in conjunction to create a layered and flattened nanotube structure. In such an embodiment an adhesive strip of an appropriate width is used to draw a nanotube sheet. Once drawn with the adhesive strip the end of the nanotube sheet to which the adhesive strip is attached is in turn attached to a second adhesive coated rod and the adhesive strip is removed. This nanotube sheet is attached by folding the end of the nanotube sheet over the second rod such that the rod is connected to the nanotube sheet. In some embodiments these adhesive coated rods are 1 to 2 mm in diameter and of some suitable length corresponding to the width of the nanotube forest bearing substrate. In some of the various embodiments these rods are made from steel iron aluminum plastic rubber rubber coated steel cable or some other suitable material.

In some embodiments once the second adhesive coated rod is employed a first adhesive coated rod is placed at the first end of the nanotube sheet. The first and second adhesive coated rods are used in combination to manipulate an individual nanotube sheet. In some embodiments the first and second adhesive coated rods are used to manipulate and or transfer a nanotube sheet to a second set of rods comprising a third and fourth adhesive coated rods. Using the adhesive strips and the first and second adhesive coated rods to transfer a nanotube sheet a layered nanotube structure can be built up whereby the process of generating nanotube sheets is repeated as is the transfer of these sheets from the adhesive strip holder to the first and second rods and finally to the third and fourth rods. Specifically several nanotube sheets are layered one on top of another with the ends of the nanotube sheets attached to the adhesive coated third and fourth rods.

In at least one embodiment once a nanotube structure of a suitable thickness is created through the layering of the nanotube sheets the third and fourth adhesive coated rods are rotated in opposite directions i.e. one in a clockwise and another in a counter clockwise direction to flatten the layers that comprise the nanotube structure.

In some embodiments once a series of nanotube structures are created they are combined to generate a cross hatch or cross layer pattern. These cross hatch or cross layer patterns and the size of the nanotube structures generated in a cross match or cross layer pattern are only limited by the number of the nanotube structures used. Once the requisite cross hatch or cross layer patterns is formed the third and fourth adhesive rods used to manipulate each individual nanotube structure are removed leaving a complete nanotube structure formed in a cross layer or cross hatch pattern.

The process of generating a structure or fabric using a loom is well known. U.S. Pat. No. 169 by Erastus B. Bigelow issued Apr. 20 1837 which is incorporated herein in its entirety describes a power loom for weaving coach lace and other similar fabrics. Common to most looms is the use of warp threads weft threads and a space between the warp threads called a shed. Typically the process of weaving fabrics using a loom includes alternately raising and lowering a series of warp threads oriented to each other in a generally parallel manner such that one set of parallel warp threads would be raised and an adjacent set of parallel warp threads would be lowered. In some embodiments each thread of the second set is located between two threads of the first set. Between each alternate raising and lowering of these sets of warp threads a weft thread is passed through the space or shed between the sets of warp threads. Looms automate this process of raising lowering and the passing through of weft threads to create fabrics.

In at least one embodiment modifications of traditional weaving techniques utilizing a loom such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 169 are used to form a single nanotube structure consisting of multiple smaller structures of nanotubes. In such an embodiment a set A of layered condensed nanotube structures are attached to a loom. A second set B of layered condensed nanotube structures is also attached to a loom. Collectively set A and set B are referred to as warp films and individually as a warp film. In some embodiments set A and set B are spread out in a horizontal array i.e. a horizontal loom while in other embodiments a vertical array i.e. a vertical loom is used. In some embodiments the distance or shed between the outer most A and B warp films is greater than the distance between other warp films in the set A or B as attached to a loom such as described in . In some embodiments the shed is the same between all warp film sets as described in . In some embodiments when a loom containing sets A and B is operated the nanotube structures of set B are placed in an up position while the nanotube structures of set A are placed in a down position. Once the loom is operated to place a weft structure the positions of sets A and B alternate. While sets A and B alternate a series of additional nanotube structures serve as wefts and are passed into the shed existing between the members of set A and set B. These wefts are thus in effect woven into the warps forming set A and B. In some embodiments the wefts are shifted toward the point at which the warp sets are attached so as to strengthen the woven nanotube structure. Once this process is competed a woven nanotube structure is created.

In some embodiments a combination of adhesive coated rods and rollers are utilized to draw nanotube sheets from one or more nanotube forests attached to one or more substrates. In some embodiments the substrate is formed from a glass silicon Si or sapphire and in some embodiments is between 1 and 50 cm wide or wider. In some embodiments the substrate has a porous surface wherein in some embodiments the surface pores are about 10 nanometers or smaller across. In some embodiments the height of the forest of nanotubes is grown to approximately 0.25 mm. This height can be varied based upon the process used to form the nanotube fibers as is described above. In one embodiment one or more nanotube sheets are drawn pulled together to form multiple layers and flattened using a series of rollers. Once flattened in some embodiments a PVA poly vinyl alcohol solution or some other suitable solution is sprayed onto the newly formed nanotube structure in order to densify the structure. Specifically the effect of the liquid evaporating is to shrink the nanotube sheet thus making the sheets themselves denser. In some embodiments a PVA poly vinyl alcohol ethanol or some other suitable liquid bath is used whereby the nanotube structure is passed through the bath to allow for the nanotube structure to densify. After being passed through the bath the nanotube structure is passed around a rotating drum allowed to dry and accumulated in a roll. In some embodiments strips of the nanotube structure are cut at a predetermined length and spliced together to form a long continuous piece of layered flattened nanotube film.
