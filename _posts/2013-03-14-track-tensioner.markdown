title: Track tensioner
abstract: The track tension of a tracked vehicle is actively controlled by a track tensioner system that is positioned behind or within an idler wheel of a tracked vehicle. The system employs no exposed hydraulic line and is operable to default to a passive tensioning mode in the event of a system failure. The hydraulic circuit of the track tensioner system is powered by the rotation of the idler wheel inside which the system resides.

This invention was made with Government support under Department of Defense Army TACOM Contract W56 HZV 09 C 0041 SBIR Phase 2 Advanced Electromechanical Track Tensioner. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to active or dynamic systems for track tensioning on a tracked vehicle and methods related thereto. More particularly the present invention relates to hydraulically actuated active track tensioners and related methods for adjusting a track tension.

Tracked vehicles such as military vehicles have been in use for nearly a century. Track tension of such vehicles must be maintained at the proper level throughout operation over various terrain profiles in order to keep the track from sliding off the sprocket during a sudden maneuver or turn as well as to prevent excessive load from being applied to the tracks the vehicle drive train and the vehicle suspension. Additionally track tension has a large impact on power efficiency as an over tightened or tensioned track can lead to power loss from excess friction and accelerated wear of the track system.

Track tension is typically controlled by moving a sprocket or idler wheel that engages the track. A conventional passive mechanism for moving the sprocket or idler wheel is a track tensioner employing a grease filled cylinder. A piston in the cylinder moves as grease is added or removed through a fitting. The piston s motion functions in turn to move the sprocket or idler wheel relative to the track thereby causing the sprocket or idler wheel to either extend into the track path and increase the tension of the track or to withdraw from the path of the track and decrease the tension of the track.

Often a maintenance crew will adjust such a passive track tension on a vehicle to the highest level the system might need until the next maintenance opportunity after a mission or project regardless of whether the resulting track tension is appropriate for optimal fuel economy vehicle mobility or track component service life. The crew will simply tighten the track until it does not fall off during dynamic vehicle use.

Track tensioning systems have also been developed which have the ability to adjust track tension during vehicle operation and in certain designs in response to changing terrain. However these prior art systems are expensive and require extensive vehicle modification in order to be retroactively fitted to a vehicle. Furthermore these known track tensioners increase the vulnerability of the vehicle to breakdown due to the addition of exposed hydraulic lines outside of the vehicle armor protection. Hence these track tensioners tend to also increase vehicle maintenance requirements. These problems have resulted in the relatively limited use of such systems on current tracked vehicles.

What is needed in the art is a dynamic or active track tensioner that is easily and economically installed on new and existing vehicles and that does not result in increased vehicle vulnerability and maintenance.

The present invention provides a dynamic or active track tensioner that is easily and economically installed on new and existing vehicles and that does not result in increased vehicle vulnerability and maintenance. These objectives are achieved in part by certain embodiments of the present track tensioner comprising an actuator a valve a fluid pump in fluid communication with the actuator a fluid tank in fluid communication with the actuator and an accumulator in fluid communication with the actuator. The fluid pump the fluid tank and the accumulator being positioned within or behind an idler wheel.

These objectives are also achieved in part by certain embodiments of the present track tensioner comprising an actuator a fluid pump in fluid communication with the actuator through a pump flow path a fluid tank in fluid communication with the actuator through a tank return flow path an accumulator in fluid communication with the actuator through an accumulator flow path and a manifold through which at least the actuator flow path the tank return flow path and the accumulator flow path are formed.

These objectives are also achieved in part by certain embodiments of the present track tensioner by a method including the steps of determining a desired tension of the track on the track vehicle generating a fluid pressure through the rotation of an idler wheel on said tracked vehicle increasing the tension of the track of the tracked vehicle by extension of the idler wheel with said fluid pressure and decreasing a tension of the track of the tracked vehicle by retraction of the idler wheel through a release of said fluid pressure

Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. The terminology used in the detailed description of the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings is not intended to be limiting of the invention. In the drawings like numbers refer to like elements.

Broadly speaking the track tensioner of the present invention is a self contained active track tensioning system that is configured in part to replace an existing passive track tensioning system of a vehicle with minimal vehicle modifications required and minimal associated costs. The components of the present track tensioner with the exception of at least a portion of the actuator are all contained within the idler wheel of the tracked vehicle as shown in . The present track tensioner employs no exposed hydraulic lines thereby resulting in a robust damage tolerant system which is easily adapted to a wide range of tracked vehicles.

An external control system actively or automatically controls the position of the idler wheel and thus a tension of the track . For example the control system may control the position of the idler wheel by monitoring in part the suspension travel of the vehicle s road wheels and or the power demands of the vehicle s powertrain. Furthermore the track tensioning system of the present invention may employ a manual controller that provides a drive command to the idler wheel for manually establishing for example a high and or a low tension or the track .

Power for operation of the track tensioner of the present invention is obtained from the rotation of the idler wheel within which the present track tensioner is housed and protected. Power for the track tensioner of the present invention is extracted from the moving track of the tracked vehicle i.e. the track of the tracked vehicle functions as a drive belt for the track tensioner. Hence the present track tensioner advantageously does not require that the power for the track tensioner be moved from one position in the vehicle to another by for example employing hydraulic lines or electrical cables. Furthermore the inertia of the vehicle serves to smooth out the power draw required by the track tensioner.

The track tensioner of the present invention employs a system of hydraulic valves that in event of failure of the hydraulic supply is configured to isolate the track tensioner actuator thereby converting the present track tensioner from an active tensioner mode to a passive tensioner mode. Accordingly the present active track tensioner is advantageously configured to provide a default or backup passive tensioning mode in the event of damage or malfunction of the system.

A track tensioner according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to . is a diagram of a hydraulic circuit of an active track tensioner according to one embodiment of the present invention. The active track tensioner employs a hydraulic pump that is in fluid communication with an actuator and a fluid tank via a pump flow path and an actuator flow path . Positioned within the actuator flow path is an actuator control valve . The hydraulic fluid tank is in fluid communication with the actuator via a tank return flow path . Positioned within tank return flow path is an unload valve . An accumulator is also in fluid communication with the actuator via an accumulator flow path . Positioned within the accumulator flow path is an accumulator valve . The active track tensioner may further employ a pressure relief valve . The pressure relief valve is in fluid communication with the tank return flow path and the pump flow path via a pressure relief flow path .

The track tensioner may further incorporate one or more check valves that serve to maintain pressure in desired portions of the above described circuit and or prevent back flow of fluid through the circuit. For example the accumulator valve may be configured as a check valve within the accumulator flow path . The track tensioner may further incorporate one or more pressure sensors that serve to monitor fluid pressure within various portions of the system.

As shown in the above described components are assembled to one another around a manifold . shows the track tensioner assembled within the idler wheel from a backside view of the idler wheel . shows the track tensioner assembled within the idler wheel from a semi transparent view through the front side of the idler wheel . In certain embodiments the idler wheel is an existing idler wheel from the tracked vehicle . Depending on the configuration of the tracked vehicle s existing idler wheel the existing idler wheel may be employed in the active track tensioner with little or no modification. As shown in the figures all of the components of the active track tensioner with the exception of at least a portion of the actuator are housed within or behind the idler wheel .

As shown in the idler wheel is attached to an idler hub which is rotatably attached to an idler spindle about which the idler wheel and idler hub both rotate. In certain embodiments the idler hub is an existing idler hub employed by the tracked vehicle . Attached to the idler wheel and or the idler hub is a drive gear that rotates with the idler wheel about the idler spindle . Drive gear is attached to the idler wheel so as to rotate about the idler hub with the idler wheel .

The track tensioner manifold is mated to the idler spindle in a fixed non rotational manner such that the manifold does not rotate about the idler spindle with the idler wheel . Alternatively the idler spindle may be integrated into or formed as part of the manifold . Attached to the manifold at a pump interface is the hydraulic pump having a pump drive gear shown in . When the track tensioner is assembled e.g. the hydraulic pump is mounted to the manifold and the manifold is mated to the idler wheel and drive gear the pump drive gear interfaces with the drive gear of the idler wheel . As the idler wheel and drive gear rotate about the idler spindle during movement of the tracked vehicle the drive gear causes the pump drive gear to rotate thereby providing a drive or activation power to the hydraulic pump .

The manifold and thus the idler wheel are attached to the tracked vehicle at a first point via a spindle . One side of the spindle is pivotally or rotatably attached to the manifold at a spindle mount shown in and an opposite side of the spindle is non pivotally attached to the track vehicle . As shown in the spindle mount is off set from the idler hub and thus offset from an axis of rotation of the idler wheel s about the idler hub .

The manifold and thus the idler wheel are attached to the tracked vehicle at a second point via the actuator . A first end of the actuator is attached to an actuator tensioner mount and a second end of the actuator is attached to an actuator hull mount shown in of the tracked vehicle shown in . In certain embodiments the actuator hull mount on the tracked vehicle is an existing and or conventional actuator mount employed in cooperation with a passive track tensioner system.

As shown in the actuator is a telescoping hydraulic actuator that employs an outer cylinder having a chamber and an inner cylinder slideable within the outer cylinder . In operation hydraulic fluid is added or removed from the chamber of the actuator through outlet of the actuator tensioner mount and inlet . As shown in the first end of the actuator forms a banjo like fitting over the actuator tensioner mount thereby allowing for the flow of fluid from the actuator fluid flow path formed within the manifold out the outlet and into the inlet of the actuator . As fluid is added to the chamber the volume of the chamber increases and the inner cylinder is pushed out from the outer cylinder thereby increasing the overall length of the actuator . As fluid is removed from the chamber the volume of the chamber decreases and the inner cylinder retracts into the outer cylinder thereby shortening an overall length of the actuator . Due to the spindle mount being off set form the idler hub when the length of the actuator is changed the position of the idler wheel changes relative to the tracked vehicle thereby allowing for the addition or release of tension of the track passing over the idler wheel .

Central to the operation and configuration of the active track tensioner is the manifold . As described above the track tensioner employs no exposed hydraulic lines that are easily susceptible to damage. As shown in this is achieved by incorporating or integrating at least the accumulator the actuator flow path the accumulator flow path the tank return flow path and the pressure relief flow path into the manifold . In one embodiment the manifold is machined from a single block of metal or other similarly resilient material thereby forming a unitary component. In certain embodiments the manifold is formed of a plurality of blocks of metal or other similarly resilient material and thereafter attached to one another.

As shown in various interfaces are formed upon external surfaces of the manifold in order to facilitate attachment of the various components of the track tensioner to the manifold . The interfaces may for example have the form of cylindrical threaded receiving portions machined into the manifold that are complimentary to male couplings and or to cylindrical threaded protrusions formed on the components intended for attachment to the manifold .

For example a pressure relief valve interface serves for attachment of the pressure relief valve to the pressure relief flow path formed within the manifold . An actuator valve interface serves for attachment of the actuator valve to the actuator flow path formed within the manifold . An accumulator valve interface serves for attachment of the accumulator valve to the accumulator flow path formed within the manifold . An unload valve interface serves for attachment of the unload valve to the tank return flow path formed within the manifold . A pump flow path interface serves for establishing fluid flow from the hydraulic pump into the manifold . In certain embodiments the pump flow path employs a combination of fluid flow paths formed within the manifold and flow paths external of the manifold in order to place the hydraulic pump in fluid communication with the tank and the actuator .

In certain embodiments the track tensioner of the present invention employs for example solenoid controlled poppet type valves proportional type valves and or servo valves for the actuator control valve the accumulator valve and or the unload valve . is a hydraulic circuit diagram of the track tensioner in which solenoid controlled poppet type valves are employed for the actuator control valve accumulator valve and the unload valve . For example the actuator control valve and the accumulator valve may be Parker GS04 08 N.C. poppet valves and the unload valve may be a Parker GS06 18 N.O. poppet valve.

In certain embodiments the track tensioner is configured to employ the pump intermittently in order to refill or recharge the accumulator . Once the accumulator is filled the unload valve opens and the fluid flow from the pump is returned to the tank .

As shown in in place of the actuator control valve described with respect to the track tensioner the track tensioner employs an isolation valve and a servo control valve . For example the isolation valve may be a Sun DKDS XHN 15 gmp and the servo control valve may be a Moog D633 valve. In certain embodiments of the track tensioner the accumulator valve may be used as a check valve. In order to employ the servo control valve with the manifold a valve block shown in is employed. The manifold may be modified to include bolt holes or other forms of structure for attachment of the valve block to the manifold . The valve block is mounted to a surface of the manifold shown in .

The valve block serves to advance at least the actuator flow path the pressure relief path and the accumulator flow path from the manifold to the servo control valve . The extension or advancement of the these flow paths is achieved by formation of the flow paths through the valve block in the same or similar manner in which the flow paths are formed through the manifold . Hence the track tensioner also employs no exposed hydraulic lines thereby resulting in a robust damage tolerant system.

In certain embodiments the track tensioner is configured to employ the pump intermittently in order to refill or recharge the accumulator . Once the accumulator is filled the unload valve opens and the fluid flow from the pump is returned to the tank .

With respect to shows the track tensioner assembled within the idler wheel from a backside view of the idler wheel . is a perspective view of the manifold modified for attachment of the valve block shown in . is a view of the assembled track tensioner from a similar perspective as shown in except that the idler wheel and the actuator are not present. is a view of the assembled track tensioner from an opposite side as shown in without the idler wheel and the actuator attached. Finally is a side view of the track tensioner without the idler wheel and the actuator attached.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the manifold is modified so as to achieve the hydraulic circuit shown in without employing the valve block . In other words in order to facilitate employing the servo control valve and the isolation valve the valve block may be deleted from the system and the flow paths formed within the manifold modified to centrally converge or interface with the servo valve .

The track tensioner provides the advantage of relatively greater control authority to accurately position the actuator during retraction than that achieved by the track tensioner as well as decreased time lag between the commanded actuator positions and the actuator reaching the desired position than that achieved by the track tensioner .

In certain embodiments of the present invention the accumulator employed of the track tensioner is configured to have a volume large enough to store sufficient hydraulic fluid to extend the actuator up to half of the total possible travel of the actuator when the idler wheel is not in motion. For example the accumulator is configured to store a volume of hydraulic fluid that is sufficient to transpose the actuator approximately 2.85 inches of a total possible travel of approximately 5.7 inches. As shown in the accumulator employed in the track tensioner may incorporate a gas exchange valve .

In certain embodiments of the present invention the hydraulic pump of the track tensioner may for example be an off the shelf hydraulic pump having a maximum power consumption of approximately eighty horsepower. So long as the idler wheel is turning the hydraulic pump is operable to produce enough pressure to extend the actuator . The hydraulic pump is configured to produce a maximum pressure at a vehicle speed of approximately 7 miles per hour. The track tensioner may further employ a hydraulic filter for example an ASM filter shown in on a positive pressure or downstream side of the pump . The track tensioner may further employ a pump speed sensor .

In certain embodiments of the track tensioner of the present invention an oil cooler or heat exchanger is employed in the tank return flow path or other portion of the hydraulic flow path in order to improve heat dissipation in the system.

The track tensioner produces a maximum extension force of for example 48 000 pounds however once the actuator reaches a desired position and the actuator valve is in a closed position the track tensioner has a maximum holding load of for example 82 000 pounds. The maximum actuation speed of the track tensioner is for example greater than 17 inches per second.

The operation of the above described track tensioner according to the present invention is managed by a controller shown in . In certain embodiments the controller employs a processor in electrical communication with a digital input output module or board a digital to analog converter and analog to digital converter . As shown in the analog to digital converter is in electrical communication with one or more wheel position sensors idler arm position sensors pressure sensors and or a throttle position sensors . In certain embodiments high performance low profile noncontact rotary angle position sensors are employed for use at the trailing and idler arm pivot points. Such sensors consist of a solid state full encased sensor assembly and an external sensor magnet rated to IP67 environmental protection.

The digital input output module or board may in turn be in electrical communication with a manual retract switch that functions to manually retract the actuator and thereby release tension upon the track of the tracked vehicle . The digital input output module or board may also be in electrical communication with an idler wheel speed sensor the unload valve the accumulator valve and or the actuator valve . Finally the digital to analog converter may be in electrical communication with the proportional solenoid valve when employed in the track tensioner system for example in the track tensioner described above.

The controller may for example employ a processor in the form of an off the shelf UEISIM600 manufactured by United Electronic Industries. An UEISIM600 is based on a PowerPC processor and runs on a standard Linux kernel. The UEISIM600 has 6 slots one of which is filled with an analog to digital converter in the form of a DNA AI 202 analog to digital input board having 12 analog input channels with 16 bit resolution. Another of the slots of the UEISIM600 is filled with a digital to analog converter in the form of an UEI DNA AO 308 420 board having 8 channels of analog current output with 16 bit resolution. A digital input output module or board in the form of an UEI DNA DIO 406 having 12 digital input channels and 12 digital output channels is also attached to the UEISIM600. The above described track tensioner requires only small amounts of electrical power in the order of for example 250 watts at 24 to 30 volts DC.

Control of the active track tensioner of the present invention is based upon four base components or modules each having a differing level of priority. These components listed from highest to lowest priority are 1 a Constant Track Length module 2 a Tension Level Feedforward module 3 a Tension Control Feedback module and 4 a Passive Tension Overload Protection module.

The first module the Constant Track Length module employs data from the wheel position sensors on each of the road wheel trailing arms and the idler arm position sensors of the tracked vehicle to determine the road wheel and idler wheel positions. Based upon these determined positions the Constant Track Length module calculates the desired length of the actuator required to keep the track path length constant based upon the perturbations of the road wheels and idler wheel away from their nominal ride height positions.

The second module the Tension Level Feedforward module calculates the tractive effort forces from the powertrain of the tracked vehicle and determines the desired pressure within the actuator and hence the force developed by the actuator . Without this correction the changes in track tension created by the vehicle drivetrain would cause large fluctuations in the idler wheel position.

For example if the Tension Control Feedback module controls the track tension to 10 000 pounds and a 25 000 pound tractive effort was applied to the track by the drivetrain then absent Feedback correction the track tensioner would move the idler wheel to reduce the track tension until the limit position would be reached. With Tension Level Feedforward the desired track tension command would be increased to 35 000 pounds allowing the 10 000 pound nominal track tension to be maintained at its appropriate set point. In certain embodiments the torque of the sprocket is previously determined and accessible through a look up table with acceleration pedal position transmission ratio and idler wheel speed as inputs.

The third module the Tension Control Feedback module adjusts the position of the idler wheel to compensate for errors in the Constant Track Length module. Such errors arise because the surface profile upon which the tracked vehicle travels is approximated by the road wheel positions and from deviations in the actual track length caused by track component wear and thermal growth. The Tension Control Feedback module measures track tensioning forces applied to the idler wheel with the pressure sensor which monitors the chamber pressure of the actuator . Based on this pressure and the desired position of the idler wheel fluid is either pumped into or released out of the actuator . Depending on the driving conditions the Tension Control Feedback module also serves to control the nominal track tension from low tension for reduced power requirements on smooth hard ground to higher tension for improved mobility over soft terrains and better load sharing between unsupported and supported track sections.

This approach is similar to a central tire inflation system CTIS on wheeled vehicles which allows the tire pressure to be adjusted depending on terrain conditions. Low tire pressures improve mobility with lower tire contact pressures and increased contact patch length at the cost of increased wear heat build up and power consumption due to increased rolling resistance. Higher tire pressures reduce rolling resistance and heat build up but have reduced soft soil mobility.

The fourth module the Passive Tension Overload Protection module is modeled or established as a pressure relief valve on the track tensioner hydraulic circuit. If the pressure within the circuit is too high the pressure relief valve opens thereby dumping fluid into the hydraulic tank and reducing the tensioner force applied through the actuator. This module only operates when the track tension reaches predetermined levels which will damage the track or other parts of the track system such as the actuator . Such high levels of track tension could be caused by debris accumulating between the road wheels the idler wheel the sprocket and or the track or by a failure of all or a portion of the controller .

The above described four control modules together function to provide a robust controller that achieves improved track life high vehicle performance reduced track maintenance and high mobility.

Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and applications one of ordinary skill in the art in light of this teaching can generate additional embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit of or exceeding the scope of the claimed invention. Accordingly it is to be understood that the drawings and descriptions herein are proffered by way of example to facilitate comprehension of the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope thereof.
