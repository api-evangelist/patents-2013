title: Aggregate electronic mail message handling
abstract: Techniques for aggregating one or more electronic mail messages (e.g., a subscribed to email) are described, including receiving at an aggregating domain, electronic mail communicated from another domain, parsing the electronic mail to selectively extract content identifiers for content (e.g., text, images, audio, video, media) included in the electronic mail, generating a tile object from selectively extracted content identifiers, and displaying the tile object on a display grid for viewing by a subscriber (e.g., user) of one or more of the electronic mail messages. A plurality of tiles may be generated for a plurality of different email messages and the display grid may display all or a portion of the plurality of tiles. Electronic mail messages may include a subscription to the aggregating domain that was elected by a user as an option presented by a publisher of a unsubscribe page in response to the user's unsubscribe request.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 13 191 412 filed on Jul. 26 2011 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application relates generally to computer software computer program architecture data and database management professional media social media web based applications and mobile applications. More specifically techniques for electronic mail processing and publication for a visual display oriented email system are described.

Electronic messaging is an important function for garnering data for personal consumption and for sharing data with other individuals organizations or entities. Conventional electronic messaging solutions such as electronic mail hereafter email applications servers and platforms allow users to receive email compose email forward email send email carbon copy cc email blind cc email and reply to email. Moreover reviewing content included in an email often requires several click troughs of a mouse or other user interface device to access the content. For example one click through may be necessary to open an email in a user s inbox or other email folder another click through may be necessary to access a web page site in a hyperlink or image included in a body of the email message. It is estimated that one third of users are lost for each click through required to access email content. From a user point of view an inbox or other email folder may contain an overwhelming amount of visual information created by a large number of email messages from a large number of different email sources such as advertisers businesses financial institutions invoices for bills newsletters social networks professional networks special interests groups friends colleagues and family just to name a few.

In some instances there may be redundant emails from the same source and or there may be emails from sources the user is subscribed to but is no longer interested in receiving. In any case visually parsing through the disparate assembly of email messages and the concomitant click troughs that may be required to access the content of each email may result in the user unsubscribing from an email source or ignoring email from an email source due to the number of required to access content. The unsubscribe requests from users may be regarded as a churn rate that is undesirable for a publisher or other source of the email.

On a weekly basis if a publisher has a 0.3 churn rate then that publisher may lose 5 of its subscribers on an annual basis with a concomitant loss of revenue to the publisher from advertising etc. In many cases the unsubscribing user may actually like the content being provided by the publisher but is compelled to downsize the amount of emails that he she is receiving due to an overwhelming amount of emails being received from many disparate sources and the burden of having to visually sort through and decide which emails to react to or to ignore or delete. For example faced with a large number of emails in an inbox a user may permanently delete emails they regard as less important. As another example a user has subscribed to a source of emails e.g. a newsletter etc. and those emails are received in the user s inbox. The user may actually want to receive the subscribed to emails but doesn t want them in their regular inbox. Due to email overload the user may elect to unsubscribe from the emails even though they initially subscribed to the emails and may actually still want to receive them.

Conventional presentation of email messages using a subject line format may not convey enough useful information to allow a user to decide whether or not to open the email to divine its content. For example an email may include text and images however the user may not see the image portion until at least one or more click troughs and the image portion of the content if known without having to click through may be more informative to the user in making a decision to dive further into the content of an email message or to ignore or delete the email message as opposed to just the text presented in the subject line. In other cases the visual parsing of a folder or inbox may be fatiguing to a user and result in the user overlooking an email of interest because it is not visually prominent and or noticeable when presented among other emails in that folder or inbox.

Thus what is needed is a solution for electronic mail processing and visual presentation to a user that addresses limitations of conventional techniques and or reduce churn rate.

It is to be understood that in the drawings like reference numerals designate like structural elements. Also it is understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale.

Various embodiments or examples may be implemented in numerous ways including as a system a process an apparatus a user interface or a series of program instructions on a non transitory computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network where the program instructions are sent over optical electronic or wireless communication links. In general operations of disclosed processes may be performed in an arbitrary order unless otherwise provided in the claims.

A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the examples has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.

In some examples the described techniques may be implemented as a computer program or application application or as a plug in module or sub component of another application. The described techniques may be implemented as software hardware firmware circuitry or a combination thereof. If implemented as software the described techniques may be implemented using various types of programming development scripting or formatting languages frameworks syntax applications protocols objects or techniques including ASP ASP.net .Net framework Ruby Ruby on Rails C Objective C C C Adobe Integrated Runtime Adobe AIR ActionScript Flex Lingo Java Javascript Ajax Perl COBOL Fortran ADA XML MXML HTML DHTML XHTML HTTP XMPP PHP and others. Design publishing and other types of applications such as Dreamweaver Shockwave Flash Drupal and Fireworks may also be used to implement the described techniques. Database management systems i.e. DBMS search facilities and platforms web crawlers i.e. computer programs that automatically or semi automatically visit index archive or copy content from various websites hereafter referred to as crawlers and other features may be implemented using various types of proprietary or open source technologies including MySQL Oracle from Oracle of Redwood Shores Calif. Solr and Nutch from The Apache Software Foundation of Forest Hill Md. among others and without limitation. The described techniques may be varied and are not limited to the examples or descriptions provided.

Databases in some examples may be directly or indirectly in data communication with server which may be implemented as described above to perform one or more applications deliver services or resources to clients execute or compile applications or otherwise provide any type of processing capability or facility without limitation. Data associated with the techniques described herein may be stored in one or both of databases . In other examples data may also be stored in embedded memory of any type with server or any of clients . Still further data may be stored and retrieved by server or any of clients from any of databases without limitation as to any given database schema or structure. For example an email may be transmitted to a shared destination which may be an email server e.g. server email account or other resource that is configured to accept email messages sent using messaging protocols such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol hereafter SMTP and received using other protocols such as Internet Message Access Protocol hereafter IMAP or Post Office Protocol hereafter POP among others. In some examples email receipt may be indicated automatically or semi automatically to server . In other examples received emails sent to an email account or client may be retrieved periodically based on a set or irregular schedule. For example an application hosted and running on server may be configured to retrieve emails for further processing as described below on a set schedule e.g. every 1 5 30 60 minutes or the like . Using various types of email receipt protocols e.g. IMAP POP or others emails may be retrieved from an email account or shared destination. Once retrieved by server emails may be stored in database and or and processed further to generated processed messages for posting to a shared environment e.g. website . As used herein an email account to which emails are sent for posting in a shared environment may be referred to as a shared destination. 

A shared destination may be in some examples an email account hosted on server that is configured to receive emails sent from various sources and intended for posting to a given website e.g. website . Data associated with emails sent to a shared destination may be stored in database or in other examples remotely stored in database .

As shown here website may be described as a shared environment or facility to which data information or other content may be posted or published. As used herein posting or publication may be used interchangeably and are intended to refer to the format transmission upload design layout and other parameters of content manipulated relative to a given environment e.g. website among others . In some examples website may be a website at which emails attachments data information or other types of content may be viewed retrieved posted or deleted without limitation. In other examples system and the above described elements may be varied in function structure configuration topology quantity type or other aspects and are not limited to the examples shown.

In some examples logic module may be configured to provide command and or control signals instructions and functions to direct one or more of database retrieval module XML engine email processing engine security module and posting module . Logic module for example may direct retrieval module to identify locate and retrieve emails sent to a shared destination e.g. IMAP or POP email account . Logic module may also be configured to process retrieved emails to generate processed messages i.e. retrieved emails that have been processed by email processing engine for posting or publication in a shared environment e.g. website prior to being directed to posting module for posting to the shared environment e.g. website . Further logic module may be configured to evaluate retrieved emails to determine whether a security threat e.g. malicious software hereafter malware spyware i.e. malware intended to passively gather data and information from a host operating system computer or application cross site scripting and others. Security module may be implemented using various types of security software firmware or hardware such as intrusion detection and prevention systems anti virus or others without limitation that are intended to detect whether an email to be processed by email processing engine is a security threat that once posted to a shared environment e.g. website may be accessible and pose a security risk to other clients.

As shown data may be stored in database using any type of database database schema or storage mechanism without limitation including storage area networks hereafter SAN network attached storage hereafter NAS cloud storage or the like. Further retrieved emails may be stored using various types of markup and formatting languages such as XML and others. XML engine is an example of a type of facility or resource that may be used to evaluate format and generate XML formatted data to be stored for example in database or as another example to be processed for posting to a shared environment e.g. website by email processing engine and posting module . In other examples application may be implemented in any type of application environment distributed or otherwise using one or more application servers computers or computing platforms from which to host. Apart from the examples shown and described application and the above described elements may be varied in function structure format language configuration or other aspects and are not limited to any specific implementation.

In some examples the quantity of processed messages may be set to a discrete number per page e.g. 10 per page 100 1000 customizable user specified system specified rules based and others . Further when a user navigates to a given page using for example a web i.e. the World Wide Web hereafter web browsing application processed messages may be sorted based on criteria specified in sort window by using pulldown menu . In this example criteria such as Newest Trending Now Most Popular Today Most Popular Past Week and Most Popular Past Month may be chosen in order to sort processed messages . When selected a criterion may cause processed shared environment to be rendered such that the order is determined based on the selected criteria. In other examples posted emails may be ranked using various techniques and as an example identified using the Trending Now feature. For example posted emails may be ranked based on determining the number of users to which the posted email has been forwarded e.g. if a posted email has been forwarded previously multiple times to an aggregate pool of 20 recipients a quantitative rank may be assigned using various techniques including assigning a weighted or unweighted ranking value based on the number of recipients e.g. in the example above 20 . In other examples rankings may be performed differently using various techniques or algorithms without limitation. As an indicator of activity within a service providing window an activity stream or other type of feed or data stream may be created in which one or more posted emails replies comments votes rankings or other activities occurring may be posted generally for users to view in some contexts such as within corporate enterprises this and other features may be suppressed in order to confine the applicability of the described techniques to prescribed enterprise purposes . In some examples users may opt in and subscribe to an activity stream in order to ensure that those users who do not elect to receive updates as to activity are not receiving unwanted notifications. In other examples processed messages may be sorted or displayed differently and are not limited to those shown and described.

Here processed messages may also be searched using a facility that has an interface such as search field to permit the entry of keywords or other items that may be used to select the appearance of processed messages . A search of processed messages may be used to find email content i.e. content data information media rich media text or the like from a given pool of emails posted to shared environment . When posted emails may be made anonymous i.e. remove identifying information such as email addresses in order to protect user privacy as described in greater detail below in connection with . In some examples each of processed messages may be treated like an individual post that when selected is hyperlinked to another page where related emails of the same topic may be listed as described below in connection with .

Referring back to shared environment can be provided as a destination website e.g. website that enables the entry or submission of email content for various types of purposes e.g. interest humor amusement fun business enterprise corporate collaborative work sharing and others without limitation . Email content may be submitted using shared environment to permit other users to enter comments or submit other emails related to a given topic or original email i.e. threading as indicated by title topic . Each email submitted may be processed by email processing engine to be generated into a processed message and posted as part of a thread.

In other examples users can view emails associated with topics of various types of interests. Within a corporate organization or enterprise including for profit non profit governmental organizations emails may be submitted for collective sharing and collaborative input by other members of the same organization. Likewise security module may be configured to provide additional security to permit authenticated use by members of a given organization as opposed to enabling shared environment to be publicly accessible. Generally shared environment may be used as a forum for the sharing of email content that does not require the manual formatting of email content for posting. In other words a user having an account recorded in one or both of databases may forward or send emails to a service hosted by server which may be processed by email processing engine as described in greater detail below in connection with and posted to shared environment . Once made available to a community e.g. public closed non public corporate enterprise and the like of users other emails may be posted directly to shared environment .

Additionally sitemap link may be used to hyperlink i.e. linking i.e. pointing a web browsing application to another address and retrieving and displaying content from that location to another page of website to another page of website to retrieve and view information associated with posts i.e. publications of processed messages to shared environment . In some examples by interacting with sitemap link another web page is rendered that displays a list of processed messages classified by the month and year i.e. posting date . Each entry of the list of processed messages not shown may be hyperlinked to another page that when invoked displays another page listing subject lines of individual posted processed messages and an excerpt of the related email. In some examples the subject lines may also be hyperlinked to the complete post which is displayed when the links are invoked. In other examples the above described examples may be varied in function structure format language configuration or other aspects and are not limited to any specific implementation.

As shown each of processed messages may be hyperlinked and when invoked may initiate the instantiation and rendering of another window that displays data information or other content associated with the selected processed message. As described in greater detail below in connection with a selected processed message may be configured to direct a web browsing application not shown to an address that is associated with another web page that presents content such as the original email of the processed message selected. Some data information or content may also be modified in the new window not shown in order to provide data security prevent unauthorized access or perform other functions that would be beneficial to a collaborative data sharing environment such as shared environment . In still other examples window and shared environment may be implemented differently in layout design function structure features or other aspects and are not limited to those shown and provided.

Further any email that is posted in window may also include information associated with the number of votes received by other users e.g. section comments from one or more other users which may also include replies to comments from the posting email sender e.g. section people indicating their like or in some examples dislike not shown of the posted email e.g. section or related information or data e.g. other posts that may be related contextually thematically by sender by topic and others without limitation associated with the given posted email e.g. section . In some examples users may vote for various purposes including expressing their like dislike favor disfavor or other action or expression associated with a given posted email. Still further if a given reader i.e. user likes the posted email she may elect to share the post with another user by using an interactive feature or function such as button that may open another window not shown field not shown interface not shown or the like that permits entry of another user s identifying information e.g. email address user name or the like in order to share the posted content. As an example third party applications such as Facebook Inc. of Menlo Park Calif. may be coupled to an application implementing the described techniques including but not limited to window enabling users e.g. user xyz to share the posted content with other users using the third party application e.g. Facebook Twitter as developed by Twitter Inc. of San Francisco Calif. blogs and other online applications social media media or the like without limitation . In some examples users may not have an account with other social media business websites or the like. However the described techniques enable users to post content e.g. emails and share them with other users through for example an application programming interface API to these other websites using posting module . Referring back to users may also have accounts with third party websites and features may be included to enable these users to share content using the described techniques. In other words the described techniques may be implemented as a service apart from various types of content or social media or entertainment websites but enable users to share send forward reply to retrieve or perform other functions associated with posted emails without requiring the creation of user accounts. As another example the techniques described herein may be used by individual or organizations such as corporate enterprises.

For example a corporate enterprise may use the described techniques in order to provide a closed or private e.g. corporate or in enterprise forum or enterprise for its employees to share email content in a collaborative manner. In some examples corporate employees may post emails using their corporate email addresses. In other examples corporate employees may post emails using assigned or self identified user names that mask an individual email address in order to prevent unwanted responsive email or comments to the posted content. In still other examples by posting emails using the described techniques various individuals or stakeholders within a corporate organization may be placed on a notice of a given user s posted email without requiring the user to individually and specifically identify various addressees. The described techniques aid in eliminating time and labor intensive email creation efforts that corporate users often must undergo in order to notify supervisors managers executives co workers project team members and the like.

As shown various types of purposes may motivate the described techniques for use within a corporate enterprise. In some examples when a user is included as an addressee on a posted email she may elect to stop or continue receiving notification of the posted emails comments votes and other actions associated with these. In other examples posted email subject lines may be used to initiate a discussion forum associated with the given subject. For example if a subject line states Sales Contract the subject line may render the posted email and associated content e.g. available to a user when constructing an email regardless of whether the user is the original author of the email. In other words a user can use the described techniques to send an inline or in thread reply or forward the email to another user who is separate and apart from the population having access to the posted email in some examples the user may be outside of the corporate enterprise or organization . In still other examples window and shared environment may be implemented differently in layout design function structure features or other aspects and are not limited to those shown and provided.

Further shared environment may be designed and implemented to provide one or more functions that may be used in connection with processed message content . For example a comment may be entered in association with processed message content by interacting with comment function which may be implemented as a button or link. When selected comment function may be configured to open a field form or altogether new web page in which a user may enter a subsequent comment using a variety of formats. Likewise if selected share function may be used to share processed message content with another user by for example emailing or using text based messages via simple messaging service i.e. SMS or another format or protocol. Further processed message content may also be flagged or indicated as being inappropriate undesirable copied or otherwise by invoking flag function . Other functions that may be invoked include like function and do not like function .

In some examples if a user likes or wishes to publicly indicate her favor for processed message content she may place a tag or mark to indicate such by invoking like function . Likewise she may also invoke do not like function to indicate that processed message content is undesirable to her. By invoking popularity related functions such as these ranking of published message content may be performed. As yet another function plug in function may be invoked to connect couple distribute publish send re send or perform other functions associated with a third party website or service. For example social media websites that permit user posting of data may provide an application programming interface API that may be used to feed content in a given format for posting or publication. By invoking plug in function processed message content may be posted to other shared environments such as Facebook as developed by Facebook Inc. of Palo Alto Calif. LinkedIn as developed by LinkedIn Inc. of Mountain View Calif. and many other social media related services sites and destinations. In other examples window and the above described elements may be implemented differently in layout design function structure features or other aspects and are not limited to those shown and provided.

As shown data may be analyzed using various techniques. For example data packets may be evaluated by analyzing a given domain associated with the sending email address. A corporate enterprise as an example may have a given domain e.g. company.com that is evaluated in order to provide message visibility to other users having the same domain. This may be implemented in order to provide a service to users and or accounts within the given domain in order to prevent access to information or data. In other examples the above described process may be varied in the implementation order function or structure of each or all steps and is not limited to those provided.

In some examples a check may be performed to determine whether the email being processed was previously processed . If the email was not previously processed a new post with the email should be created . If the email was previously processed in some examples a vote count associated with the email may be incremented or increased. In other examples the above described process may be performed or implemented differently in steps order function or other aspects without limitation to those provided.

Referring back to if no email address is identified then the retrieved email is further processed by evaluating the format of the email to determine whether it is in an HTML based format . A determination is made as to whether the retrieved email is in an HTML based format . If the email is in an HTML based format then it is further evaluated for security threats such as cross site scripting and others as described above . A determination is made as to whether a security threat is present . If a security threat is identified then the retrieved email is purged and not stored in database and or . In other examples an alert message or other warning may be sent to the user of system to indicate that a security threat was found. If no security threat is found then a processed message is generated using the transformed email addresses . After generating a processed message it may be posted to a shared environment e.g. website or shared environments or . In other examples the above described process may be varied in the implementation order function or structure of each or all steps and is not limited to those provided.

For example an email address joe smith.com may be transformed by marking the .com for non modification and replacing joe smith with unidentifiable characters such as xxx xxxxx. Thus the email address in the example above may be transformed from joe smith.com to xxx xxxxx.com. After transforming identified email addresses in the header or body i.e. payload data of a retrieved email message the process then returns to step to continue processing for generating a processed message . In other examples the above described process may be varied in the implementation order function or structure of each or all steps and is not limited to those provided.

According to some examples computer system performs specific operations by processor executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions stored in system memory . Such instructions may be read into system memory from another computer readable medium such as static storage device or disk drive . In some examples hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions for implementation.

The term computer readable medium refers to any tangible medium that participates in providing instructions to processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media and volatile media. Non volatile media includes for example optical or magnetic disks such as disk drive . Volatile media includes dynamic memory such as system memory .

Common forms of computer readable media includes for example floppy disk flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium CD ROM any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes RAM PROM EPROM FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Instructions may further be transmitted or received using a transmission medium. The term transmission medium may include any tangible or intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible medium to facilitate communication of such instructions. Transmission media includes coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including wires that comprise bus for transmitting a computer data signal.

In some examples execution of the sequences of instructions may be performed by a single computer system . According to some examples two or more computer systems coupled by communication link e.g. LAN PSTN or wireless network may perform the sequence of instructions in coordination with one another. Computer system may transmit and receive messages data and instructions including program i.e. application code through communication link and communication interface . Received program code may be executed by processor as it is received and or stored in disk drive or other non volatile storage for later execution.

Once the account is registered electronic mail associated with a domain may be received the electronic mail comprising a plurality of messages each message indicating an address being associated with an account . In some examples the domain may be a single domain or a set of domains associated with a system for electronic mail processing and publication. In some examples a domain may be associated with a plurality of accounts each account having an address associated with the domain. For example multiple addresses may have the same domain i.e. socialmail.com and a plurality of email messages addressed to one or more addresses associated with a domain or a set of related domains may be received by a system for electronic mail processing and publication. In some examples the electronic mail associated with a domain or set of domains may be received or aggregated into a catch all or general mailbox configured to receive mail sent to multiple email addresses e.g. a set of email addresses provided by an electronic mail processing system or service a set of email addresses associated with the same domain or the like . As used herein catch all mailbox refers to a general mailbox configured to receive and aggregate email from a group set or other multiple of email addresses e.g. a group of related email addresses a group of email addresses that share a domain email addresses associated with a group of related domains email addresses for a company or other entity or other groups of email addresses . For example a catch all mailbox may be configured to receive email sent to all or substantially all email addresses having the same domain and a Javascript program may be employed to process the contents of the catch all mailbox i.e. to parse the emails as described below . In other examples email messages associated with each address may be received into an individual mailbox for the address. In still other examples different types and numbers of mailboxes may be implemented for receiving email.

In some examples email messages may be received directly from a content provider e.g. Responsys Constant Contact Vertical Response or the like through for example an API. As used herein a content provider may be a merchant an organization a collective a firm or any other type of entity engaged in providing information e.g. advertisements newsletters updates or other marketing materials to subscribers or other groups of opt in recipients using email. In some examples an API may be configured to receive messages from content providers and deliver those messages to a user by way of a suitable environment e.g. shared environment in which may avoid incorrectly improperly or unnecessarily flagging or filtering a message . In some examples an API implemented by an application for email processing and publication on shared environments e.g. application in may be configured to receive or obtain email or email content from a content provider for subscribers having an account associated with the application without using third party email networks or servers and to bypass one or more filters i.e. spam filters implemented by third party email networks or providers. In some examples such an API may be configured to process data associated with dynamic content e.g. video audio animation links interactive content or the like for presentation on a shared environment in an intended format such that a user may view video or animation content listen to audio or the like in a shared environment. For example such an API may be configured to receive and process data associated with a video to generate output associated with presentation of the video on a tile in a shared environment. In another example such an API may be configured to receive and process data associated with an image to generate output associated with presentation of the image on a tile in a shared environment. In some examples some i.e. multiple or all messages in a shared environment e.g. shared environment in or the like may be presented in an open format where some or all contents i.e. core essential or cleaned contents e.g. subject title or body of a message or the like of a message including graphics images video and other content may be readily viewed without clicking on a link list item or other feature associated with each message on a page. In other examples email may be received through SMTP or other protocols as described herein.

In some examples an account may be configured to store i.e. in database in and manage a user s email subscriptions. In some examples the account associated with an application for email processing and publication on a shared environment e.g. application in may be configured to retrieve or receive i.e. using an API as described herein subscription emails directly and or securely from content providers to which the account is subscribed and to filter and not publish to a shared environment emails from content providers to which the account does not subscribe. For example emails received for an address may be checked against a stored list of subscriptions for an account associated with the address before publication on a shared environment. In an example if an email message is received from a content provider to which the account associated with a recipient address is not subscribed the email message may not be published. In another example if an email message is received from a content provider to which the account associated with a recipient address is subscribed the email message will be given a high priority position in a shared environment e.g. shared environment in and if the email message is received from a content provider to which the account is not subscribed given a low priority position in a shared environment e.g. shared environment in .

Once the electronic mail is received the account with which the address for each message may be identified . In some examples this may include reading the To line or other recipient information from a header section to determine the address to which the message is being sent and matching the address to an account for example using a lookup or otherwise searching a database for an account associated with the address i.e. using Javascript . In other examples an account with which an address for a message may be identified differently and are not limited to those shown and described.

Once an account is identified a clean version of each of the messages may be generated the clean version including a title and a body of the message . As used herein a clean version of a message is one in which a parsing algorithm has cleaned or removed i.e. extracted and separately stored personally identifiable information in the message. As used herein personally identifiable information refers to information that may be used to uniquely identify contact or locate a user e.g. a name an e mail address a phone number a social security number driver s license number other identification number a biometric signature or other form of identification . In other examples sensitive information other than personally identifiable information also may be cleaned from a message. In some examples personally identifiable or other sensitive information may be identified and cleaned from a message header e.g. sender recipient route or other header data . In other examples personally identifiable or other sensitive information may be identified and cleaned from other portions of the message e.g. body other content metadata or the like . In still other examples a clean version of a message may be generated differently and is not limited to those shown and described.

In some examples a vote count associated with the message may be determined and stored . For example a comparison against previously received email messages may be conducted to determine or update or increment a vote count based upon the number of times an identical or substantially identical email message has been sent to other users i.e. other accounts . In another example a vote count for a message may be determined or updated or incremented based upon a number of times the message has been forwarded from one user to another user. In still another example a vote count for a message may be determined or updated or incremented based upon a number of times the message has been posted recommended liked shared or otherwise acted upon by a user to indicate a preference or positive impression of the message e.g. by clicking a hyperlink to recommend share or like a message on Facebook by clicking a hyperlink to share a message on Twitter by clicking a hyperlink to recommend i.e. plus one on Google or the like . In some examples such vote counts may be determined using comparisons of a clean version of a message with data previously stored and associated with identical or substantially identical messages. In some examples a vote count may be displayed on a shared environment e.g. shared environment in for example in a tile for a corresponding message. In other examples a vote count for a message may be determined updated or incremented differently and are not limited to those shown and described.

In some examples the clean version may be stored in a database or other storage as described herein in association with the account to which it was sent . In some examples a clean version also may be published in a shared environment i.e. shared environment in or the like including displaying at least a portion of the clean version in the shared environment the shared environment accessible using access information associated with the account . A shared environment may be a website e.g. website or the like or other facility to which data information or other content may be posted or published as described herein. In some examples the access information may be the access information used in registering the account. In some examples publication of a clean version may include publishing data from the clean version on a tile on a shared environment i.e. . For example a tile on a shared environment might include or show a timestamp i.e. indicating a day date and or time that the message was sent an age i.e. indicating how long ago the message was sent a subject i.e. the subject line of the message a body i.e. some or all of a body of the message a graphic i.e. some or all of the graphics from the message an unsubscribe button other buttons for executing an action associated with the message e.g. comment like share or otherwise provide feedback or other aspects of the message. Displaying one or more messages in a prioritized e.g. left to right top to bottom and the like according to one or more criteria and tiled format or other web browsing interface on a shared environment may promote readability i.e. messages may be easier to see read review skim or otherwise be visually consumed by a user as described below . In some examples a shared environment may include other items e.g. hyperlinks buttons icons widgets or the like for sorting prioritizing sharing searching or performing other acts associated with a published clean version of a message see e.g. . In some examples a message may be tagged i.e. in a database as published after a clean version of the message is posted on a shared environment such that a shared environment may be updated with new messages without re publishing previously published messages. In other examples the above described process may be performed or implemented differently in steps order function or other aspects without limitation to those shown and described.

As shown shared environment may display show or otherwise publish cleaned versions of email messages in an open tiled format where the contents of a cleaned version of a message is displayed in a tile for example including image video or other content. For example each of tiles may represent i.e. show display be associated with or the like a cleaned version of a message. Each tile may display a timestamp or age of a message e.g. timestamp a subject of a message e.g. subjects and a part or all of a body of a message e.g. message bodies . For example timestamp may indicate a day date and or time in which a message i.e. having subject and body was sent. In another example timestamp may indicate an age of a message i.e. number of hours days months or the like since the message was sent . Timestamps may be implemented in a similar manner as described above with respect to timestamp . In some examples subjects each may display a subject line from each of the messages represented in tiles and respectively. In some examples subjects may display text. In other examples subjects may display a graphic i.e. logo image or other graphic . In some examples message bodies may include text one or more graphics hyperlinks e.g. to or provided by a content provider as part of an advertisement by a content provider or the like or other material from a body of a message. For example message body may display a body of a message associated with subject and timestamp which has been cleaned of any personally identifiable and sensitive information. In some examples message body may display an entire body of a clean version of the message. In other examples message body may display a part or portion of a body of a clean version of the message. In some examples tiles may be laid out on shared environment as shown with all or substantially all email messages on shared environment displayed in an open format showing at least a part i.e. a key or essential part e.g. an image a video a significant portion of text or the like or all of the clean content of the message. In other examples tiles may be laid out differently on a website and are not limited to those shown and described.

In some examples each of tiles also may display an unsubscribe buttons e.g. unsubscribe buttons which may link i.e. hyperlink to another page e.g. in a pop up window in a new tab in window in the same window i.e. window in a separate window or the like configured to unsubscribe from a message. As used herein linking link to and hyperlink refers to pointing a web browsing application to another address i.e. URL and retrieving and displaying content from that location. In an example unsubscribe button may link to a page associated with a sender or source i.e. content provider of a message i.e. a clean version in whole or in part displayed in tile for unsubscribing to emails from that sender. In another example an invocation e.g. by clicking placing a cursor over or otherwise selecting of unsubscribe button may automatically unsubscribe a user i.e. an account from receiving email messages from a sender i.e. of the message shown in tile . Unsubscribe buttons each may function similarly for the respective email messages shown in tiles and . In still other examples an unsubscribe button may be implemented differently and is not limited to those shown and described.

In some examples each of tiles also may display a comment icon e.g. comment icons . In some examples a comment icon may link to another page or website e.g. in a pop up window in a new tab in window in the same window i.e. window in a separate window or the like displaying comments associated with a message. For example comment icon may link to another page or another website displaying comments associated with a message i.e. a clean version in whole or in part displayed in tile . Likewise comment icons may respectively link to pages or websites displaying comments associated with messages displayed in tiles and . In other examples a comment icon may link to another page or website providing a user interface for entering comments associated with a message. In yet other examples a comment icon may be implemented differently and is not limited to those shown and described.

In some examples each of tiles also may display other icons for providing feedback e.g. vote icons . As shown vote icons may be displayed as a graphic or image i.e. Facebook s thumb up graphic Twitter s bird graphic Google s Google logo or other image with a number next to it the number indicating a vote count associated with a message shown in the respective tile e.g. vote icon indicates the vote count for a message shown in tile i.e. associated with subject and body vote icon indicates a vote count for a message shown in tile i.e. associated with body and so on . A vote count may be a number of votes representing various types of feedback e.g. likes on Facebook pluses on Google number of times a message i.e. a message displayed in the same tile as the graphic or image is forwarded or other feedback . In some examples a vote count may indicate or represent the number of times a message was sent to other users i.e. other accounts . In other examples a vote count may indicate or represent a number of times the message has been forwarded from one user to another user. In still other examples a vote count may indicate or represent a number of times the message has been posted recommended liked shared or otherwise acted upon by a user to indicate a preference or impression of the message. In some examples vote icons may be implemented as icons or buttons that may be selected to automatically update or increment a vote count. In other examples vote icons may be implemented as hyperlinks that may be selected to link to another page window or website configured to provide a user interface for indicating a vote. In still other examples a vote icon may be implemented differently and is not limited to those shown and described.

In other examples tiles may include other features and display other information associated with a message. For example other information may be shown or displayed in each tile e.g. a sender a link to a related message or the like not shown . In another example graphics buttons or icons not shown may be included in tiles e.g. to delete a message to indicate a user of a social network e.g. Facebook Google Twitter or the like that has recommended commented or otherwise provided feedback regarding a message to prioritize or re arrange i.e. change the order of the message or similar messages or the like . In still another example graphics buttons or icons not shown may be included in tiles for example to link to a website or page associated with a social network account e.g. for a user a user s friend a celebrity that a user is following or the like .

In some examples shared environment may include share button which may be invoked e.g. by clicking placing a cursor over or otherwise selected to render and present a page configured for sharing one or more messages presented in tiles or in other tiles published above or below tiles not shown . In some examples sharing may include forwarding to another user another email address publishing e.g. recommending liking posting linking or otherwise publishing on a social network e.g. Facebook Twitter Google or the like for example using access information associated with both an email account i.e. provided by a system for electronic mail processing and publication and a social network account. In other examples a message published on shared environment may be shared using another hyperlink icon or button e.g. comment icons vote icons or the like provided on the website for example on a tile posting a message. In still other examples messages may be shared differently than described and shown herein.

In some examples shared environment may display or otherwise provide other links icons and or buttons associated with various functions for example linking to other pages associated with shared environment . For example shared environment may include filters for filtering email messages published on shared environment for example by subject matter. In some examples each of filters may be implemented as an icon button or other hyperlink which may be invoked e.g. by clicking placing a cursor over or otherwise selected to show a subset of the messages published on shared environment . For example filter may be invoked to show only a subset of messages being associated with e.g. categorized under tagged as having subject matter regarding or otherwise associated with lifestyle in shared environment . Similarly filter may be invoked to show only a subset of messages being associated with humor in shared environment . Also similarly filters may be invoked to show only a subset of messages being associated respectively with sports technology science miscellaneous and favorites. In some examples shared environment also may include search field which may provide a field for entering a query or term for searching for example data associated with messages being published on shared environment . In some examples search field may enable searching of other data associated with other messages. In still other examples search field may be implemented differently e.g. enable searching of a different data set be a widget provided by a third party or the like and is not limited to those shown and described.

In some examples tiles may be sorted or prioritized according to various criteria. In some examples a default criterion for prioritizing tiles may be the ages of their respective messages. For example tiles may be prioritized from newest message to oldest message i.e. timestamp indicates a more recent date and time or a younger or lesser age i.e. less time has passed since the message having subject and body was sent than timestamp and so on . In other examples tiles may be prioritized according to recommendations from other users e.g. the number of times a message is recommended or liked by a Facebook friend the number of times a message has been posted or re posted on Twitter the number of times a message has been shared on Google or the like . In still other examples tiles may be prioritized according to other criteria specified by a user having access to shared environment i.e. a user may customize the presentation or view of messages on their shared environment according to his or her preferences . For example a page widget or other user interface i.e. as part of website may be provided for a user to input or select preferences including identifying or selecting one or more criteria for prioritizing email messages on their shared environment e.g. shared environment or identifying interests i.e. topics subjects hobbies or the like in order to receive targeted advertising or recommendations on content providers to which the user may want to subscribe. In some examples a button or feature not shown may be provided on each tile for prioritizing an email or a group of emails e.g. from a favored content provider a school newsletter or the like for example to cause presentation of the email or group of emails in a high priority position e.g. at the top of the page in a designated or set off section of the page or the like in the shared environment. In other examples an email or message may be demoted or otherwise designated as having lower priority using the techniques described herein e.g. a button link feature preferences selection or the like for example to cause presentation of the email or message in a low priority position e.g. lower in or at the bottom of the page or the like . In still other examples window and the above described elements may be implemented differently in layout design function structure features or other aspects and are not limited to the examples shown and described.

As described herein shared environment may be configured to present information from marketing or other opt in emails in an open format i.e. without a need for clicking on an item or link from an email list to open a message including graphics images videos audio content other dynamic content or the like. As described herein shared environment may be configured with buttons links and other features for ease of managing email content including a prominent unsubscribe button e.g. unsubscribe buttons and prioritization and demotion of messages for customizing presentation of message in shared environment . In other examples shared environment may include other features for managing email content. For example shared environment may include a related content or show me more button not shown on each tile configured to provide i.e. present a user with similar content e.g. advertisements newsletters or other content associated with a brand a product a collection a subject matter or other category of items associated with a message presented in the tile . In another example shared environment may include a link on a tile for purchasing an item offered by or related to an email message. In still other examples the above described elements may be implemented differently in layout design function structure features or other aspects and are not limited to the examples shown and described.

In some examples an application for email processing and publication on shared environment e.g. application in may be configured to gather organize process and or store data i.e. track data associated with user preferences and activity i.e. actions on or interactions with shared environment as described above. For example a variety of types of data associated with messages displayed on shared environment including a user s activity may be tracked for use in targeting advertisements and other subscription emails that may be of interest to a user. Activity data may include types of i.e. subjects products brands interests or other aspects of content in emails subscribed to unsubscribed from prioritized demoted liked by friends linked to viewed many times viewed for long periods of time trends indicated by such activity or other metrics. Such activity data may be processed to determine trends patterns or other useful information about a user e.g. buying patterns media e.g. books video music and the like preferences interests hobbies and the like . In some examples targeted advertisements or subscription email suggestions e.g. newsletters marketing emails or other opt in emails that may be of interest to a user may be determined and provided to a user based upon activity data associated with the user s account. In other examples targeted advertisements or subscription email suggestions may be determined and provided to a user based upon activity data associated with one or more groups or a plurality of users. In some examples activity data may be used by an application for email processing and publication on shared environment e.g. application in to provide targeted advertisements or subscription email suggestions to a user. In other examples such activity data may be shared with or provided to content providers for their use in targeting advertisements marketing emails newsletters and the like. For example activity data indicating a user subscribes to prioritizes and or has friends that like a string instrument newsletter may cause an application for email processing and publication on shared environment e.g. application in or a content provider to target an advertisement for a hand cream to the user. In still other examples data associated with an application for email processing and publication on shared environment may be used differently and are not limited to the examples shown and described.

In some examples shared environment may be configured for display or presentation on a mobile client or device. For example shared environment may be displayed using a mobile application or mobile web browser installed on a mobile computing or communications device. In some examples an application for email processing and publication on shared environments e.g. application in may be configured to process content e.g. video audio text image or other data in a subscription email from a content provider for presentation in a shared environment on a mobile application or mobile web browser. In some examples an application for email processing and publication on shared environments e.g. application in may be configured i.e. using HTML5 or other language or program for structuring and presenting content on a web application or browser to detect a type of mobile computing or communications device and to render content based on the type of mobile computing or communications device. In other examples the above described elements may be implemented differently in layout design function structure features or other aspects and are not limited to the examples shown and described.

Attention is now directed to where one example of a flow diagram for generating a grid view including one or more tiles is depicted. At a stage an electronic email message EMM e.g. an email a message a newsletter an advertisement an invoice etc. is received at a first domain. The first domain may be any unique address that may be electronically accessed such as by way of an email address a uniform resource identifier URI a uniform resource locator URL a uniform resource name URN or the like that defines an entity and or resource by name for example. A syntax character string or other used for accessing the first domain may include but is not limited to HyperText Transfer Protocol e.g. http HyperText Markup Language HTML or other formats. The EMM may itself be in a format such as HTML for example and may include tags or other identifiers that may be used to divine the content of the EMM.

At a stage the EMM is parsed to identify content in the EMM for subsequent tiling as will be described below. Content in the EMM may include but is not limited to text images media metadata objects links lists and hyperlinks to other content for example. Media may include but is not limited to audio video audio video animation and other media formats. The EMM may include tags that are associated with and may define or describe the content the tag is associated with. The tags may be associated with and or recognized those typically used by browsers e.g. Firefox Chrome IE Bing or others that operate on HTML data. Parsing at the stage may be accomplished using a variety of software algorithms program code and the like including but not limited to Java parsers that are Java based a custom parser or others.

At a stage content identified by the parsing at the stage is extracted into one or more content types. The one or more content types may be those described above but are not limited to content types described herein. For purposes of explanation the following may be some of the content types that are extracted text T image I media M and link L . In that an image or text may also be a moving image or text as in a movie or video moving images and text may fall with the media content designation. Text T and image I unless otherwise stated may refer to still images and still text. Media M may comprise all other types of content that may be extracted regardless of the actual type of media. For example media M may include audio video animation etc. Link L content may refer to any type of link e.g. a hypertext link or other regardless of form or syntax that may be recognized acted upon and used to designate a location or address of some item or object such as link to a web page web site ftp site etc.

At a stage some or all of the content types extracted at the stage are deconstructed into a tile format that is configured for content rotation of the one or more content types. Therefore text T content types may be broken down into a tile format that allows for content rotation of the text e.g. ASCII character strings from the ASCII character set or equivalents contained in the T content type. Similarly image I content may be broken down into a tile format that allows for content rotation of the image or images contained in the I content type. In some applications some content types such as media M or link L may not be configured for content rotation. Furthermore in some applications text T and or image I content may not be configured for content rotation. Whether or not content may be configured for content rotation may be determined at least in part by a tag or tags associated with the content for example.

At a stage a tile is generated using the file format generated by the deconstructing as the stage . As will be described below a tile may be a discrete entity such as a file or other object that may be operated on and manipulated by a browser or other software program or algorithm. For example the tile format may include syntax for HTML and the tile may be generated from the HTML in the tile format. Moreover the tile that is generated may include HTML in its syntax and or use HTML to describe at least some of its data. Generating the tile using the tile format may further include formatting the data in the tile for display system the tile may be viewed on e.g. a display of a smartphone tablet pad laptop notebook computer computer monitor HDTV etc .

At a stage the tile is associated with an account of a subscriber to the first domain. As one example of the EMM was communicated e.g. sent via email to Jane Doe first.domain.com then the generated tile would be associated with the account of Jane Doe in a manner similar to that of an email account being associated with an account name and a domain the account is registered to such as jane.doe yahoo.com or jane doe gmail.com.

At a stage a grid view is generated and the tile and optionally any other tiles that are associated with the account at the stage may be included in the grid view. As will be described below the grid view may include a single tile or a plurality of tiles however the grid view may display only a portion of the plurality of tiles. For example if there are 57 tiles in the grid view and a display system the grid view is displayed on may only display no more than 20 tiles at a time then other tiles in the grid view may not be displayed until some action such as scrolling the display is taken to bring the unseen tiles into view.

At a stage if additional EMM s are received at the first domain then the flow may resume at some prior stage such as the stage for example. A plurality of other domains may be transmitting a plurality of EMM s addressed to the first domain. To that end flow may execute as needed to process each EMM to generate tiles for grid views and content rotation for each subscriber registered or otherwise associated with the first domain. In some applications the first domain may be regarded as an aggregating domain where EMM s from a plurality of different domains are aggregated and processed into tiles for grid viewing and content rotation for a plurality of subscriber to the aggregating domain.

Moving on to one example of an electronic email message having different content types is depicted. Here electronic email message may be in a variety of forms and or file formats such as a page or the like for example. In the example depicted EMM includes a plurality of different content types which are presented for the purposes of explanation only are not to be construed as limiting examples. Other content types not depicted in may be included without limitation into EMM . Moreover EMM may include more or fewer content and or content types than depicted in . Content types in EMM may include but is not limited to one or more text types denoted as T1 T6 one or more image types denoted as I1 I3 one or more media types denoted as M1 M2 and one or more link types denoted as L1 L2. EMM may derive from a variety of sources and or domains including but not limited to those denoted as . There may be more or few sources for EMM as denoted by .

As one example a subscriber may subscribe to an email newsletter about the Hubble Space Telescope and denoted as newsletter . Each issue of the newsletter is emailed as EMM to the address of the subscriber at the first domain e.g. the aggregating domain . The flow may be applied to the EMM to generate at least one tile. As one example tags in EMM may identify the various content types as described above and may also be used to define associations or linkages between the same or different content types within EMM . Therefore image I1 may be associated with text T1 and T2 and with link L2. T1 may be one or more paragraphs sentences or the like that are germane to the image I1 of the Hubble Space Telescope e.g. describing the capabilities of the telescope and T2 may be one or more paragraphs sentences or the like that describe where more information may be found by clicking or otherwise activating link L1 e.g. a one or more hypertext links . Image I1 may be a single image that may be static or I1 may be a series of images e.g. as in an image gallery . The one or more paragraphs sentences or the like for T1 and T2 may be too long to view in the space allocated to them during the tiling process or to fit on the screen allocated in the grid view as will be described above. To that end the tiling process at the stages and or may configure T1 T2 and I1 for content rotation such that positioning a cursor e.g. hovering or flying over or other user interface UI construct over a selected tile and or over text or image in the selected tile cause the content comprising the text or image to rotate. Content rotation may comprise scrolling or rolling the text of T1 and or T2 e.g. as is done with movie credits or stepping through playing back or cycling through the images in I1 in some order or sequence for example. Image I1 may include ten images of the telescope and content rotation may comprise displaying each of the ten images in a sequence that is timed e.g. 2 seconds per image or stepping through each of the ten images by some action of the UI e.g. moving a cursor up or down while it is positioned over the image . Similarly the text in T1 may be ten paragraphs long and content rotation may comprise displaying at least a portion of each paragraph in some sequence timed or otherwise. If text T1 and image I1 are linked that is they are somehow related by content editorial etc. then during content rotation then paragraph 1 of 10 of I1 that is associated with image 1 of 10 of T1 will rotate whilst that image is being displayed in the selected tile followed by subsequent paragraphs undergoing content rotation when their associated image is rotated into view within the selected tile.

Content types without limitation may be associated with one or more other content types and content rotation among associated content types may be application specific and or determined by tags or other data included in the EMM from which they were derived. Media content types may vary as widely as numerous varieties of media that may be included in an EMM. Media M1 may be a movie that when activated e.g. by hovering may intimate content rotation and or some other action. Content rotation of M1 may merely comprise commencing playback of the underlying movie content within the selected tile. text T5 may be subtitles that are associated with M1 and content rotation may comprise a synchronized scrolling of text T5 as M1 is played back. In that M1 may comprise a movie TV show video or the like during content rotation any sound audio or sound track for M1 may also be played back e.g. over a speaker system or headphones etc. . Media M2 may comprise music and T6 may comprise lyrics or a score of the music and may content rotate in association with content rotation of M2. Link L2 may comprise one or more links e.g. hyperlinks associated with image I2 and may content rotate through the one or more links while is I2 active. The foregoing are non limiting examples of what may be done with content types in a tile and actual implementations will be application specific and may be programmed or otherwise coded to control behavior of content types in a tile.

Referring now to where one example of a grid view including a plurality of tiles displayed on a display system are depicted. Here dashed horizontal and vertical grid lines are depicted to illustrate that the grid view may include an orderly arrangement of tiles that may have the same size however the grid view may include an arrangement of tiles that is not orderly and the tiles need not be the same size or shape and may have other than rectangular or square shapes. Grid view may include more or fewer tiles as denoted by and . If the grid view contains more tiles than may be displayed by display system then horizontal and or vertical scroll bars or the like may be used to bring other tiles into view on the display system as will be described below. Typically each tile may comprise content from different EMM s that have been processed such as by flow of .

Turning now to where one example of different configurations for tiles in the grid view and flying or hovering over a tile to initiate content rotation CR of content in the tile are depicted. In tiles in grid view may have different shapes and sizes and need not be arranged in an orderly manner as compared to the tiles depicted in . A cursor is depicted as being a non limiting example of a user interface UI that may be used to select or activate a tile in the grid view . When cursor is not touching and or positioned over a tile the cursor is denoted as conversely when the cursor is and or positioned over a tile the cursor is denoted as . A device such a mouse track pad or other at behest of a user may cause cursor to move from its present location and fly or hover over circular tile thereby causing that tile to be selected or activated for content rotation CR where the cursor activating a tile is denoted as because it is present selecting tile . Content rotation CR or one or more content types displayed within tile is now enabled and may continue so long as cursor remains in a position to select that tile e.g. continues to hover over tile . Subsequently the cursor moves from circular tile to rectangular tile . Content rotation CR is halted in circular tile because that tile is no longer selected or activated and content rotation CR is initiated in rectangular tile because that tile is currently selected by cursor . Moving the cursor away from any selected tile may cause content rotation CR to terminate in that tile. When the cursor is not positioned and or touching any of the tiles in grid view e.g. as in cursor then all tiles in the grid view may be disabled for content rotation CR.

Description now turns to where one example of a selected tile is made visually more prominent than un selected tiles in grid view . Here selected tile transitions e.g. zooms from its initial size to a larger size denoted as tile in the grid view and remains at the larger size so long as it is selected by cursor . Relative to the other un selected tiles in grid view selected tile is more visually prominent in the grid view and dominates a larger portion of the viewing area of display system than the un selected tiles.

While the cursor continues to hover or otherwise select tile content such as image I1 text T1 or both may have content rotation CR initiated in any temporal sequence such as at the same time or a different times for example. A rate at which content is rotated may be the same or deferment for content types in a selected tile. Tile may transition back to its un selected size in the grid view when the cursor is removed and or ceases to hover over the tile such that tile morphs from its selected an prominent display in the grid back to its un selected view in the grid as tile . A similar to from transition may occur for the other tiles in grid view with each tile transitioning to a prominent view when selected and morphing back to its normal non prominent view upon becoming un selected. Un selected tiles may be configured to have a muted or visually diminished appearance relative to a selected tile or selected tiles in the same grid view which may be configured to have a more striking or visually dominant appearance. Although a single selected tile has been descried with regard to the grid view the present application is not limited to only one tile being active at the same time and in some applications actions by the UI e.g. a CTRL sequence on a keyboard or the like may cause a plurality of tiles to be selected or otherwise activated at the same time in the same grid view and content type in each of the plurality of selected tiles may have content rotation CR.

Turning now to where a grid view of plurality of tiles and their respective content types with one of the tiles being selected and having content rotation CR of its content. Here grid view may appear as a tab or the like in a web browser e.g. Chrome Fire Fox BING IE or other presented on display system e.g. a touch screen laptop display desktop PC display smartphone display tablet pad display LCD OLED HDTV projection display virtual image display HUD Plasma Display 3D Display or other . Other grid views not shown may be presented in other tabs such as tab for example. In tab some of the tiles in grid view may be on screen as shown and other tiles in the grid view may be off screen not shown but may be brought into view or out of view by moving a scroll bar via cursor or other UI methods for example. In some examples a finger or stylus on a touch screen device may comprise the UI. In other example a keyboard track pad arrow keys mouse or similar tracking device may comprise the UI. In yet other examples a gesture recognition system that tracks a user s body movements and or gestures e.g. the eyes facial features hands etc. may comprise the UI. The actual UI that interacts with the grid view and it tiles will be application dependent and is not limited by the examples described herein.

In a subscriber to the aggregating domain upon logging in e.g. user name password into the domain may enter an address e.g. URL where tiles associated with the subscribers subscribed to EMM s are populated with the various content types as described above. The processed EMM s presented in the tile format may reflect the subscribers interest in food fashion automobiles bicycling fitness bargain hunting and a variety of other interests. As one example a received EMM relating to a bespoke bicycle shop in another state is subscribed to by the subscriber is processed after being received and generated into tile which becomes selected tile when activated by cursor . Content rotation CR of text T1 textually describes in several paragraphs custom bicycle features being visually displayed in regard to content rotation CR of image I1 which comprises several images for each of the custom features. Paragraph one may describe features in image one and so forth. In some examples the subscriber may have other persons or entities that he she may wish to share some or all of the content in a tile . To that end a tile may include an icon or other field or image that when activated e.g. via the cursor or other may allow the tile s content to be shared e.g. as another EMM to another domain . For example activating a Share icon in selected tile may cause content in that tile to be emailed or otherwise transmitted to an address such as an email address URI URN URL or other. In some examples activating the Share icon results in content in the selected tile being shared only with another subscriber to the aggregating domain . That is Jane Doe aggregating.domain.com may share tile with one or more subscribers such as subscriber John.Doe aggregating.domain.com for example. Although not depicted in selected tile or any other selected tile s in grid view may be displayed with prominent view as described in regards to tile in . In grid view moving the cursor to neutral region of the display system as denoted by dashed lines may operate to deactivate e.g. render as un selected all tiles and prevent content rotation CR in the un selected tiles . A logo or other identifier of the goods and or services of the aggregating domain may be displayed in the grid view . Tiles in the grid view may be searched using a search tool or the like by entering a search string in the search tool for example.

Attention is now directed to where one example of a flow diagram for generating a carousel view including one or more tiles is depicted. To simplify explanation stages and may be identical or similar to the stages and as described above in reference to flow in therefore a stage where a carousel view that is different than the grid view will be discussed in conjunction with . At the stage the carousel view is generated for a tile for display on the display system . Here the tiles that are generated for the carousel view may be identical to those generated for the grid view however the manner in which the tiles are visually presented in the carousel view differs from that of the grid view .

Moving now to where depicts one example of a carousel view including a plurality of tiles displayed on a display system . Here moving cursor from an un selecting position on display system to a selected position on tile is operative to activate select tile for content rotation CR in the carousel view depicted in where one example of different configurations for tiles in the carousel view and flying or hovering over selected tile to make selected tile visually prominent and to position un selected tiles around a perimeter of the selected tile is depicted. As selected in the carousel view tile may be moved to a centralized location on display system and may have its dimensions and or shaped change to make it visually more dominant e.g. takes up more of the display than un selected tiles which may not change in size or shape and or may be made smaller in dimension to emphasize their diminished visual importance relative to selected tile for example. A portion of some un selected tiles may be partially on screen and off screen as denoted by and as before may be moved into and out of view using scroll bars or the like. Selected tile need not be centrally positioned on display system as depicted in and may be positioned anywhere on the display system .

Reference is now made to where carousel view of plurality of tiles and and their respective content types and selected tile being visually prominent and having content rotation CR of its content are depicted. Here un selected tiles may be visually less distinct in size color brightness clarity of text and or imagery which for purposes of description will be generally denoted as Muted in appearance relative to visually more striking and prominent selected tile . Un selected tiles positioned about perimeter are Muted and the selected tile is visually Striking and its content may undergo content rotation CR. A logo or other identifier of the goods and or services of the aggregating domain may be displayed in the carousel view . Tiles in the grid view may be searched using a search tool or the like by entering a search string in the search tool for example.

Attention is now directed to where one example of a flow diagram for reducing unsubscribe requests includes at a stage receiving a request from a requester e.g. a user and or subscriber to Unsubscribe from a subscribed to domain. An example of a subscribed to domain may include but is not limited to an email subscription to a newsletter an email relationship with online retailer an email relationship with a business an email relationship with a social network an email relationship with a professional network just to name a few. In many instances a subscriber may have at some point solicited the emails by agreeing to receive them at a domain provided by the subscriber such as Jane.Doe mymail.com or some other email address for example. As one example emails from the subscribed to domain may include a statement such as You are receiving this e mail because our records indicate you requested that we send information Jane.Doe mymail.com regarding special offers newsletters product information and updates from Socks Shoes.com. However due to receiving too many emails in general from a variety of sources and or too many emails from the subscribed to domain the subscriber makes a decision to unsubscribe and requests to unsubscribed by taking an action such as clicking on This e mail is a Socks Shoes.com advertisement. If you no longer wish to receive our marketing e mails unsubscribe here. If you have difficulty with the unsubscribe link you may also send an e mail to PrivacyManager socks shoes.com. For more information read our Privacy Policy or call 1 888 777 7777. At the stage the requester e.g. the subscriber may have clicked on the unsubscribe here hyperlink to effectuate the unsubscribe request. At a stage the requester may be redirected to an unsubscribe domain that may not necessarily be associated with the subscribed to domain. In some applications the unsubscribe domain may be a third party domain acting as an agent for the subscribed to domain and operative to carry out the unsubscribe request or offer additional options to the requester. At a stage a plurality of options e.g. in addition to an unsubscribe option are presented to the requester.

At a stage a first option to unsubscribe may be presented for selection by the requester. If a YES branch is taken then the requester has made the decision to unsubscribe from the subscribed to domain and flow transitions to a stage where the requesters desire to unsubscribe from the subscribed to domain is executed thereby removing the requesters email address or the like from future emails or EMM s from the subscribed to domain. Flow may terminate after execution of the stage .

If a NO branch is taken from the stage then a second option to learn more may be presented for selection by the requester at a stage . If a YES branch is taken from the stage then the requester has selected to learn more about an aggregating domain and flow transitions to a stage . At the stage the requester is presented with information regarding an aggregating domain where instead of terminating the receiving emails from the subscribed to domain those emails and optionally other EMM s from other domains that are received by the requester may be sent to an address e.g. a unique address such as Jane.Doe agreegating.domain.com for the requester at the aggregating domain. At a stage the requester may decide whether or not to Opt In to the aggregating domain. If a YES branch is taken at the stage then the flow continues to a stage where a subscription to the aggregating domain is registered for the requester. The flow may terminate after execution of the stage . If the NO branch is taken from the stage then the flow may return to a prior stage in the flow such as the stage for example.

Returning to the stage if the NO branch is taken from the stage the flow may transition to a stage where a third option to register a subscription with the aggregating domain may be presented for selection by the requester. If the YES branch is taken from the stage then the flow may transition to the stage as described above. If the NO branch is taken from the stage then the flow may transition to a stage . At the stage a fourth option to reduce a frequency at which content e.g. EMM s is delivered from the subscribed to domain may be presented to the requester. If a YES branch is selected at the stage then flow may transition to a stage where frequency of content delivery to a specified address e.g. an address on the aggregating domain is reduced. If a NO branch is take from stage then flow may return to a prior stage in the flow such as the stage for example.

Turning now to where one example of a scenario for handling an unsubscribe request that may result in registration with an aggregating domain is depicted. Here a requester may request e.g. at the stage to unsubscribe from a subscribed to domain by using a cursor or other UI to click on or otherwise activate an unsubscribe request contained in an EMM e.g. an email from the subscribed to domain or on a web site page for the subscribed to domain. The request triggers a redirection e.g. at the stage to an unsubscribe domain which may be a domain including but not limited to the same domain as the subscribed to domain a third party domain or the aggregating domain for example. The unsubscribe domain offers the requester a plurality of options as described above in regard to flow including but not limited to unsubscribing from any future EMM s from the subscribed to domain by selecting using cursor learning more about the aggregating domain by selecting using cursor registering with the aggregating domain by selecting using cursor and reducing email frequency by selecting using cursor .

The learning more at the stage and or the registering at the stage may result in an actual registration of the requester with the aggregating domain . Registration may include but is not limited to information such as the requester filling out information necessary to establish an account with the aggregating domain such as first name last name user name password an email address at the aggregating domain a frequency of email delivery if the option was also selected and a security question such as a challenge question e.g. What city were you born in for example. For example Jan Doe may select jane doe aggregating.domain.com as her email address for future emails from the subscribed to domain to be sent to and if option was selected then the subscribed to domain would send emails to the aggregating domain address jane doe aggregating.domain.com at a frequency of once a week for example.

Turning now to where another example of a flow diagram for reducing unsubscribes is depicted. In contrast to flow of flow includes at a stage receiving a request form a requester to unsubscribe from a subscribed to domain. At a stage the requester is redirected to an unsubscribe domain. At a stage the requester address e.g. email address EMM address is unsubscribed from the subscribed to domain and the requester may receive a message such as You Have Been Unsubscribed e.g. see in . At a stage after the requester s address has already been unsubscribed from the subscribed to domain a plurality of options may be presented to the requester.

At a stage a 1option to learn more is presented to the requester. If a YES branch is taken then the requester has selected to learn more about an aggregating domain and flow transitions to a stage . At the stage the requester is presented with information regarding an aggregating domain where instead of terminating the receiving of emails from the subscribed to domain those emails and optionally other EMM s from other domains that are received by the requester may be sent to an address e.g. a unique address such as John Doe agreegating.domain.com for the requester at the aggregating domain.

At a stage the requester may decide whether or not to Opt In to the aggregating domain. If a YES branch is taken at the stage then the flow continues to a stage where a subscription to the aggregating domain is registered for the requester. The flow may terminate after execution of the stage . If the NO branch is taken from the stage then the flow may return to another stage in the flow such as a stage where no further action may be taken in regard to unsubscribing the requester s address at the stage that is the requesters address remains unsubscribed from the subscribed to domain.

If the NO branch is taken from the stage then flow transitions to a stage where a second option to register a subscription is selected by the requester and the flow continues to the stage where the subscription is registered on the aggregating domain as was described above. The flow may terminate after execution of the stage . If the NO branch is taken from the stage then the flow may transition to the stage as described above.

Referring now to where another example of a scenario for handling an unsubscribe request that may result in registration with an aggregating domain is depicted. Here the requester clicking on or otherwise activating an unsubscribed icon or the like results in the transition to the unsubscribe domain where an actual unsubscribing of the requesters address from the subscribed to domain occurs as described above in reference to stage . In that the requester s unsubscribe request is fulfilled e.g. at the stage the plurality of options e.g. 1and 2Options and or are presented to the requester as described above at the stage . The Learn More at the stage may include a discussion of the benefits of registering with the aggregating domain as described above and the requester may decide to Opt In followed by registering a subscription as describe above for the stages and . Similarly the requester selecting the 2Option to Register e.g. at the stage results in registering a subscription with the aggregating domain at the stage . The information to be provided by the requester to register the subscription with the aggregating domain may be as described above in reference to .

EMM s received at address jane doe aggregating.domain.com at aggregating domain as well as any other EMM s received at the same address e.g. EMM s not resulting from flows and or may be processed in to tiles with content rotation CR for display in grid view and or carousel view as was described above in reference to . In some examples pre processed tiles may be received at the aggregating domain and may not require some or all of the stages described above in reference to flows and or . A pre processed tile may be processed using one or more of the stages described above in reference to flows and or . Processing of tiles and or pre processed tiles may be by hardware software or both. A pre processed tile may be a tile in grid view or carousel view that is communicated to another address by activating the Share option described above in reference to for example. In some applications the aggregating domain may be socialmail.com as described above and the address may be john doe socialmail.com for example. In some examples the domains such as the subscribed to domain the unsubscribe domain and the aggregating domain need not be a .com and may be a .org .gov .biz .edu or other domains without limitation.

Tiles as described herein may be configured to simplify an amount of interaction required by a user to divine the content type s presented in the tile . For example unlike emails or other EMM s in an inbox or folder of a conventional email system engine a user may not want to take actions such as Reply Forward Cc Bcc or other actions with respect to the tile and may merely wish to view the content of the tile and then move on to another tile of interest. Therefore the ability to Reply Forward Cc Bcc or take other actions relating to tiles and their content may be unavailable to the user either by user election e.g. user configurable settings and or preferences or by algorithms operating on the aggregating domain for example. In some examples tiles may persist after being selected for viewing content rotation CR by a user. In other examples tiles may be relegated to a trash can bin folder deleted items a recycle bin or the like after being selected for viewing content rotation CR by a user. In yet other examples tiles after being selected for viewing content rotation CR by a user may be moved out of view on the grid or carousel and unviewed tiles that were not previously in view on the grid or carousel may be moved into view to replace already viewed tiles that were moved out of view. After a tile is viewed that tile may remain in the grid or carousel but with an altered or muted appearance that indicates to the user that the user has already viewed that tile .

Although the foregoing examples have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding the above described inventive techniques are not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways of implementing the above described techniques for the present application. The disclosed examples are illustrative and not restrictive.
