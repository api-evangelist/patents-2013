No. PCT US10 37153 filed Jun. 3 2010 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 184 339 filed Jun. 5 2009 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention is directed to artificial tears suitable for treating dry eye syndrome in a human or other mammal which comprises a mixture of castor oil with at least one other oil for example a naturally occurring oil e. g. olive oil sesame oil corn oil etc. 

Typical symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis or dry eye include feelings of dryness burning and a sandy gritty eye sensation that can worsen during the day. Symptoms may also be described as itchy scratchy stingy or tired eyes. Other symptoms include pain redness a pulling sensation and pressure behind the eye. The damage to the eye surface resulting from dry eye increases discomfort and sensitivity to bright light and both eyes usually are affected.

Because blinking coats the eye with tears symptoms are worsened by activities in which the rate of blinking is reduced due to prolonged use of the eyes. These activities include prolonged reading computer usage driving or watching television. Symptoms increase in windy dusty or smoky areas in dry environments high altitudes including airplanes on days with low humidity and in areas where an air conditioner fan or heater is being used. Symptoms are less severe during cool rainy or foggy weather and in humid places. Most people who have dry eyes experience mild irritation with no long term effects. However if the condition is left untreated or becomes severe it can produce complications that can cause eye damage resulting in impaired vision or possibly in the loss of vision.

Having dry eyes for a prolonged period of time can lead to tiny abrasions on the surface of the eyes. In advanced cases the epithelium undergoes pathologic changes namely squamous metaplasia and loss of goblet cells sometimes due to activation of T cells directed. Some severe cases result in thickening of the corneal surface corneal erosion punctate keratopathy epithelial defects corneal ulceration corneal neovascularization corneal scarring corneal thinning and even corneal perforation. An abnormality of any one of the three layers of tears which produces an unstable tear film may result in symptoms of keratitis sicca.

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is usually due to inadequate tear production. The aqueous tear layer is affected resulting in aqueous tear deficiency or lacrimal hyposecretion. The lacrimal gland does not produce sufficient tears to keep the entire conjunctiva and cornea covered by a complete layer. This usually occurs in people who are otherwise healthy. Increased age is associated with decreased tearing. This is the most common type found in postmenopausal women. Causes include idiopathic congenital alacrima xerophthalmia lacrimal gland ablation and sensory denervation. In rare cases it may be a symptom of collagen vascular diseases including rheumatoid arthritis Wegener s granulomatosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Sj gren s syndrome and autoimmune diseases associated with Sj gren s syndrome are also conditions associated with aqueous tear deficiency. Drugs such as isotretinoin sedatives diuretics tricyclic antidepressants antihypertensives oral contraceptives antihistamines nasal decongestants beta blockers phenothiazines atropine and pain relieving opiates such as morphine can cause or worsen this condition. Infiltration of the lacrimal glands by sarcoidosis or tumors or postradiation fibrosis of the lacrimal glands can also cause this condition.

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can also be caused by abnormal tear composition resulting in rapid evaporation or premature destruction of the tears. When caused by rapid evaporation it is termed evaporative dry eyes. In this condition although the tear gland produces a sufficient amount of tears the rate of evaporation of the tears is too rapid. There is a loss of water from the tears that results in tears that are too salty or hypertonic. As a result the entire conjunctiva and cornea cannot be kept covered with a complete layer of tears during certain activities or in certain environments.

Aging is one of the most common causes of dry eyes. This is due to the fact that tear production decreases with age. It may be caused by thermal or chemical burns or by adenoviruses. Diabetics are also at increased risk for dry eye.

An eye injury or other problem with the eyes or eyelids such as bulging eyes or a drooping eyelid can cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Disorders of the eyelid can impair the complex blinking motion required to spread tears.

About half of all people who wear contact lenses have dry eyes. This is because soft contact lenses which float on the tear film that covers the cornea absorb the tears in the eyes. Dry eye also occurs or gets worse after refractive surgeries in which the corneal nerves are cut during the creation of a corneal flap because the corneal nerves stimulate tear secretion. Dry eyes caused by these procedures usually disappear after several months.

Abnormalities of the lipid tear layer caused by blepharitis and rosacea and abnormalities of the mucin tear layer caused by vitamin A deficiency trachoma diphtheric keratoconjunctivitis mucocutaneous disorders and certain topical medications may cause dry eye or keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

Dry eyes can usually be diagnosed by the symptoms alone. Tests can determine both the quantity and the quality of the tears. A slit lamp examination can be performed to diagnose dry eyes and to document any damage to the eye. A Schirmer s test can measure the amount of moisture bathing the eye. This test is useful for determining the severity of the condition.

A variety of approaches can be taken to treatment such as avoidance of exacerbating factors tear stimulation and supplementation increasing tear retention and eyelid cleansing and treatment of eye inflammation.

For mild and moderate cases supplemental lubrication is the most important part of treatment. Application of artificial tears every few hours can provide temporary relief.

Lubricating tear ointments can be used during the day but they generally are used at bedtime due to poor vision after application. They contain white petrolatum mineral oil and similar lubricants. They serve as a lubricant and an emollient. Depending on the severity of the condition ointments may be applied from every hour to just at bedtime. Ointments should not be used with contact lenses. Inflammation occurring in response to tears film hypertonicity can be suppressed by mild topical steroids or with topical immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine.

Topical 0.05 cyclosporine A as a castor oil based ophthalmic emulsion is marketed in the United States by Allergan under the trade mark RESTASIS . RESTASIS decreases surface inflammation of the eye. It is thought to work through inhibition of transcription factors required for cytokine production and T lymphocyte maturation. In a trial involving 1200 people RESTASIS increased tear production in 15 of people compared to 5 with placebo. Usually 1 drop of RESTASIS is instilled in each eye twice a day 12 hours apart.

The present invention provides artificial tears which comprise a blend or mixture of castor oil with another oil i.e. a food oil or healthy oil such as olive oil sesame oil corn oil soybean oil safflower oil cottonseed oil peanut oil etc. Such blend of oils may be emulsified or dispersed in an aqueous phase e.g. water to provide a composition suitable for topical application to the eye of a mammal suffering from dry eye to relieve the symptoms thereof. Furthermore the present invention provides a method for treating keratoconjunctivitis sicca KCS comprising providing the above composition and administering said composition topically to the ocular surface or immediate vicinity of an eye of a patient.

Castor oil may be used in ophthalmic emulsion formulations for treating diseases and conditions of the eye because of its spreading properties. For example it is believed that this ability to spread on an aqueous surface enables castor oil to form a thin layer on the ocular surface thereby reducing evaporation and helping alleviate symptoms of dry eye. There is a high level of interest in using other oils referred to as healthy oils or food oils such as olive oil in ocular formulas for dry eye treatment. However the spreading ability of these oils was found to be poor as compared to castor oil. Food oils or healthy oils are described in United States Patent Application Publication No. US2008 0070834 A1 which is hereby incorporated by reference. 

When a drop of castor oil is added over the surface of water or model tear solution it spreads quickly forming a thin layer on the surface of the aqueous fluid. In contrast other oils such as soybean oil olive oil safflower oil corn oil sesame oil peanut oil and cotton seed oil do not spread over the surface of either water or model tear solution even after overnight application.

It has now been surprisingly found that even small amounts of castor oil added to the healthy oils improves the spreading properties of these oils. It is believed that the improvement in dispersion obtained by using the mixture of castor oil with healthy oils helps the delivery of these more desired oils when placed on the ocular surface in treatment of dry eye.

An additional benefit in using the above blend or mixture of oils is the reduction of viscosity of castor oil when combined with other less viscous oils. Surprisingly this drop in viscosity was found to be non linear and allows for selection of a formula of oil mixtures with improved spreading and lower viscosity which is favorable for use in treatment of dry eye.

The oil mixtures of this invention comprise at least 5 by weight castor oil preferably at least 20 by weight castor oil. In particular the oil mixtures of this invention comprise from 5 to 80 by weight castor oil and from 20 to 95 by weight of another oil selected from the group of healthy oils or food oils e.g. an oil selected from the group consisting of soybean oil olive oil safflower oil corn oil sesame oil peanut oil and cotton seed oil more preferably from 20 to 80 by weight castor oil and from 20 to 80 by weight of said other oil.

Most preferably the oil mixture of this invention comprises from 5 to 50 by weight castor oil and from 50 to 95 by weight of soybean oil or the oil mixture of this invention comprises from 20 to 80 by weight castor oil and from 20 to 80 by weight olive oil e.g. the oil mixture of this invention may comprise 70 by weight castor oil and 30 by weight olive oil

The oil mixture is preferably delivered to the eye in the form of an emulsion including a micro emulsion or a dispersion of said oil in a continuous aqueous phase i.e. as an emulsion comprising from about 0.1 to 50 by weight oil and from 99.9 to 50 by weight of the aqueous phase more preferably from about 0.1 to about 30 by weight oil and from about 99.9 to 70 by weight of the aqueous phase e.g. about 0.25 by weight oil and about 99.75 by weight of the aqueous phase.

The emulsions of this invention may be prepared according to methods known in the art. For example emulsions may be prepared by methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 649 047 4 839 342 and 5 411 952 wherein emulsions of castor oil are disclosed. That is the emulsions of this invention are prepared by the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 649 047 4 839 342 and 5 411 952 wherein the above oil mixtures are substituted for castor oil. Such patents are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

As disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 649 047 4 839 342 and 5 411 952 said emulsions of castor oil are disclosed as vehicles for cyclosporine. Similarly the oil mixtures of the present invention may be used as vehicles for cyclosporine. Such patents are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

In addition U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 979 discloses methods of preparing emulsions that are useful in treating dry eye. The emulsions of this patent are prepared by use of surfactants and dispersing agents which are especially suitable for preparing the emulsions of this invention. Such patent is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Finally US Patent Application Publication Number US2006 0106104 A1 discloses ophthalmic compositions which include compatible solute components for example tonicity components such as polyols and amino acids and in particular glycerin glycerol erythritol and carnitine. The ophthalmic compositions of this published patent application are useful for treating eyes that are exposed to hypertonic insult and also in a method of improving the visual acuity of a person in need thereof which comprises topically administering to said person in an effective amount said ophthalmic composition comprising a mixture of castor oil dispersed in an aqueous carrier component and an effective amount of a tonicity component comprising a material selected from a combination of compatible solute agents. For example said combination of compatible solute agents may comprise two polyol components and one amino acid component and wherein said polyol components may be erythritol and glycerol and said amino acid component may be carnitine. In the embodiment of the present invention wherein the compositions include the tonicity components disclosed in the published patent application and in particular when the tonicity components are erythritol glycerol and carnitine the compositions of this invention are useful for treating eyes that are exposed to hypertonic insult Similarly these tonicity components and preferably glycerin erythritol and carnitine may be included in the emulsions of this invention to provide an ophthalmic composition which may be applied topically to improve visual acuity. Such patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

As disclosed below the emulsion compositions of this invention may be manufactured with and without tonicity components such as glycerin erythritol carnitine etc.

Part 2 an aqueous phase containing purified water polysorbate 80 and glycerin. Part 2 is sterile filtered using a sterile Nalgene filtration unit with a 0.2 m PES membrane.

Part 3 an aqueous polymer dispersion containing purified water and Pemulen TR 2 5 Stock solution 0.5 . Part 3 is sterilized by autoclaving at 121 C. for 15 minutes at 15 psig.

Part 4 an aqueous polymer dispersion containing purified water and sodium carboxymethylcellulose. 5 Stock solution 2.5 . Part 4 is sterilized by autoclaving at 121 C. for 15 minutes at 15 psig.

Part 5 an aqueous phase containing purified water erythritol levocarnitine boric acid Sodium Hydroxide pH adjustment and purite preservative . Part 5 is sterile filtered using a sterile Nalgene filtration unit with a 0.2 m PES membrane. Part 5 can be modified based on formulation vehicle see Table 1.

Procedure Part 1 is added to Part 2 and the mixture is homogenized at 60 70 C. for 60 minutes at 14 15 Krpm. Part 1 and Part 2 is mixed using a Polytron PT 3100 homogenizer with a rotostator style tool 30 mm head . The homogenizing step takes place in a laminar flow hood as do all subsequent manufacturing steps. The premix is cooled to 30 C. and Part 3 is added while mixing at low speed using a magnetic stir bar. Part 4 is then added while similarly mixing at a slow speed using a magnetic stir bar. Part 5 is added under light protection using a similar mode of mixing. The emulsion protected from light from this point forward is mixed at a low speed for a specified period of time 30 minutes to form the final bulk emulsion.

The mixture of oils used in the ophthalmic compositions of this invention may be evaluated as described in Example 2 below.

Using the above procedure the following oils and mixtures of oils are tested and the results reported in Table 3 below.

As shown in Table 2 The addition of minor amounts of castor oil to an oil which does not spread on a model of the an ocular surface causes the spreading across ocular surface. In particular the addition of as little as 5 by weight castor oil to soybean oil causes the spreading of the resulting oil mixture across ocular surface. The addition of as little as 20 by weight castor oil to olive oil causes the spreading of the resulting oil mixture across ocular surface.

The ophthalmic compositions of the present invention were evaluated in an in vivo study as described in Example 3 below.

A 1 day ocular tolerability study of an emulsion comprising 0.25 by weight of a 70 30 castor oil olive oil mixture manufactured according to Example 1 was conducted in rabbits. The oil mixture was utilized as a vehicle for the tonicity components carnitine glycerine and erythritol. Female New Zealand White rabbits 5 rabbits group were given one drop 40 L each drop of said emulsion of or a marketed comparator eye drop comprising 1.25 by weight castor oil emulsified in an aqueous phase by topical ocular instillation in the left eye OS 6 times daily approximately 1 hr intervals for one day. The contralateral right eye OD served as a control without eye drop instillation. The following parameters were evaluated viability clinical observations ocular discomfort gross ocular observations irritation and ophthalmic examination slit lamp biomicroscopy pupillary reflex . Ocular instillation of the emulsion of the invention caused a minimal discomfort response with duration of up to 30 sec 70 frequency or 30 to 60 sec 7 frequency . The comparator eye drop caused a minimal discomfort response with duration of up to 30 sec 57 frequency or 30 to 60 sec 13 frequency . There were no effects of ocular instillation of the above emulsion on gross ocular observations irritation . The comparator eye drop caused mild 1 or moderate 2 conjunctival congestion hyperemia with 50 or 3 frequency respectively. In conclusion the emulsion of this invention caused equivalent minimal transient discomfort and significantly less mild conjunctival hyperemia compared to a marketed comparator eye drop.

The viscosity of mixtures of the oils used in the compositions and method of this invention were determined as described in Example 4 below.

Mixtures of Castor oil and olive oil were prepared and the viscosities thereof were determined The results are reported in . As shown. The change in viscosity is nonlinear i.e. discontinuous. Surprisingly small amounts of olive oil reduce the viscosity to a greater extent then larger amounts. That is 10 and 20 by weight olive oil reduces the viscosity of castor oil from 675 cps to 510 cps and 390 cps at 25 C. respectively and from 305 cps to 230 cps and 195 cps at 37 C. respectively. By comparison 60 and 40 by weight olive oil further reduces the viscosity of castor oil to 105 cps and 95 cps at 37 C. respectively and 220 cps and 150 cps at 25 C. respectively Thus the advantages of using castor oil alone while substantially reducing the viscosity thereof is obtained by the addition of small amounts of another oil e.g. olive oil.

The compositions of the invention can be administrated topically to various mammalian species suffering from dry eye e.g. humans cats dogs and the like in an effective amount to relieve the symptoms of dry eye as needed or on a regimen in single or 2 to 4 daily doses.

The foregoing description details specific methods and compositions that can be employed to practice the present invention and represents the best mode contemplated. While the above invention has been described with reference to the compositions above the oils described below may be included within the scope of this invention 

In addition the above mixtures of castor oil with a healthy oil may be advantageously used in combination with various tonicity improving compounds. In particular the combination of one of the oil mixtures described above with a tonicity component may be used to treat dry eye and improve the visual acuity of a person in need of said treatment by topically administering to said person in an effective amount an ophthalmic composition comprising said oil mixture dispersed in an aqueous carrier component and an effective amount of a tonicity component comprising a material selected from a combination of compatible solute agents wherein said combination of compatible solute agents comprises two polyol components and one amino acid component and wherein said polyol components are erythritol and glycerol and said amino acid component is carnitine.

Thus however detailed the foregoing may appear in text it should not be construed as limiting the overall scope hereof rather the ambit of the present invention is to be governed only by the lawful construction of the appended claims.
