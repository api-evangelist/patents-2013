This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 811 958 filed on Apr. 15 2013 entitled Subscription Based Social Media Platform the content of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety.

The present invention relates to computer based systems and methods for providing a subscription based social media platform.

Social media platforms utilize mobile and web based technologies to create highly interactive environments through which individuals and communities share co create discuss and modify user generated content. However some social media platforms limit the way by which a user can share content. For example some social media do not incorporate email phone calls or live video feeds in their supported technologies.

The present invention is directed to systems and methods for implementing subscription based social media. The disclosed system includes a robust subscription based publishing platform that enables sharing of premium content in one place for example photos videos SMS messages email phone calls live videos and more using an application app running on a mobile device. By using the disclosed systems and methods influential people and brands in the world can connect directly with their most devoted fans thereby building a true community.

A method for implementing a subscription based social media platform is provided. The method includes the steps of receiving an application programming interface API request for initializing a live stream from a mobile device the API request generated by an application running on the mobile device. The method also includes storing metadata information of the received API request in a database coupled to the server and sending a REpresentational State Transfer REST request to an encoding service provider the REST request comprising a request for a plurality of bitrate Real Time Messaging Protocol RTMP stream configurations. The method further includes receiving an RTMP protocol location from the encoding service provider storing RTMP stream information in the database sending the RTMP protocol location to the mobile device receiving a first notification from the mobile device that the mobile device has initiated the live stream and sending a second notification to the database that the mobile device has initiated the live stream.

Under alternative embodiments of the present invention a method for implementing a subscription based social media platform includes the steps of sending to a server an application programming interface API request for initializing a live stream the API request generated by an application running on the mobile device the API having metadata information being stored to a database and receiving a REpresentational State Transfer REST protocol location by the server in response to an REST request to an encoding service provider the REST request comprising a request for a plurality of bitrate Real Time Messaging Protocol RTMP stream configurations. The method further includes the steps of sending a first notification to the server that the mobile device has initiated the live stream encoding the live stream generating packets of encoded live stream data from the encoded live stream and sending the encoded live stream packets to an encoding service provider.

Under alternative embodiments of the present invention a method for implementing a subscription based social media platform includes the steps of receiving from a content creator a REST API request for initializing at least one of an email a short message service SMS message and a voice message and determining a plurality of subscribers with subscription to receive content from the content creator. The method further includes the steps of retrieving from a database information about the plurality of subscribers and a sending to an email service provider the REST API request information about the plurality of subscribers and the content from the content creator if the REST API request is a request for an email address b sending to an SMS message service provider the REST API request information about the plurality of subscribers and the content from the content creator if the REST API request is a request for an SMS message and c if the REST API request is a request for a voice message 1 sending to a content storage server an audio file corresponding to the content from the content creator 2 sending to an encoding service provider the REST API request and 3 sending to a voice service provider the REST API request in response to notification from the encoding service provider that the audio file is encoded.

These and other embodiments of the present invention will be described in greater detail in the remainder of the specification referring to the drawings.

The present invention is directed to systems and methods for implementing subscription based social media. The disclosed systems and methods build exclusive online communities for people of influence and their fans. The disclosed system includes a robust subscription based publishing platform with more ways to share premium content in one place for example photos videos SMS messages email phone calls live videos and more compared to existing platforms. By using the disclosed systems and methods influential people and brands in the world can connect directly with their most devoted fans by building a true community. Under an embodiment of the present invention the subscription based platform is advertisement free and spam free.

The encoding service provider returns an RTMP protocol location to the server and in response the server stores the RTMP stream information in the database and returns the RTMP location to the mobile device .

The app running on the mobile device then initiates the live stream and notifies the server that there is a stream initiating. Server then notifies the database for example using a flag that the stream has initiated .

The app running on the mobile device instructs the mobile device to start encoding and to send chunks of the video data to the encoding service provider or alternatively makes POST request to server for HTTP Live Streaming HLS storage . The encoding service provider encodes the video data into one or more streams. In addition the encoding service provider sends files for example HLS and or m3u8 files to a content delivery network CDN . The encoding service provider further repeats the RTMP stream to a CDN RTMP ingestion service .

Server looks up users who are subscribed to particular services and are allowed to view a stream from mobile tablet or computer device and then sends push notifications or SMS to one or more mobile devices for alerting them about the live stream or post to social media for example Twitter or Facebook alerting that the live stream .

The system can reach particular users based on their geographic profile information therefore allowing geo targeting of users. When users subscribe to a particular service they can specify geographic information for example their country city of residence zip code or address. The disclosed system can use different technologies to reach a particular audience based on user provided geographic information. The disclosed systems and methods allow a content creator using an app running on their mobile device to connect to their members for example using an SMS message a voice call directly to the recipients phone and or an email. For example a content creator can 

The targeted communication can be based on for example the zip code from the user s profile and allows the content creator to geographically target exactly where to send each reach method.

Under an alternative embodiment an app running on a creator s mobile device sends an REST API request to a server with SMS message content . The server retrieves information on the users that are subscribed to receive content from the content creator . A database sends the mobile numbers of the subscribed users to the server . In response the server sends a REST API request to an SMS service provider with SMS content generated using the app running on the mobile device and the mobile numbers of the subscribed users . The SMS service provider sends to the subscribed users mobile devices an SMS notifying the users for example about a live broadcast from the content creator .

Under an alternative embodiment an app running on a creator s mobile device records and posts a REST API request to a server with an audio file for example an AAC Audio file . The server retrieves information from users that are subscribed to receive content from the particular creator . A database sends mobile numbers of the subscribed users to the server . The server sends the audio file to a CDN storage server and further sends a REST API call to an encoding service provider to convert the audio file from the CDN storage server .

In response the encoding service provider retrieves the audio file converts it to one or more files and stores the new file s in the CDN storage server . In addition the encoding service provider notifies the server that the audio file has been converted . In response the server sends a REST API call to a voice calling service with a list of mobile numbers to be called .

The voice calling service sends a request to the server asking for a location of the audio file that is to be transmitted to subscribed users and consequently retrieves the audio file from the CDN storage server . In addition the voice calling service calls the mobile numbers of the subscribers and plays the audio for example an mp3 file from the original source .
