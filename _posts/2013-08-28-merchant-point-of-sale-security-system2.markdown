The present invention generally relates to merchant payment systems and more particularly to a merchant point of sale payment system that may be purposed as a security system.

Merchants typically have physical locations such as for example brick and mortar stores where the merchant sells products and or services. Those merchant physical locations typically include point of sale POS systems having one or more POS devices for receiving payments from customers for products and or services and may include merchant assisted checkout computers customer self checkout computers tablet checkout computers mobile checkout computers mobile wearable customer engagement computers and or a variety of other POS devices known in the art. Such POS systems can be relatively expensive but are necessary to enable the merchant to receive payments from customers for their products and or services. Many merchant physical locations also include security systems to protect the merchant physical location from theft. Those security systems can include cameras and motion sensors for detecting unauthorized access to the merchant physical location and in some cases contact the police in response to a detected breach of security. Such security systems are also relatively expensive and may require professional setup and maintenance.

As discussed in further detail below there is a need for an improved security system that may be realized by repurposing a merchant POS system when for example that POS system is not in use which results in the reduction of costs for the merchant by negating the need to purchase and implement a separate security system.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

The present disclosure describes systems and methods for providing a security system. In one embodiment the security system is provided at a merchant physical location using a plurality of point of sale POS devices and other computing devices of the merchant that are located in the merchant physical location and that are used to help customers. For example POS devices and other computing devices such as tablet computers wearable mobile customer engagement devices desktop computers mobile payment accepting devices televisions and dedicated customer checkout devices may be provided at the merchant physical location and during operating hours at the merchant physical location those devices may be used for conducting payment transactions providing information to customers providing information about customers for assisting those customers and or providing a variety of other POS and other functionality known in the art. However because each of those POS devices may also include environment sensors such as cameras microphones accelerometers network communication devices and or a variety of other environment sensors known in the art the devices may be repurposed to provide a security system at the merchant physical location by monitoring the environment sensors for environment signals and analyzing those environment signals to determine whether a security breach has occurred after business operating hours at the merchant physical locations.

While the embodiment illustrated and discussed below is directed to the POS device security system located at a merchant physical location the teachings of the present disclosure may be applied to a wide variety of different physical locations in which a plurality of computing devices with environment sensors are used for a primary purpose but may be repurposed to provide the security system discussed below when not in use. For example a family home may include a variety of computing devices such as mobile phones laptop computers tablet computers desktop computers televisions etc. each of which may include one or more environment sensors that may allow those computing devices to be repurposed to provide a security system similar to the POS security system discussed below. Similarly offices restaurants warehouses and or other physical locations known in the art may include similar computing devices that may be repurposed according to the teachings discussed herein to recognize the benefits of a security system that reduces costs for its users because it is part of an existing computing system rather than a dedicated security system.

Referring now to an embodiment of a method for providing a POS security system is illustrated. The method begins at block where POS devices are provided at a merchant physical location. illustrates an embodiment of a merchant physical location that may be for example a grocery store a clothing store and or a variety of other merchant physical locations known in the art that includes a plurality of checkout POS devices and other computing devices. However as discussed further herein a variety of other physical locations that includes a variety of computing devices will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. The merchant physical location includes a plurality of walls that define the merchant physical location between them and an entrance such as for example a door that provides access to the merchant physical location . A plurality of product sections such as for example shelves racks and or a variety of other product display areas known in the art are located in the merchant physical location and include one or more products provided for purchase by customers. A plurality of POS devices are positioned around the merchant physical location and in the illustrated embodiments include a plurality of POS devices positioned near the entrance of the merchant physical location as well as a POS positioned at the rear of the merchant physical location . A plurality of peripheral devices are located in product sections and are in communication with at least one of the POS devices such as in the embodiments discussed below the POS device in the rear of the merchant physical location .

In some of the embodiments illustrated and described below any or all of the POS devices are relatively immobile checkout devices at which a customer may conduct a payment transaction in the merchant physical location to purchase products sold by a merchant. For example the POS devices may be operated by the merchant or representatives employees of the merchant or may be self checkout devices that may be operated by the customers. In some embodiments the POS devices may include mobile devices for conducting payment transactions such as for example a tablet computer running a payment application a mobile payment card processing device e.g. a mobile credit card reader a mobile phone a laptop computer and or a variety of other mobile devices known in the art. For example each of the mobile POS devices may include docking stations for charging the mobile device so that their POS functionality may be utilized anywhere in the merchant physical location and when that functionality is not being used those mobile POS devices may be docked. As such the positioning of the docking stations in the merchant physical location may be selected to optimize the security functionality as discussed below.

In some embodiments other computing devices may be included in the merchant physical location . For example wearable mobile customer engagement devices such as for example Google Glass available from Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif. may be used in the merchant physical location to allow a merchant to help customer and in some cases act as POS device in conducting payment transactions with customers and may be utilized in the POS security system described herein. In another example tablet computers or televisions that are not POS devices but that provide information to customers e.g. at an information kiosk in the merchant physical location during merchant business operating hours may be positioned around the merchant physical location and used in the POS security system described herein outside of merchant business operating hours. While a few examples of POS devices and other computing devices that may be located around the merchant physical location have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a wide variety of computing devices known in the art may be used in the security system discussed below without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

Each of the POS devices and other computing devices discussed above that may be utilized in the POS security system includes at least one environment sensor and in many cases include a plurality of environment sensors. Examples of environment sensors that may be included in the POS devices and other computer devices include cameras microphones accelerometers infrared sensors temperature sensors smoke sensors motion sensors and or a variety of environment sensors known in the art. Furthermore a plurality of POS devices and or other computing devices may operate together to provide environment sensors. For example wireless networking devices on the plurality of POS devices and or other computing devices may operate to detect changes in wireless signal quality for the POS devices and or other computing devices and those wireless signal quality measurements in different locations in the merchant physical location over time may be analyzed to detect motion discussed in further detail below. In another example speaker systems and microphone systems on the plurality of POS devices and or other computing devices may operate to detect motion by emitting a sound from a speaker on a first device and measuring that sound a received by the microphones on a plurality of second devices and those sound measurements in different locations in the merchant physical location over time may be analyzed to detect motion discussed in further detail below.

While a few examples of environment sensors have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a wide variety of environment sensors known in the art may be provided in the POS device and or other computing devices without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore one of skill in the art will recognize that many POS devices and other computing devices e.g. tablet computers mobile phones etc. may include the environment sensors discussed above already built into the device and as such the POS devices and or other computing devices are not specialized security devices but rather are devices with a primary non security purpose that may be repurposed due to their inclusion of environment sensors to perform the security functions discussed below.

As discussed above the peripheral devices in the illustrated embodiment are in communication with the POS device at the rear of the merchant physical location but other embodiments may include other peripheral devices in communication with any of the POS devices near the entrance of the merchant physical location . In a specific example the communication connection between the POS device and the peripheral devices is a wireless connection e.g. a Wifi connection a Bluetooth connection a Bluetooth low energy BLE connection and or a variety of other wireless connections known in the art that allows the peripheral devices to be positioned anywhere in merchant physical location or outside the merchant physical location but within the limits of the wireless communication connection. However in other embodiments POS devices may be connected to peripheral devices through wired connections e.g. a universal serial bus USB connection or other wired connection known in the art . As discussed below the peripheral devices may be used to extend the functionality range and or detection capabilities of the POS security system when the POS devices and or other computing devices available in the merchant physical location do not provide the desired security coverage. However in many embodiments the POS devices will provide sufficient security coverage in the merchant physical location such that the peripheral devices may be omitted.

The peripheral devices may include a variety of devices known in the art having one or more environment sensors similar to those discussed above with reference to the POS devices and or the other computing devices. For example the peripheral devices may be or have cameras microphones accelerometers infrared sensors heat sensors speakers smoke detectors wireless access points water or other moisture detectors and or a variety of other environment sensors known in the art. In some embodiments the peripheral devices may be dedicated environment sensors that include for example a smoke detector. In other embodiments the peripheral devices may be devices such as cameras that have been repurposed for the security system and include multiple environment sensors such as a camera and a microphone. As such a merchant may expand the functionality of the security system beyond that available with just the environment sensors included in the POS devices by communicatively connecting peripheral devices with desired sensing capabilities and appropriately positioning those peripheral devices in or around the merchant physical location . For example a merchant at the merchant physical location may connect a heat sensing and or smoke detecting peripheral device to a POS device for fire detection capability a water or moisture detecting peripheral device to a POS device for flood detecting capability etc. as those environment sensors may not be included in a conventional tablet computer mobile phone or other computing or POS device .

In some embodiments one of the POS devices may be a management POS device that communicates with the other POS devices to receive environment signals generated by the environment sensors from those POS devices and itself. In other embodiments a local computing device e.g. a desktop computer or other non POS device located in the merchant physical location is connected to the POS devices and acts as a management device to analyze environment signals generated by the environment sensors from the POS devices and their connected peripheral devices if present. Either of the management POS device and or local computing device may be operable to analyze the environment signals received from the POS devices and or its own environment sensors. Either of the management POS device and or local computing device may be communicatively connected to a network e.g. the Internet to transmit environment signals analyzed or not over the network to a remote management device discussed in further detail below. While a management device in the merchant physical location has been described in some embodiments each of POS devices may be connected to a network e.g. the Internet to transmit environment signals analyzed or not over the network to a remote management device rather than through a local management device in the merchant physical location .

An embodiment of a merchant physical location has been described that includes a plurality of POS devices having environment sensors positioned about the merchant physical location . However one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that the teachings of the present disclosure may be applied in a variety of other physical locations in which computing devices having environment sensors are used for a primary non security purpose. For example a business office may include a plurality of computing devices such as desktop computers laptop computers mobile phones etc. and those computing devices may be repurposed according to the teachings of the present disclosure to provide the security system described herein. Similarly a family home may include a plurality of computing devices such as desktop computers laptop computers mobile phones televisions etc. and those computing devices may be repurposed according to the teachings of the present disclosure to provide the security system described herein. Thus while the specific embodiment below is directed to a merchant physical location with POS devices a wide variety of modification to that specific embodiment is envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.

The method then proceeds to block where a payment transaction is conducted using a POS device. Each of the POS devices includes a non transitory memory storing instruction that when executed by one or more hardware processors in the POS device provides a POS engine that is configured to receive and transmit payment information for conducting a payment transaction associated with a purchase. Thus at block any or all of the POS devices in the merchant physical location may be used to transact a payment with a customer. For example during merchant business operating hours customers may enter the merchant physical location select products from the product sections and pay for those products at the POS devices . In some embodiment the POS devices are manned by the merchant or merchant employees hereinafter the merchant and the payment transaction is carried out by the customer interacting with the merchant and the merchant operating the POS device . In other embodiments the POS devices are self checkout devices that are operated by the customer to carry out the payment transaction. As such customer information product information payment information and or other payment transaction information may be presented to the POS device transmitted over a network to a payment service provider financial account provider and or other payment transaction provider and a payment authorization may be received over the network at the POS device authorizing the payment transaction and allowing the customer to purchase the product from the merchant.

Any of the environment sensors on the POS devices may be utilized during the payment transaction at block . For example a camera on a POS device may be used to capture images of a customer s face e.g. for facial recognition identification a payment device or instrument e.g. for reading an account number from a payment card etc. In another example a microphone on a POS device may be used to receive customer identification instructions to carry out the payment transaction and or other customer or merchant verbal commands e.g. using voice recognition software to facilitate the payment transaction discussed above. In another example an infrared sensor on the POS device may be used to detect counterfeit bills when the customer is paying for a purchase with cash. In another example a wireless communication device in the POS device may be used to transmit and receive information over the network. In addition environment sensors in the POS devices may not be utilized in the payment transaction at block . For example many computing devices such as mobile phones or tablet computers may automatically include accelerometers or other environment sensors for other uses of those computing devices but that are not utilized in a payment transaction.

The method then proceeds to block where environment signals are detected using at least one POS device. In some embodiments block of the method is performed outside of merchant business operating hours. For example the POS devices in the merchant physical location may be dedicated to performing payment transaction at block during merchant business operating hours and then may be repurposed to provide a security system outside of merchant business operating hours by performing blocks of the method as discussed below. As such instructions may be sent to each of the POS devices and other computing devices to transition those devices from payment and customer engagement functionality to security system functionality e.g. by a management device. However in other embodiment environment sensors on the POS devices may be used during merchant business operating hours to provide a security system at the same time as that POS device is used to perform payment transactions at block . For example some environment signals associated with a security breach such as a detected sound signal that matches a gun shot may be detected while the POS devices are being used to conduct payment transaction at block .

At block any of the environment sensors in any of the POS devices other computing devices and peripheral devices may be used to detect environment signals in and around the merchant physical location . Thus cameras in the POS devices may detect movement by for example analyzing images of a particular camera view that are taken at different times microphones may detect sound accelerometers may detect vibrations heat sensors may detect heat moisture water sensors may detect moisture water smoke detectors may detect smoke infrared sensors may detect movement and or a variety of other environment sensors known in the art may detect environment signals known in the art.

In addition groups of POS devices other computing devices and peripheral devices may detect environment signals by for example detecting movement via changes in a wireless environment based on sounds emitted by a first POS device and detected by other POS device etc. For example a plurality of POS device other computing devices and or peripheral devices may together operate e.g. by sending data to a management device to analyze the signal quality at different times in a wireless environment of the merchant physical location e.g. a Wifi wireless environment a Bluetooth wireless environment a BLE environment etc. to detect motion. In another example a first POS device other computing device and or peripheral device may emit an ultrasonic sound from a speaker that may be detected at different times by one or more other POS devices computing devices and or peripheral devices and that detection data may be analyzed by a management device to detect objects and thus movement e.g. from the changing location of objects .

While a few examples of the detection of environment signals at block have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that any variety of environment signals known in the art may be detected at block using the appropriate environment sensors either provided on the POS devices the other computing devices and or using specialized peripheral devices that will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to the method then proceeds to block where the environment signals are analyzed for a security breach. Referring first to an embodiment of a management device is illustrated that includes a display displaying a POS security setting screen . In an embodiment the management device may be a management POS device located in the merchant physical location a local management device located in the merchant physical location or a remote management device connected to the devices at the merchant physical location through a network. Thus the management device may be connected to each of the POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices in the merchant physical location either through a local network e.g. a Wifi network a Bluetooth network a local area network LAN etc. or a remote network e.g. the Internet to receive and provide the information on the POS security screen and other screens like it. Prior to block of the method the management device POS security setting screen and other setting screens like it may be used to provide security settings that define one or more environment signals that will result in a determination of a security breach at block .

In the illustrated embodiment the POS security setting screen includes a merchant physical location graphic that includes a plurality of POS device indicators and peripheral device indicators . In the illustrated embodiment each of the POS device indicators and the peripheral device indicators are positioned on the merchant physical location graphic relative to each other in a manner that is similar to their relative positioning in the merchant physical location . In one example the POS devices and peripheral devices include location determination devices e.g. Global Positioning System GPS devices that allow the locations of those devices to be determined and the relative locations of the POS device indicators and the peripheral device indicators on the merchant physical location graphic to be provided automatically by the management device . In another example the user of the management device may place the POS device indicators and the peripheral device indicators on the merchant physical location graphic such that the relative positions of the POS devices and peripheral devices in the merchant physical location are property indicated.

The POS security setting screen also includes a POS devices setting section that includes basic information and controls for each of the POS devices in the merchant physical location including for each POS device the illustrated embodiment an on off button that allows that POS device to be activated or deactivated for the security system a sensitivity that allows the detection sensitivity for that POS device to be adjusted and an advanced settings link that provides access to more advanced settings for that POS device. In the illustrated embodiment some of the POS devices have been deactivated due to for example their redundancy in the security system e.g. because they are close to another POS device with the same environment sensors and are thus not needed. while the sensitivity of the POS device in the rear of the merchant physical location has been increased e.g. because it is further away from possible break in points of the merchant physical location such as the entrance and or windows .

The POS security setting screen also includes a POS device section that may be provided for example in response to a user of the management device selecting the advanced settings link for a particular POS device in the POS devices setting section . In the illustrated embodiment the user has selected the advanced settings link for the POS device in the rear of the merchant physical location and the POS device section is displaying a plurality of environment sensors included on that POS device e.g. a standard camera an IR camera a microphone and an accelerometer in the illustrated embodiment details associated with those environment sensors e.g. a setting for the standard camera to capture 1 image every 10 second a setting for the infrared camera to capture an image if sound is detected a setting for the microphone of high sensitivity and a setting for the accelerometer of medium sensitivity in the illustrated embodiment . The POS device section of the illustrated embodiment also includes a section detailing the peripheral devices connected to the POS device in the rear of the merchant physical location and includes indications of the type of environment sensor provided on each connected peripheral device as well as the connection status of each of those peripheral devices.

While a simplified example of a POS settings screen has been provided for clarity of discussion and illustration one of skill in the art will recognize that the setting screen or other screens like it may be provided that allow any details of the POS devices and environment sensors to be adjusted and or programmed for the security system. In an embodiment specific readings or ranges of environment signals may be set using settings screens that will cause a security breach to be determined. For example particular sounds e.g. a gun shot breaking glass etc. may be provided or set that will result in determination of a security breach. In another example particular decibel levels may be set that will result in a determination of a security breach. In another example particular movement or vibration levels may be set that will result in the determination of a security breach. Other features included on the POS setting screen may include a security system activation time that the user may set based on for example when merchant business operating hours end such that the security system is activated regularly when it is known that the POS functionality of the POS devices will not be in use.

Furthermore detection signatures may be provided using POS security setting screens that will cause a detected security breach to be ignored. In an embodiment the POS security settings screen may allow the user of the management device to define detection signatures that include one or more environment signals that when detected will result in the determination of no security breach when a security breach would otherwise be determined. For example the user may define a detection signature that includes images of the merchant or merchant employees and one or more POS devices detects sound motion or other environment signals that indicate a person is in the merchant physical location at an unauthorized time one or more cameras on the POS or other computing devices may capture an image if that image includes the images of the merchant or merchant employees such a detection will result in a determination of no security breach. In such an example the POS devices or management device may include facial recognition functionality or object recognition functionality e.g. to recognize objects such as family pets such that a captured image may be compared to the detection signature to determine whether the captured image includes an image provided in the detection signature. In another example a detection signature may include an object minimum size that will result in a determination of a security breach which may be useful when the physical location includes a pet or other animals that may cause the detection of movement that is not a security breach. In another example detection signatures may include multiple environment signals such as for example facial recognition of a merchant or merchant employee along with a spoken word or phrase e.g. such that a merchant or authorized merchant employee entering the merchant physical location outside of business operating hours must speak a passcode in order to not have a security breach determined . While a few examples of detection signatures have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a variety of different scenarios exist where detected environment signals should not result in a determination of a security breach and those detection signals should fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

At block the environment signals detected at block are analyzed to determine a security breach. In an embodiment each POS device and or other computing device in the merchant physical location includes a non transitory memory that includes instruction that when executed by one or more hardware processors in the POS device cause the one or more hardware processors to provide a security engine that receives the environment signals from its environment sensors and that may analyze those environment signals to determine a security breach. In another embodiment a management device e.g. a management POS device a local management device in the merchant physical location a remote management device in the merchant physical location etc. includes a non transitory memory that includes instruction that when executed by one or more hardware processors in the management device cause the one or more hardware processors to provide a security engine that receives the environment signals from the environment sensors in the POS devices the other computing devices and or the peripheral devices and that may analyze those environment signals to determine a security breach.

In one example of block the environment signals analyzed at block result in a determination of a security breach based on detected motion. For example the environment signals analyzed at block may include images of the merchant physical location taken using cameras in one or more POS devices other computing devices or peripheral devices that include objects in different positions over time i.e. due to their movement such that a determination of a security breach based on movement is made. In another example the environment signals analyzed at block may include changing wireless signal quality in the merchant physical location received from wireless communication devices in one or more POS devices other computing devices or peripheral devices that that may be analyzed to infer movement of an object through the merchant physical location that effects the wireless signal quality over time such that a determination of a security breach based on movement is made. In another example the environment signals analyzed at block may include sound measurements made in the merchant physical location and received from microphones in one or more POS devices other computing devices or peripheral devices that that may be analyzed to infer movement of an object through the merchant physical location based on those sound measurements over time of an ultrasonic sound emitted by one of the POS devices such that a determination of a security breach based on movement is made.

In another example the environment signals analyzed at block may include sound recordings in the merchant physical location received from microphones in one or more POS devices other computing devices or peripheral devices that that may be analyzed to determine a sound in the merchant physical location that results a determination of a security breach based on a type of sound e.g. broken glass a gunshot etc. . In another example the environment signals analyzed at block may include may include multiple environment signals such as heat and or smoke measurements in the merchant physical location received from heat and or smoke sensors in one or more POS devices other computing devices or peripheral devices that that may be analyzed to determine a heat and or smoke in the merchant physical location that results a determination of a security breach based on a fire. In another example the environment signals analyzed at block may include moisture and or water measurements in the merchant physical location received from moisture and or water sensors in one or more POS devices other computing devices or peripheral devices that that may be analyzed to determine moisture and or water in the merchant physical location that results a determination of a security breach based on a flood.

In any of the examples above the analysis of the environment signals at block may include comparing those environment signals to security settings in a database to determine whether the environment signal or signals exceeds a threshold that results in a determination of a security breach. As such sound measurements or recordings over a particular decibel level e.g. indicative of breaking glass a kicked in door etc. heat measurements over a particular temperature e.g. indicative of a fire vibrations over a particular frequency or amplitude and or a variety of other threshold measurements known in the art may result in the determination of a security breach. While a few examples of environment signals that will result in the determination of a security breach have been provided above one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a wide variety of environment signals and analysis of those signals may fall within the scope of the present disclosure in the analysis and determination of the security breach at block of the method .

The method may then proceed to decision block where it is determined whether the security breach determined at block matches a detection signature. As discussed above a user of the POS security system e.g. a merchant may provide one or more detection signatures that include one or more environment signals that upon detection will not result in the determination of a security breach. At decision block the POS device s other computing device s local management device and or remote management device may compare the environment signals that were analyzed and resulted in the determination of a security breach at block and compare those to one or more environment signals included in one or more detection signatures in a database.

If at decision block it is determined that the environment signals that resulted in the determination of a security breach match the environment signals in a detection signature that security breach is ignored and the method proceeds back to block where environment signals are detected. In some embodiments ignoring of a determined security breach may result in its associated environment signals being recorded logged but with no corresponding security breach information or warning sent to a user of the POS security system.

Referring now to and if at decision block it is determined that the environment signals that resulted in the determination of a security breach do not match the environment signals in any detection signature the method then proceeds to block where security breach information is provided to a user. In the embodiment discussed below security breach information is provided to a remote management device for display to a user. However the security breach information may be provided to a storage system for later transfer to the user a local management device for later display to the user a mobile user device for immediate display to the user and or in a variety of other manners known in the art. Furthermore security breach information provided to the user may include screen shots short message service SMS messages multimedia message service MMS messages audio video and or in any other manner known in the art for transmitting security breach information.

For example a determination of a security breach based on environment signals from one or more POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices may allow for the determination of a location of the event that resulted in those environment signals. The location of an event that resulted in the determination of a security breach based on movement may be determined based on which POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices detected that motion based on a changing wireless signal quality as detected by a plurality of POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices over time etc. The location of an event that resulted in the determination of a security breach based on sound may be determined based on which POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices detected that sound the level of the sound measurement recorded by a plurality of POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices etc. The location of an event that resulted in the determination of a security breach based on heat measurements may be determined based on which POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices detected that heat the level of the heat recorded by a plurality of the POS devices other computing devices and or peripheral devices etc. While a few examples have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a variety of techniques for determining and displaying the location of an event detected by the POS security system that caused the determination of a security breach will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

The POS security viewing screen also includes an environment signal window that in the illustrated embodiment includes a camera view from one of the POS devices in the merchant physical location . In an embodiment the environment signal window may display the camera view from a camera on a POS device that detected the environment signal that resulted in the determination of the security breach. A change button is provided to allow a user of the management device to change the camera view of the environment signal window such that a camera view from a camera in a different POS device is displayed. The POS security viewing screen also includes a POS device status section that in the illustrated embodiment includes the current status of each of the POS devices. For example the POS device status section in the illustrated embodiment indicates that the POS device at the rear of the merchant physical location has detected motion via its connected peripheral device while one of the POS devices has not detected an environment signal two POS devices are deactivated one POS device has detected sound via a microphone and is currently recording that sound and another POS device has detected motion via a camera and is currently recording with that camera. Furthermore the POS device status section includes buttons to activate the deactivated POS devices as well as buttons to stop recording of sound and using a camera. While a few examples of security breach information provided to a user on a management device have been provided any environment signals detected and received from POS devices as well as other security breach information captured in the security system and or known in the art will fall within the scope of the present disclosure and may be provided to the user e.g. via the management device of at block .

A contact security button is also provided on the POS security viewing screen . In an embodiment a system database may include contact or alert information for security providers such as for example a private security company the police and or a variety of other security providers known in the art. Such information may be provided by the merchant included in the system by the system provider or searched for and linked to by the security system itself e.g. the security system may be configured to search for appropriate security provider contact information and save that information in the database . Thus in response to the determination of a security breach using the POS security system described herein e.g. such that the detected motion and sound illustrated in a user may be provided with the POS security viewing screen that details where the security breach was detected allows the user to select camera views sound or other environment signals being recorded or transmitted from the merchant physical location and to contact security if necessary.

The POS security review screen also includes an environment signal window that in the illustrated embodiment includes images captures by cameras in POS devices along with a next button that allows a user to review other images captures by that camera or other cameras in other POS devices. The POS security review screen also includes a detection log and a detection legend that details the detection locations and tracking indication in the merchant physical location graphic . Thus as can be seen using the merchant physical location graphic and detection log at 1 00 a.m. motion was detected and ignored e.g. based possibly on that detected motion resulting in an image being taken that matched an image in a detection signature at 3 15 a.m. a sound event was detected by two POS devices as indicated by detection location on the merchant physical location graphic and possibly based on a broken window between 3 16 a.m. and 3 30 a.m. motion was detected and tracked as indicated by the motion indication on the merchant physical location graphic at 3 20 a.m. a motion event was detected by one of the POS devices e.g. as indicated by detection location and possibly based on an accelerometer reading by the POS device due to movement of that POS device and at 3 29 a.m. a sound event was detected by a POS devices as indicated by detection location on the merchant physical location graphic and possibly based on a broken window or door . Furthermore images captured by the POS devices e.g. in response to the motion tracking may be browsed through by the user e.g. using the next button to retrieve more information about the security breach.

Thus systems and methods have been described that provide a POS security system that allows a merchant to repurpose a POS system to provide a security system for a merchant physical location by leveraging environment sensors included on the POS devices or enabled by the group functioning of the POS devices to detect motion sound heat smoke and or a variety of other environment signals that may be indicative of a security breach in the merchant physical location.
