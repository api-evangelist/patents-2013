This application is a continuation application of International Application No. PCT EP2011 070313 filed Nov. 17 2011 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 415 782 filed Nov. 19 2010 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.

The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy and or prophylaxis in a patient and in particular to inhibitors of TYK2 kinase useful for treating diseases mediated by TYK2 kinase.

Cytokine pathways mediate a broad range of biological functions including many aspects of inflammation and immunity. Janus kinases JAK including JAK1 JAK2 JAK3 and TYK2 are cytoplasmic protein kinases that associate with type I and type II cytokine receptors and regulate cytokine signal transduction. Cytokine engagement with cognate receptors triggers activation of receptor associated JAKs and this leads to JAK mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT proteins and ultimately transcriptional activation of specific gene sets. JAK1 JAK2 and TYK2 exhibit broad patterns of gene expression while JAK3 expression is limited to leukocytes. Cytokine receptors are typically functional as heterodimers and as a result more than one type of JAK kinase is usually associated with cytokine receptor complexes. The specific JAKs associated with different cytokine receptor complexes have been determined in many cases through genetic studies and corroborated by other experimental evidence.

JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon e.g. IFNalpha type II interferon e.g. IFNgamma IL 2 and IL 6 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK1 knockout mice die perinatally due to defects in LIF receptor signaling. Characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN IL 10 IL 2 IL 4 and IL 6 pathways. A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL 6 pathway Tocilizumab was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.

Biochemical and genetic studies have shown an association between JAK2 and single chain e.g. EPO IL 3 and interferon gamma cytokine receptor families. Consistent with this JAK2 knockout mice die of anemia. Kinase activating mutations in JAK2 e.g. JAK2 V617F are associated with myeloproliferative disorders MPDs in humans.

JAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain which is present in the IL 2 IL 4 IL 7 IL 9 IL 15 and IL 21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is critical for lymphoid cell development and proliferation and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency SCID . Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes JAK3 and JAK3 mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications e.g. transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis .

TYK2 associates with the type I interferon e.g. IFNalpha IL 6 IL 10 IL 12 and IL 23 cytokine receptor complexes. Consistent with this primary cells derived from a TYK2 deficient human are defective in type I interferon IL 6 IL 10 IL 12 and IL 23 signaling. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL 12 and Il 23 cytokines Ustekinumab was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In addition an antibody targeting the IL 12 and IL 23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn s Disease.

The term NSAID is an acronym for non steroidal anti inflammatory drug and is a therapeutic agent with analgesic antipyretic lowering an elevated body temperature and relieving pain without impairing consciousness and in higher doses with anti inflammatory effects reducing inflammation . The term non steroidal is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids which among a broad range of other effects have a similar eicosanoid depressing anti inflammatory action. As analgesics NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non narcotic. NSAIDs include aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen. NSAIDs are usually indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis inflammatory arthropathies e.g. ankylosing spondylitis psoriatic arthritis Reiter s syndrome acute gout dysmenorrhoea metastatic bone pain headache and migraine postoperative pain mild to moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury pyrexia ileus and renal colic. Most NSAIDs act as non selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase 1 COX 1 and cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 isoenzymes. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A . Prostaglandins act among other things as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. COX 2 inhibitors include celecoxib etoricoxib lumiracoxib parecoxib rofecoxib rofecoxib and valdecoxib.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in patients that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A tumor comprises one or more cancerous cells.

The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. Stereoisomers include diastereomers enantiomers conformers and the like.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of Formula I. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include both acid and base addition salts. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate and pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counter ion for example a dihydrochloride or diformate salt.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid carbonic acid phosphoric acid and the like and organic acids may be selected from aliphatic cycloaliphatic aromatic araliphatic heterocyclic carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids such as formic acid acetic acid propionic acid glycolic acid gluconic acid lactic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid malic acid maleic acid maloneic acid succinic acid fumaric acid tartaric acid citric acid aspartic acid ascorbic acid glutamic acid anthranilic acid benzoic acid cinnamic acid mandelic acid embonic acid phenylacetic acid methanesulfonic acid ethanesulfonic acid benzenesulfonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid salicyclic acid and the like.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium potassium lithium ammonium calcium magnesium iron zinc copper manganese aluminum salts and the like. Particularly base addition salts are the ammonium potassium sodium calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic nontoxic bases includes salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins such as isopropylamine trimethylamine diethylamine triethylamine tripropylamine ethanolamine 2 diethylaminoethanol tromethamine dicyclohexylamine lysine arginine histidine caffeine procaine hydrabamine choline betaine ethylenediamine glucosamine methylglucamine theobromine purines piperizine piperidine N ethylpiperidine polyamine resins and the like. Particularly organic non toxic bases are isopropylamine diethylamine ethanolamine tromethamine dicyclohexylamine choline and caffeine.

A solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of Formula I. Examples of solvents that form solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine. The term hydrate refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.

The term protecting group or Pg refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. For example an amino protecting group is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino protecting groups include acetyl trifluoroacetyl phthalimido t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl CBz and 9 fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl Fmoc . Similarly a hydroxy protecting group refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable hydroxy protecting groups include acetyl trialkylsilyl dialkylphenylsilyl benzoyl benzyl benzyloxymethyl methyl methoxymethyl triarylmethyl and tetrahydropyranyl. A carboxy protecting group refers to a substituent of the carboxy group that blocks or protects the carboxy functionality. Common carboxy protecting groups include CHCHSOPh cyanoethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethyl 2 trimethylsilyl ethoxymethyl 2 p toluenesulfonyl ethyl 2 p nitrophenylsulfenyl ethyl 2 diphenylphosphino ethyl nitroethyl and the like. For a general description of protecting groups and their use see T. W. Greene and P. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Third Ed. John Wiley Sons New York 1999 and P. Kocienski Protecting Groups Third Ed. Verlag 2003.

The term patient includes human patients and animal patients. The term animal includes companion animals e.g. dogs cats and horses food source animals zoo animals marine animals birds and other similar animal species. In one example patient is a human.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and or the mammal being treated therewith.

The terms compound of this invention and compounds of the present invention unless otherwise indicated include compounds of Formulas I stereoisomers tautomers solvates prodrugs and salts e.g. pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

Another embodiment includes a compound of Formula I or a stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof selected from 

The compounds of Formula I may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. In addition the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring both the cis and trans forms as well as mixtures are embraced within the scope of the invention. Both the single positional isomers and mixture of positional isomers e.g. resulting from the N oxidation of the pyrimidinyl and pyrrozolyl rings or the E and Z forms of compounds of Formula I for example oxime moieties are also within the scope of the present invention.

In the structures shown herein where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.

The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water ethanol and the like and it is intended that the invention as defined by the claims embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.

In an embodiment compounds of Formula I may exist in different tautomeric forms and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention as defined by the claims. The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

The present invention also embraces isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of Formula I include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine such as H H C C C N N O O O P P S F Cl I and I respectively. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements . Positron emitting isotopes such as O N C and F are useful for positron emission tomography PET studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples herein below by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Compounds of Formula I may be synthesized by synthetic routes described herein. In certain embodiments processes well known in the chemical arts can be used in addition to or in light of the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art e.g. prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser v. 1 19 Wiley N.Y. 1967 1999 ed. Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie 4 Aufl. ed. Springer Verlag Berlin including supplements also available via the Beilstein online database or Editors Katrizky and Rees Pergamon Press 1984.

Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2 for example 5 to 1 000 compounds or 10 to 100 compounds of Formula I. Libraries of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial split and mix approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formula I enantiomers diasteriomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

In the preparation of compounds of the present invention protection of remote functionality e.g. primary or secondary amine of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino protecting groups NH Pg include acetyl trifluoroacetyl t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl CBz and 9 fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl Fmoc . The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use see T. W. Greene Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis John Wiley Sons New York 1991.

Compounds of the invention may be prepared from commercially available starting materials using the general methods illustrated herein.

For illustrative purposes reaction Schemes 1 4 depicted below provide routes for synthesizing the compounds of Formula I as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be available and used. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below other starting materials and reagents may be available for substitution to provide a variety of derivatives and or reaction conditions. In addition many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art.

An alternative procedure is shown in Scheme 2 Method 2 wherein X A R Rand Rare as defined for Formula I. Synthesis started with commercially available 4 chloropyridine 7 which was deprotonated with LDA followed by quenching with DMF to provide aldehyde 8. 4 chloropyridine 3 carboxaldehyde 8 was treated with sodium azide to displace 4 chloride to give 9. When azide 9 was condensed with an aniline in the presence of TiCl the resulting imine intermediate was not isolated but was directly heated in toluene to effect ring closure that yielded 10. This was followed by N oxide formation with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of catalytic amount of methyl rhenium trioxide. Subsequently the N oxide was treated with POClor POBrto give chloride or bromide 11. Under Pd catalyzed conditions 11 could then be coupled to an amine or amide to provide products 5 or 6.

For some substrates the amine could be coupled with intermediate 11 through a SNAr type reaction in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride as outlined in Scheme 3 Method 3 .

Final products 5 or 6 could also be prepared according to Scheme 4 Method 4 . Intermediate 11 from Scheme 2 could be coupled with tert butyl carbamate via Pd catalyzed reaction followed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid to provide amino intermediate 13. Intermediate 13 could then be transformed to 5 via a Pd catalyzed coupling reaction with an aryl or heteroaryl chloride or bromide. The amino intermediate 13 could also be coupled to an acid chloride to give amide 6.

It will be appreciated that where appropriate functional groups exist compounds of various formulae or any intermediates used in their preparation may be further derivatised by one or more standard synthetic methods employing condensation substitution oxidation reduction or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation arylation heteroarylation acylation sulfonylation halogenation nitration formylation and coupling procedures.

In each of the exemplary Schemes it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereoisomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 Lochmuller C. H. 113 3 283 302 1975 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Irving W. Wainer Ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1993 .

Diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair Eliel E. and Wilen S. John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob 47 4165 1982 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO 96 15111 . By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase W. J. Lough Ed. Chapman and Hall New York 1989 Okamoto 513 375 378 1990 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.

Another embodiment provides pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments containing the compounds of the invention and a therapeutically inert carrier diluent or excipient as well as methods of using the compounds of the invention to prepare such compositions and medicaments. In one example compounds of Formula I may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH and at the desired degree of purity with physiologically acceptable carriers i.e. carriers that are non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends on the particular use and the concentration of compound and can range anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example a compound of Formula I is formulated in an acetate buffer at pH 5. In another embodiment the compounds of Formula I are sterile. The compound may be stored for example as a solid or amorphous composition as a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.

Compositions are formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular patient being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The effective amount of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations and is the minimum amount necessary to inhibit TYK2 kinase activity. For example such amount may be below the amount that is toxic to normal cells or the patient as a whole.

The pharmaceutical composition or formulation for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles plastic and glass sachets ampoules plastic bags metal cylinders and the like. The container may also include a tamper proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides copolymers of L glutamic acid and gamma ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid.

In one example the pharmaceutically effective amount of the compound of the invention administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01 100 mg kg alternatively about 0.1 to 20 mg kg of patient body weight per day with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg kg day.

Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration.

The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient administrative form e.g. tablets powders capsules solutions dispersions suspensions syrups sprays suppositories gels emulsions patches aerosols etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations e.g. diluents carriers pH modifiers sweeteners bulking agents and further active agents.

A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier or excipient. Suitable carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in e.g. Ansel Howard C. et al. . Philadelphia Lippincott Williams Wilkins 2004 Gennaro Alfonso R. et al. . Philadelphia Lippincott Williams Wilkins 2000 and Rowe Raymond C. . Chicago Pharmaceutical Press 2005. The formulations may also include one or more buffers stabilizing agents surfactants wetting agents lubricating agents emulsifiers suspending agents preservatives antioxidants opaquing agents glidants processing aids colorants sweeteners perfuming agents flavoring agents diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug i.e. a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product i.e. medicament .

The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried granulated mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound for example 5 400 mg of the invention in a suitable buffer solution e.g. a phosphate buffer adding a tonicifier e.g. a salt such sodium chloride if desired. The solution may be filtered e.g. using a 0.2 micron filter to remove impurities and contaminants.

Collagen induced arthritis CIA is an animal model of human rheumatoid arthritis RA . Joint inflammation which develops in animals with CIA strongly resembles inflammation observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA . Blocking tumor necrosis factor TNF is an efficacious treatment of CIA just as it is a highly efficacious therapy in treatment of RA patients. CIA is mediated by both T cells and antibodies B cells . Macrophages are believed to play an important role in mediating tissue damage during disease development. CIA is induced by immunizing animals with collagen emulsified in Complete Freund s Adjuvant CFA . It is most commonly induced in the DBA 1 mouse strain but the disease can also be induced in Lewis rats.

The T cell Dependent Antibody Response TDAR is An assay for immune function testing when potential immunotoxic effects of compounds need to be studied. The IgM Plaque Forming Cell PFC assay using Sheep Red Blood Cells SRBC as the antigen is currently a widely accepted and validated standard test. TDAR is an assay for adult exposure immunotoxicity detection in mice based on the US National Toxicology Program NTP database M. I. Luster et al 1992 Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 18 200 210 . The utility of this assay stems from the fact that it is a holistic measurement involving several important components of an immune response. A TDAR is dependent on functions of the following cellular compartments 1 antigen presenting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells 2 T helper cells which are critical players in the genesis of the response as well as in isotype switching and 3 B cells which are the ultimate effector cells and are responsible for antibody production. Chemically induced changes in any one compartment can cause significant changes in the overall TDAR M. P. Holsapple In G. R. Burleson J. H. Dean and A. E. Munson Editors 1 Wiley Liss Publishers New York N.Y. 1995 pp. 71 108 . Usually this assay is performed either as an ELISA for measurement of soluble antibody R. J. Smialowizc et al 2001 Toxicol. Sci. 61 164 175 or as a plaque or antibody forming cell assay L. Guo et al 2002 Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 181 219 227 to detect plasma cells secreting antigen specific antibodies. The antigen of choice is either whole cells e.g. sheep erythrocytes or soluble protein antigens T. Miller et al 1998 Toxicol. Sci. 42 129 135 .
