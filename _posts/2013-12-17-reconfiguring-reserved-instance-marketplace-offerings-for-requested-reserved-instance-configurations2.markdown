The advent of virtualization technologies for commodity hardware has provided benefits with respect to managing large scale computing resources for many customers with diverse needs allowing various computing resources to be efficiently and securely shared by multiple customers. For example virtualization technologies may allow a single physical computing machine to be shared among multiple users by providing each user with one or more virtual machines hosted by the single physical computing machine with each such virtual machine being a software simulation acting as a distinct logical computing system that provides users with the illusion that they are the sole operators and administrators of a given hardware computing resource while also providing application isolation and security among the various virtual machines. As another example virtualization technologies may allow data storage hardware to be shared among multiple users by providing each user with a virtualized data store which may be distributed across multiple data storage devices with each such virtualized data store acting as a distinct logical data store that provides users with the illusion that they are the sole operators and administrators of the data storage resource.

In many environments operators of provider networks that implement different types of virtualized computing storage and or other network accessible functionality allow customers to reserve or purchase access to resources in any of several different resource acquisition modes. For example a customer may reserve a virtual compute resource instance for a relatively long duration such as one year or three years or a customer may purchase resources for shorter terms on an ad hoc basis as needed. For some types of resource reservations at least a portion of the price paid by the customer may fluctuate over time in response to changing demand and supply of the resources within the provider network. The provider network operator may have to try to ensure that a number of potentially competing demands are met e.g. that all guaranteed commitments to clients such as long term reservations that have already been paid for are honored that the dynamically varying component of resource pricing does not get so high that customer satisfaction suffers that the provider s data center investment is justified by a reasonable level of resource utilization and revenue and so on. In business environments where clients may choose from among multiple providers for network based computing options provider network operators may wish to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction and customer retention e.g. by making resource acquisition easy and economical and by reducing the complexity of client resource budget management as much as possible. For example some provider network operations may offer customers the ability to resell reserved compute instances in a resale marketplace so that customers may adjust their acquired resources if they are less than previously forecasted.

While embodiments are described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments are not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit embodiments to the particular form disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope as defined by the appended claims. The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used throughout this application the word may is used in a permissive sense i.e. meaning having the potential to rather than the mandatory sense i.e. meaning must . Similarly the words include including and includes mean including but not limited to.

The systems and methods described herein may implement reconfiguring reserved compute instance marketplace offerings for requested reserved compute instance configurations according to some embodiments. Virtual computing resource providers may provide computing resources to clients users or other type of customers in the form of reserved compute instances e.g. a virtual machine acting as a distinct logical computing system that provides users with the illusion that they are the sole operators and administrators of a given hardware computing resource . Clients may reserve i.e. purchase or buy a reserved compute instance for a specified length of time. Reserved compute instances may be configured in many different ways such as based on performance characteristics e.g. utilization size capacity etc. or the length of time desired. In some embodiments a reserved compute instance may always be available to a client and thus reserved for the client s use. Thus clients may be able to procure computing resources according to their determined needs.

Clients who utilize virtual computing resources may take advantage of the flexibility with which new resources can be acquired. Resources can be quickly scaled to meet demand such as for a client implementing a fast growing web service. For example in some embodiments reserved compute instances may be purchased for a period of time term length to operate the web service with additional reserved compute instances purchased as needed e.g. as demand increases . Client needs however may change. If for example demand for the web service drops sharply off some reserved compute instances purchased to operate the web service may be underutilized and may no longer be needed by a client. In various embodiments a virtual computing resource provider may implement a resale marketplace which may be in addition to an initial sale marketplace for the client to resell unwanted reserved compute instances for which a term of use ownership is still remaining. In this way clients may recoup some investments in computing resources that would otherwise be lost if the resources remained underutilized.

A resale computer resource marketplace implemented by a virtual computing resource provider may in various embodiments maintain listings of reserved compute instances for resale by their respective current owners resellers . Clients seeking to reserve purchase additional computing resources may choose search browse or otherwise ascertain the reserved compute instances available for resale in the resale marketplace. These potential buyers however may have desired configurations of reserved compute instances which satisfy their own computing resource needs. If for example a specified buyer desires a reserved compute instance with at least 7 months remaining in the term length and the only reserved compute instances listed as available for resale are for term lengths of 5 months or less then the potential buyer may procure the reserved instance from an initial sale marketplace which may offer standardized term lengths e.g. 1 month 6 months 1 year etc. . . . which at least may satisfy the desired configuration. For resellers especially those with uncommon or less desirable configurations of reserved compute instances the opportunities for recouping resource expenditures may not be very numerous.

In various embodiments virtual computing resource providers may implement various techniques to introduce more flexibility into resale transactions for reserved compute instances. For instance reserved compute instances may be reconfigured to meet standardized configurations similar to the offerings of an initial sale marketplace in some embodiments which may allow resellers to compete for buyers who would have resorted to purchasing a standardized reserved compute instance from the initial sale marketplace. Reseller flexibility may also be introduced by allowing reconfigurations more tailored to meet potential buyers wants or needs. is a diagram illustrating a virtual computing resource provider that provides reconfigurable reserved compute instance marketplace offerings to clients requesting a specified instance configuration according to some embodiments.

A virtual computing resource provider may offer a variety of computing resources clients customers or users in some embodiments. Such resources may include different types of compute instances such as reserved compute instances . Reserved compute instances may be initially reserved purchased or otherwise acquired for length of time from virtual computing resource provider to perform various client operations. Some clients however may wish to resell reserved compute instances for various reasons. Thus reserved compute instances may be listed for sale in resale marketplace . A client may be any type of computing system or device such as computing system described below with regard to configured to communicate with virtual computing resource provider . Client may in various embodiments facilitate interactions for a customer or buyer and resale marketplace .

Virtual computing resource provider may implement a resource manager which may be one or more various servers or computing devices such as computing system described below with regard to . Resource manager may perform various functions to handle both the reservation purchase of reserved compute instances as well as the management of reserved compute instances . In some embodiments virtual computing resource provider may implement a management database that maintain among other information listings of reserved compute instances available for resale.

As illustrated in client may send a request for resale listings of reserved compute instances with a specified instance configuration to resource manager . The specified configuration may include a variety of different attributes including but not limited to term length size or performance capacity type e.g. specific purpose such as optimized for graphics processing memory storage etc. . . . or a type of use such as heavy medium or light utilization type of software or other applications running on the reserved compute instance e.g. a specific operating system or a location e.g. particular data center availability zone or geographic region . Resource manager may obtain listings of reserved compute instances available for resale such as by requesting listings of reserved compute instances available for resale from management database maintaining the listings.

Once listings have been obtained such as receiving the listings from management database reserved compute instances that are reconfigurable to satisfy the specified configuration may be identified and modified listings created describing the reconfigurable reserved compute instances that satisfy the specified configuration. For example in various embodiments the reserved computed instances available for resale may be evaluated to determine whether one or more different types of reconfiguration operations may be performed to change the configuration of the reserved compute instance to satisfy the specified configuration. Modification operations may be one type of reconfiguration operation performed to reconfigure a reserved compute instance that may not incur any additional cost to virtual computing resource provider e.g. moving a reserved compute instance from one availability zone to another . Upgrade operations may be one type of reconfiguration operation performed to reconfigure a reserved compute instance that may incur additional cost to virtual computing resource provider e.g. upgrading to a higher utilization type of instance . Downgrade operations may be one type of reconfiguration operation performed to reconfigure a reserved compute instance that may leave a residual resource value to virtual computing resource provider e.g. moving a reserved compute instance to a cheaper data center . Various other reconfigurations such as adjusting the term length either to a standardized offering or a customized length may also be performed. Reserved compute instances may be partially reconfigured e.g. a remainder of the term or a remainder of the computing resource is not needed to satisfy the specified configuration . Reserved compute instances may be combined with others e.g. virtual machines implementing the reserved compute instance may be expanded to include physical hardware implementing by another reserved compute instance into the same virtual machine or broken apart into smaller reserved compute instances e.g. a large reserved compute instance offering 4 virtual cpu cores may be broken apart into 4 small reserved compute instances each offering 1 virtual cpu core .

Modified listings describing a reserved compute instance that satisfies the specified configuration information may be made for these identified reconfigurable reserved compute instances and included in resale listings for reserved compute instances provided to client . A list price which may be different than a reseller asking price initially provided by the reseller may be determined for a modified listing based at least in part on various factors such as costs to perform reconfiguration a current value of the reserved compute instance or similar resources or the seller s asking price in various embodiments. In at least some embodiments all of the provided listings may be modified listings. Authorization for reconfiguring the reserved compute instance may also be obtained from resellers such as for partial sales due to partial reconfigurations . In some embodiments authorization may not be obtained e.g. where partial sale is not necessary . From the perspective of client modified listings may not appear any different or be designated or identified in any way from resale listings that are not reconfigurable reserved compute instances.

Client in some embodiments may send a reservation request for a modified listing e.g. in order to purchase reserve it for use to resource manager . Resource manager may then perform reconfiguration operations to reconfigure the reserved compute instance in the modified listing or multiple reserved compute instances as in the case where reconfiguration involves combining . Please note that in various embodiments reconfiguration of reserved compute instances may not be reconfiguration of the specific reserved compute instance or instances but may be one or more other reserved compute instances available. Reconfiguration may be a reconfiguration of a pricing agreement to use a reserved compute instance or instances of the specified configuration. Resource manager may receive an indication that funds for the modified reservation equivalent to the list price have been received for virtual computing resource provider . Resource manager may also transfer funds equivalent to the reseller asking price or a prorated amount of the reseller asking price such as if there was only a partial sale to an account for the reseller. Resource manager may provide access to the reconfigured reserved compute instance to client and client or another client system or device may then access the reconfigured reserved compute instance .

Modified listings for reconfigurable reserved compute instances may serve as inputs to various other systems modules or devices for virtual computing resource provider . For example in some embodiments virtual computing resource provider may provide client recommendations to purchase reserve particular listings of reserved compute instances e.g. according to an optimization goal for the client like price or performance . Modified listings may also be provided for price alternatives such as in a comparison graphical user interface generated for display by client to a user in some embodiments.

Please note that previous descriptions are not intended to be limiting but are merely provided as an example of reconfigurable reserved compute instance marketplace offerings according to requested reserved compute instance configurations. Various other components may store listing information generating modified listings or communicate with a client. Other differences for example such as the number of clients or the number of available reserved compute instances may also be different than illustrated in .

This specification begins with a general description of a virtual computing resource provider which may implement reconfiguring reserved compute instance marketplace offerings for requested reserve compute instance configurations. Then various examples of a virtual computing resource provider are discussed including different components modules or arrangements of components module that may be employed as part of implementing a virtual computing resource provider. A number of different methods and techniques to implement reconfiguring reserved compute instance marketplace offerings for requested reserve compute instance configurations are then discussed some of which are illustrated in accompanying flowcharts. Finally a description of an example computing system upon which the various components modules systems devices and or nodes may be implemented is provided. Various examples are provided throughout the specification.

Compute instances may be many different types or configurations based on several different dimensions in some embodiments and pricing policies associated with different classes may differ. Compute instances in some embodiments may be classified based in part on the timing or duration of instance allocations i.e. on when instances are obtained by clients and when they are released by the clients such as reserved instances such as instances C D G H P Q T and U or on demand instances and spot instances such as A B E F R V S and W each with respective pricing policies. In some embodiments reserved compute instances may be reserved for fairly long periods such as a one year term or a three year term in accordance with the pricing policy by paying a low one time upfront payment for the instance and then paying a low hourly rate for actual use of the instance at any desired times during the term of the reservation. Thus a client that reserved a reserved instance may by making the long term reservation be assured that its reserved instance will be available whenever it is needed.

For those clients that do not wish to make a long term reservation the client may instead opt to use on demand instances or spot instances . The pricing policy for on demand instances may allow the client to pay for resource capacity by the hour with no long term commitment or upfront payments. The client may decrease or increase the resource capacity used based on application needs and may only have to pay the hourly rate for the instances used. In some cases the per hour pricing for on demand instances may be higher than the hourly rate for reserved compute instances because the relatively long durations of reservations may provide a more stable revenue stream to the operator of the provider network than the potentially more dynamic revenue stream provided by on demand instances. Spot instances may provide a third type of resource purchasing and allocation model. A spot pricing policy may allow a client to specify the maximum hourly price that the client is willing to pay and the resource manager may set a spot price for a given set of available compute resources dynamically based on the prices clients are willing to pay and on the number of instances available to support the spot model. If a client s bid meets or exceeds the current spot price an instance may be allocated to the client . If the spot price rises beyond the bid of the client using a spot instance access to the instance by the client may be revoked e.g. the instance may be shut down .

In some embodiments compute instances have different types or configurations based on expected uptime ratios. The uptime ratio of a particular reserved compute instance may be defined as the ratio of the amount of time the instance is activated to the total amount of time for which the instance is reserved. Uptime ratios may also be referred to as utilizations in some implementations. If a client expects to use a reserved compute instance for a relatively small fraction of the time for which the instance is reserved e.g. 30 35 of a year long reservation the client may decide to reserve the instance as a Low Uptime Ratio instance and pay a discounted hourly usage fee in accordance with the associated pricing policy. If the client expects to have a steady state workload that requires an instance to be up most of the time the client may reserve a High Uptime Ratio instance and potentially pay an even lower hourly usage fee although in some embodiments the hourly fee may be charged for the entire duration of the reservation regardless of the actual number of hours of use in accordance with pricing policy. An option for Medium Uptime Ratio instances with a corresponding pricing policy may be supported in some embodiments as well where the upfront costs and the per hour costs fall between the corresponding High Uptime Ratio and Low Uptime Ratio costs.

Compute instance configurations may also include compute instances with a general or specific purpose such as computational workloads for compute intensive applications e.g. high traffic web applications ad serving batch processing video encoding distributed analytics high energy physics genome analysis and computational fluid dynamics graphics intensive workloads e.g. game streaming 3D application streaming server side graphics workloads rendering financial modeling and engineering design memory intensive workloads e.g. high performance databases distributed memory caches in memory analytics genome assembly and analysis and storage optimized workloads e.g. data warehousing and cluster file systems . Size of compute instances such as a particular number of virtual CPU cores memory cache storage as well as any other performance characteristic. Configurations of compute instances may also include their location in a particular data center availability zone geographic location etc. . . . and in the case of reserved compute instances reservation term length. The previous descriptions is not intended to be limiting but merely illustrative of the many different configurations possible for a compute instance provided by virtual computing resource provider .

Virtual computing resource provider a resource manager may be implemented to manage computing resources provided by virtual computing resource provider . Resource manager may implement any one of the various techniques described below with regard to in order to implement reconfiguring reserved compute instance marketplace offerings for requested reserved compute instance configurations. Virtual computing resource provider may be implemented by any combination of hardware and or software on one or more servers or computing devices such as computing system described below with respect to . In various embodiments resource manager may track or allocate resources between in use compute resources and available compute resources . Resource manager may maintain the compute resources so as to implement a marketplace for available compute resources . For example in various embodiments resource manager may implement an initial sale marketplace for available compute resources that are not currently reserved to a client such as instances R S V and W. Resource manager may also implement a resale computing resource marketplace for reserved compute instances such as compute instances D H P Q T and U that are either in user or available and listed for resale . Resource manager may be configured to access a resource management database to store manipulate or update information pertaining to management of the resources provided by virtual computing resource provider .

In various embodiments resource manager may implement a flexible set of resource reservation control and access interfaces for clients . For example resource manager may provide credentials or permissions to clients such that compute instance control operations interactions between clients and in use compute resources may be performed. Resource manager may also facilitate reservation interactions and resale interactions between clients and compute instances for resale or available in the initial sale marketplace for available compute resources . is a block diagram illustrating a resource manager for a virtual computing resource provider that provides reconfigurable reserved compute instance offerings to clients requesting a specified instance configuration according to some embodiments.

As illustrated in resource manager may implement a programmatic interface e.g. an Application Programming Interface API or a graphical interface e.g. via a web site or a set of web pages that allows clients to learn about select purchase access to and or reserve resource instances either from an initial sale marketplace or a resale marketplace. It is noted that at least in some of the various embodiments discussed below where an entity such as a resource manager is described as implementing one or more programmatic interfaces such as a web page or an API an interface module such as interface module of that entity may be responsible for the interface related functionality. In some embodiments an equivalent interface related functionality may be implemented by a separate or standalone interface manager external to the resource manager. Such an interface may include capabilities to allow browsing of listed reserved compute instances for resale or initial sale provide details and specifications of the different types or sizes of instances supported the different reservation types or modes supported pricing models and so on.

Resource allocation module may be implemented by resource manager in order to handle management activities related to compute instances such as resource reservations resource reconfigurations or client recommendations . Resource reservations module may handle client requests and reservations related to the various marketplaces for purchase compute instances such as the initial sale marketplace or resale marketplace. Various reservation requests either for listings initial sale compute instances or reserved compute instances available for resale may be received and processed by resource reservations module . Resource reservations may also handle the various pricing schemes at least for the initial sale marketplace in various embodiments. For example virtual computing resource provider may support several different purchasing modes which may also be referred to herein as reservation modes in some embodiments for example term reservations i.e. reserved compute instances on demand resource allocation or spot price based resource allocation. Using the long term reservation mode a client may make a low one time upfront payment for a compute instance reserve it for a specified duration such as a one or three year term and pay a low hourly rate for the instance the client would be assured of having the reserved instance available for the term of the reservation. Using on demand mode a client could pay for capacity by the hour or some appropriate time unit without any long term commitments or upfront payments. In the spot price mode a client could specify the maximum price per unit time that it is willing to pay for a particular type of compute instance and if the client s maximum price exceeded a dynamic spot price determined at least in part by supply and demand that type of resource would be provided to the client. During periods when the supply of the requested resource type exceeded the demand the spot price may become significantly lower than the price for on demand mode. In some implementations if the spot price increases beyond the maximum bid specified by a client a resource allocation may be interrupted i.e. a resource instance that was previously allocated to the client may be reclaimed by the resource manager and may be allocated to some other client that is willing to pay a higher price. Other purchasing modes or combinations of modes may be implemented by the resource reservations module in some embodiments. Detecting the receipt of funds for reservations as well as directing transfer of funds to resellers may be implemented at resource reservations module . described in detail below provides examples of different functions or techniques resource reservations module may implement for funds transfers. Resource reservations may also update resource management database to reflect changes such as changes in ownership client use or client accounts.

Resource reconfigurations module may be configured to perform reconfigurations to reserved compute instances such as those associated with modified resale listings generated by listing optimizations module . For example modification operations may be one type of reconfiguration operation performed to reconfigure a reserved compute instance that may not incur any additional cost to virtual computing resource provider e.g. moving a reserved compute instance from one availability zone to another . Upgrade operations may be another type of reconfiguration operation performed to reconfigure a reserved compute instance that may incur additional cost to virtual computing resource provider e.g. upgrading to a higher utilization type of instance . Downgrade operations may be one type of reconfiguration operation performed to reconfigure a reserved compute instance that may leave a residual resource value to virtual computing resource provider e.g. moving a reserved compute instance to a cheaper data center . Various other reconfigurations such as adjusting the term length either to a standardized offering or a customized length may also be performed by resource reconfigurations module . Some reconfigurations may be requested by a client while others may be performed behind the scenes such that client is unaware that a reserved compute instance has been reconfigured. Reconfigurations themselves may be performed in some embodiments by reconfiguring a pricing agreement for a reserved compute instance s in a resale listing.

In some embodiments resource manager may implement client recommendations module in order to provide recommendations for client reservation of reserved compute instances in the resale marketplace and or the initial sale marketplace according to an optimization goal. For example a client optimization goal may be lowest price with particular performance requirements. Client recommendations module may determine a reserved compute instance resale listing original or modified that may satisfy the optimization goal and or a particular configuration for a compute instance. Recommendations for compute instances may be made to clients by client recommendations module based on various information about the client such as client usage data. Various types of usage data sources from which the client recommendations module obtains usage data to develop its recommendations may be employed in different embodiments. In some embodiments where for example a client already uses some set of resource instances of the virtual computing resources provider provider side metrics agents deployed at various entities such as resource instances network devices and the like within the virtual computing resources provider may serve as usage data sources for the pricing optimizer. The types of usage information collected for a given resource or instance may include for example uptime i.e. the amount of time a resource instance was active or booted up CPU utilization memory utilization I O rates I O device utilization network traffic rates network device utilization the operating system in use the hypervisor in use various details of the software stack in use such as application server type and version and so on depending on the type of resource. Some or all of these may be used to generate client recommendations in various embodiments.

In some embodiments resource manager may implement a resale management module which may implement a resale marketplace for reserved compute instances. For example resale management module may process and or handle requests to create modify and or remove reserved compute instance listings. Resale management module may be configured to obtain listings or update listings information stored in resource management database . In some embodiments resale management module may recommend or assist resellers with recommended asking prices for reserved compute instances request or obtain authorization for performing reconfiguration on a reserved compute instance for sale whether whole and or partial reconfiguration or sale . A reseller may opt in to allow a resale management module to automatically reconfigure a reserved compute instance held by the client for resale on a resale marketplace according in response to a selection of a modified listing associated with the reserved compute instance held by the reseller. For example the resource manager may implement one or more programmatic interfaces such as web pages APIs or command line interfaces allowing clients to opt in for the reconfigurations both partial and or total . If and when the listed resource instance is resold e.g. when a different client reserves the listed instance the instance may be removed from the marketplace listing reconfigured according to the modified listing removed from the set of resources reserved for the current owner reseller and or assigned to the set of resources for reserved for the new owner buyer . In some embodiments a reseller may not be aware opt in or authorize reconfiguration of the reserved compute instance which may still be reconfigured if a modified listing including the reserved compute instance is sold.

Resale management module may be configured to provide listings to clients requesting resale listings. In various embodiments client requests for listings of available reserved compute instances may include a specified instance configuration using any one of the various configurations discussed above . Listing optimizations module may be implemented in various embodiments to identify reserved compute instances available for resale that can be reconfigured to satisfy a specified instance configuration e.g. particular type size location term length utilization ration or performance characteristic . Listing optimizations module may enforce various business rules or other policies limiting the types of reconfigurations. For example a reserved compute instance may only be resized to another reserved compute instance of the same type e.g. small general purpose instance to large general purpose instance . In another example a reconfiguration operation to move a reserved compute instance form one location to another may be restricted based on a policy that limits number reserved compute instances in a particular location. The various types of reconfiguration operations such as those described above with regard to reconfigurations module and below with regard to may also provide limitations as to whether a reconfiguration may be possible. Some reserved compute instances may be combined or broken apart as part of reconfiguration e.g. if 4 small instances equal 1 large then the 4 small may be reconfigurable to the 1 large instance .

List optimizations module may also be configured to generate modified listings for reconfigurable reserved compute instances available for resale. For example the listing may be generated to describe the one or multiple reserved compute instance that is reconfigurable with a configuration even though the reconfiguration has not yet been performed that satisfies the specified instance configuration. In some embodiments listing optimizations module may be configured to determine a list price for a modified listing such as described below with regard to .

Resource allocation module may in some embodiments implement dynamically resizable pools of compute instances that may be set aside for the different reservation types or modes e.g. long term reserved instances may be allocated from one pool on demand instances from another and so on e.g. within available resources pool in . As noted above in some embodiments the virtual computing resource provider may be a network organized into a plurality of geographical regions and each region may include one or more availability zones. Resource allocation module may be responsible for changes moves between or changes to availability zones. An availability zone which may also be referred to as an availability container herein in turn may comprise one or more distinct locations or data centers engineered in such a way that the resources in a given availability zone are insulated from failures in other availability zones. That is a failure in one availability zone may not be expected to result in a failure in any other availability zone thus the availability profile of a resource instance is intended to be independent of the availability profile of a resource instance in a different availability zone. Clients may be able to protect their applications from failures at a single location by launching multiple application instances in respective availability zones. At the same time in some implementations inexpensive and low latency network connectivity may be provided between resource instances that reside within the same geographical region and network transmissions between resources of the same availability zone may be even faster .

Turning back to clients may encompass any type of client configurable to submit requests to virtual computing resource provider including resale interactions reservation interactions and or compute instance control operations interactions . For example a given client may include a suitable version of a web browser or may include a plug in module or other type of code module configured to execute as an extension to or within an execution environment provided by a web browser. Alternatively a client may encompass an application such as a database application or user interface thereof a media application an office application or any other application that may make use of compute instances to perform various operations. In some embodiments such an application may include sufficient protocol support e.g. for a suitable version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP for generating and processing network based services requests without necessarily implementing full browser support for all types of network based data. In some embodiments clients may be configured to generate network based services requests according to a Representational State Transfer REST style network based services architecture a document or message based network based services architecture or another suitable network based services architecture.

In some embodiments a client e.g. a computational client may be configured to provide access to a compute instance in a manner that is transparent to applications implement on the client utilizing computational resources provided by the compute instance . In such an embodiment applications may not need to be modified to make use of the service model of . Instead the details of interfacing to virtual computing resource provider may be coordinated by client and the operating system or file system on behalf of applications executing within the operating system environment at a client .

Clients may convey network based services requests virtual computing resource provider via a network. In various embodiments a network may encompass any suitable combination of networking hardware and protocols necessary to establish network based communications between clients and virtual computing resource provider . For example a network may generally encompass the various telecommunications networks and service providers that collectively implement the Internet. A network may also include private networks such as local area networks LANs or wide area networks WANs as well as public or private wireless networks. For example both a given client and virtual computing resource provider may be respectively provisioned within enterprises having their own internal networks. In such an embodiment a network may include the hardware e.g. modems routers switches load balancers proxy servers etc. and software e.g. protocol stacks accounting software firewall security software etc. necessary to establish a networking link between given client and the Internet as well as between the Internet and network based services platform . It is noted that in some embodiments clients may communicate with virtual computing resource provider using a private network rather than the public Internet.

Resale client may send a resale request to resource manager . The resale request may indicate a particular one or more reserved compute instances currently held by resale client to be listed for resale in the resale marketplace. In some embodiments separate request may indicate an asking price for respective reserved compute instances and or may include an opt in for performing automatic reconfiguration to for resale specific to a specified compute instance configuration of a potential buyer. In some embodiments however an opt in to reconfiguration may not be sent. Resource manager may be configured to send authorization requests to participate in reconfiguration for resale to resale client . For example resource manager may send a partial reconfiguration authorization request to resale client in order to obtain authorization for a resale reconfiguration that does not sell all of the term and or resources included in the current listing for the reserved compute instance. Partial reconfiguration authorization or consent to any reconfiguration may be sent back to resource manager . Upon sale of the listing whether reconfigured or originally configured a resale notification may be sent from resource manager to resale client . Other information such as funds transferred to resale client account the amount of funds e.g. full asking price or prorated share and other sale related information may be included with resale notification .

A purchase client may send a request for resale listings with a specified reserved compute instance configuration to resource manager . The specified instance configuration may include one or more characteristics of a reserved compute instance such as term length size or performance capacity type e.g. specific purpose such as optimized for graphics processing memory storage etc. . . . or a type of use such as heavy medium or light utilization type of software or other applications running on the reserved compute instance e.g. a specific operating system or a location e.g. particular data center or geographic region . Resource manager may obtain the listings including modified listings according to the various techniques described below with regard to and send resale listings including modified listings for reconfigurable reserved instances back to purchase client . These listings may take the form of information html or other code which purchase client may use to display a listing such as in a GUI window or web page to a user of purchase client in some embodiments. Based on the listings purchase client may identify one or more listings to reserve purchase and send a reserve instance reservation request to resource manager . If the reservation request is successful e.g. a requested listing has not been purchased by another client then a reservation response indicating success may be sent. Such a response may include access information for purchase client to use the reserved instance. A failure indication may be sent as the response if the reservation did not successfully complete e.g. payment problem .

The examples of reconfiguring reserved compute instance marketplace offerings for requested reserved compute instance configurations discussed above with regard to have been given in regard to a virtual computing resource provider. Various other types or combinations of systems may implement these techniques. For example recommendation service may provide purchase recommendations to a client and request that a virtual computing resource provider make the requested reconfigurations. is a high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for reconfiguring reserved compute instance marketplace offerings for requested reserved compute instance configurations according to some embodiments. These techniques may be implemented using a resource manager or other component of virtual computing resource provider as described above with regard to as well as otherwise configured reserved compute instance resale marketplaces that may implement the described techniques.

As indicated at a request for listings of reserved compute instances available for resale that satisfy a specified instance configuration may be received in various embodiments. The configuration may specify some or all of the various components of reserved compute instance configuration such as term length size or performance capacity type e.g. specific purpose such as optimized for graphics processing memory storage etc. . . . or a type of use such as heavy medium or light utilization type of software or other applications running on the reserved compute instance e.g. a specific operating system or a location e.g. particular data center or geographic region . The specified instance configuration may in some embodiments provide a set of acceptable attributes e.g. medium or high utilization or various combinations of reserved compute instances e.g. 1 large or 4 small .

As indicated at based at least in part on current configurations for reserved compute instances available for resale reserved compute instances available for resale that are reconfigurable to satisfy the specified instance configuration may be identified in various embodiments. For example a rules based engine applying reconfiguration policies may be employed to determine which combination of one or more reconfiguration operations may be performed to determine whether the specified configuration may be satisfied. As noted above in some embodiments the specified configuration may be multiple different acceptable configurations and thus identification techniques may be performed for each configuration. described in detail below provides further examples of various techniques for identifying reconfigurable reserved compute instances available for resale that satisfy the specified configuration. Reconfigurable reserved compute instances may be only partially reconfigurable leaving some remaining term length or remaining compute resource unsold in some embodiments. Reserved compute listings may also reconfigured as combination of two reserved compute listings in some embodiments.

As indicated at in various embodiments the listings of reserved compute instances available for resale that satisfy the specified instance configuration including modified listings for the identified reserved compute instances that are reconfigurable may be provided for reservation by a client. In some embodiments the modified listings may describe a reserved compute instance that is reconfigurable to satisfy the specified configuration as already reconfigured to have the specified instance configuration. Thus in some embodiments the purchaser is unaware that the listing is a modified listing. In some embodiments some provided listings may be original listings while others are modified. In at least some embodiments all of the provided listings are modified listings.

In some embodiments the listings may be provided as inputs to a cost optimizer or other client recommendation engine such that client recommendations may be determined by including the possibility of the reconfigurable reserved compute instances in the resale marketplace when optimizing for a client optimization goal. Listings may also be provided alongside information for initial sale pricing for reserved compute instances from an initial sale marketplace for reserved compute instances. For example a reservation request for a reserved compute instances with the specified instance configuration may be received and held while the resale listings may be provided to a purchase in order to provide alternative pricing information in some embodiments.

As indicated at in some embodiments a reservation request for one of the modified listings may be received. In response to receiving the reservation request at least one of the identified reserved compute instances described in the modified listing may be reconfigured as indicated at . For example if modified listing of a reserved compute instance with a 1 year term is requested then a 9 month term reserved compute instance associated with the modified listing may be reconfigured to have a 12 month term. Other reconfiguration operations such as modification upgrades and downgrades described in further detail below with regard to may be performed. Once payment is received in various embodiments access may be provided to the purchase for the reconfigured reserved compute instance.

As discussed above a reseller may first list a reserve compute instance for resale in a resale marketplace. is high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for listing a reserved compute instance for resale at a virtual computing resource provider according to some embodiments. As indicated at a request may be received to list a reserved compute instance for resale in various embodiments. The request may identify one or more reserved compute instances currently held by the reseller. As indicated at an asking price for the reserved compute instance to include in a listing for the reserved compute instance may be received. For example a sale price recommendation engine may provide a suggested sale price which a client may accept reject or modify and then send back a response including the asking price. As indicated at in some embodiments authorization may be received to reconfigure the reserved compute instance for inclusion in a modified resale listing. For example the reseller may opt in for either all reconfigurations total reconfigurations or partial reconfigurations. Then as indicated at the reserved compute instance may be listed according to the received asking price in various embodiments.

As discussed above in some embodiments only a portion of listed reserved compute instance for resale may be reconfigurable to be sold. is high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for determining whether a reserved compute instance listed for resale at a virtual computing resource provider that is reconfigurable to a requested reserved instance configuration can be included in a modified listing according to some embodiments. As indicated at a reserve instance may be identified as reconfigurable to satisfy a specified configuration in a request for listings that satisfy the specified configuration in various embodiments. A determination may then be made as indicated at whether the reconfiguration includes a sale of the entire reserved compute instance. If yes as indicated by the positive exit the reserved compute instance may be included in the requested listings. For example in some embodiments resale listings are authorized by default to reconfigure the reserved compute instance if the entire reserved compute instance can be sold. If not a determination may be made as to whether a partial sale of the reserved compute instance is authorized as indicated at . For example in some embodiments a reseller may authorize partial sales at the time of listing the reserved compute instance or at a later time. In some embodiments the authorization may include a minimum profit amount from the partial sale which may authorize only partial sales that would generate a profit to the reseller at or about the minimum profit amount. In some embodiments authorization may be requested in response to a reservation request including a partial sale of the reserved compute instance. Authorized partial sales as indicated by the positive exit to may include the reserved compute instance in the requested listings. Otherwise as indicated at the negative exit to the reserved compute instance may be excluded from the requested listings.

As discussed above reserved compute instances can be configured in many different ways. Listings of reserved compute instances available for resale may first be obtained. Those listings that already satisfy a specified instance configuration without reconfiguration may be easily identifiable. is high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for identifying reconfigurable reserved compute instances for a specified reserved compute instance configuration according to some embodiments. The techniques discussed below may be implemented to evaluate some or all of the available listings. Some listings may be excluded from the evaluation in some embodiments. For example listings from resellers that have not authorized reconfiguration for resale of their reserved compute instances.

As indicated at a reserved compute instance available for resale may be selected in order to evaluate whether it is reconfigurable to satisfy a specified configuration in various embodiments. Resale marketplace rules or policies may in some embodiments eliminate some listings that may otherwise be reconfigurable. Lack of authorization as noted above length of time listed recently listed insufficient remaining term length or specially priced e.g. originally discounted reserved compute instances are some examples of policies that might be used in various embodiments to exclude some listings from evaluation.

In some embodiments as illustrated at if the term length for the reserved compute instance is adjustable to satisfy the specified condition then the reserved compute instance is reconfigurable as indicated by the positive exit to . For example if the specified term length is 1 year and the listed term length is 9 months a three month adjustment to the term length may be made. Similarly if a 1 year term length is specified and a 14 month term length is listed a 2 month adjustment to remove the months from the term may be made. In various embodiments some term adjustment restrictions may be enforced. For example if a term remainder is less than a common term unit e.g. month or year then the term may not be adjusted and leave only the small remainder e.g. 10 days . Another example restriction may be that term adjustments can only be increases not decreases or that a term length can only be adjusted to a standardized term length such as may be offered by the initial sale marketplace 1 year 6 months etc. . . . .

Another reconfiguration determination may be made as to whether the reserved compute instance may be modifiable to satisfy the specified configuration as indicated at . If yes then the reserved compute instance is reconfigurable as indicated by the positive exit to . In various embodiments modification operations may be operations that do not incur a cost to the virtual computing resource provider. For example if the resource provider merely is changing metadata or affiliation information for a reserved compute instance e.g. relocating the reserved compute instance to a different availability zone in a same region or loading different software e.g. such as an operating system or application changing a network platform for the instance on the reserved compute instance then no cost may be incurred. Similarly a rearrangement of compute resources such as changing the instance type or size within a same instance family e.g. instances with the same purpose such as general compute storage etc. . . . may also be modifiable in various embodiments. Again as noted above some restrictions or policies may limit modifications such as modifications to a different instance type in a different instance family or a move to a different region may violate reconfiguration policies.

As indicated at another reconfiguration determination may be made as to whether a reserved compute instance is upgradeable to satisfy the specified configuration in various embodiments. If yes then the reserved compute instance is reconfigurable as indicated by the positive exit to . In various embodiments an upgrade operation may incur some cost to a virtual computing resource provider. For example the difference in configuration may be a difference in the utilization type of an instance e.g. from light to heavy . Changing to the new utilization type may incur a cost for the virtual computing resource provider e.g. different rate revenue less capacity etc. . . . . Another upgrade may be a location change between a less expensive location to more expensive location. Restrictions or policies may be applied to prevent otherwise performable upgrades. For example in some embodiments an upgrade cost limit may be imposed e.g. so that an upgrade is not so expensive that the cost cannot be recouped by a sale in the resale market .

As indicated at another reconfiguration determination may be made as to whether a reserved compute instance is downgradable to satisfy the specified configuration in various embodiments. If yes then the reserved compute instance is reconfigurable as indicated by the positive exit to . In various embodiments an downgrade operation may incur some residual resource value to the virtual computing resource provider. For example the difference in configuration may be a difference in the utilization type of an instance e.g. from heavy to light . Changing to the new utilization type may incur a residual for the virtual computing resource provider e.g. different rate revenue more capacity etc. . . . . Another downgrade may be a location change between a more expensive location to less expensive location. Restrictions or policies may be applied to prevent otherwise performable downgrades. For example in some embodiments a residual value limit may be imposed.

The various different evaluations at and may be performed in various orders with one or more other evaluations removed. For example reconfiguration may be determined if a reserved compute instances is either term adjustable or modifiable upgrades and downgrades may not be reconfiguration options . Moreover in some embodiments even if a reserved compute instance is identified as reconfigurable other policies such as a limit on the number of reconfiguration operations for a listing may be imposed to exclude the reserved compute instance. Thus the examples discussed above are not intended to be limiting as to the various other ways reserved compute instances may or may not be considered reconfigurable.

The reconfigurable reserved compute instances identified as described above with regard to may be associated with modified listings generated and included with listings sent provided for reservation by a client. As various pricing factors for the reserved compute instance may have changed either since the compute instance was first reserved by the reseller or listed by the reseller a determination may be made as to a new list price for the modified listing. is high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for determining list prices for modified listings to provide a client with for reservation according to some embodiments.

As indicated at in various embodiments a reserved compute instance available for resale may be identified as reconfigurable to satisfy a specified configuration in a request for listings of reserved compute instances available for resale in various embodiments. A list price may then be determined for a modified listing including the reserved compute instance may be determined as indicated at . In various embodiments the list price may be determined on various factors including but not limited to costs to reconfigure the reserved compute instance e.g. how much to upgrade downgrade downtime for the instance to perform reconfiguration a current value for the specified instance configuration e.g. at the initial sale market for reserved instance on demand or spot market value and or a reseller asking price e.g. may ensure that a fixed percentage over the reseller asking price is obtained for the reserved compute instance. In some embodiments a list price may include multiple elements. For example a reservation fee and a usage rate at for which the owner pays for usage e.g. by the hour . In some embodiments the original usage rate may be averaged with a new usage rate for the remaining time period e.g. based on current usage rates for the specified configuration of instance . Alternatively 2 rates for two different time periods may be listed in some embodiments.

As indicated at the determined list price may be included in the modified listing for the reconfigurable reserved compute instance provided for reservation by a client at the determined list price. In some embodiments the reseller may not be aware of or have veto power over the determined list price and whether or not it is included in the modified listing. Alternatively in some embodiments the reseller may approve a new list price e.g. in order to ensure that the new list price is competitive for resale . The modified listing itself may not in various embodiments break down the portions of the list price associated with or additions to the original asking price.

As discussed above a reserved compute instance resale marketplace provides resellers with opportunities to recover some costs for investing in unused compute resources provided by reserved compute instances. Modified listings may in various embodiments have a list price different from e.g. higher than an original asking price for the reserved compute instance prior to reconfiguration. Thus a determination may be made as to the amount of funds to provide the reseller in the event of a reservation purchase of a modified listing that is associated with a reserved compute instance listed by a reseller. is high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for transferring funds to a reseller for a modified listing that has been reserved according to some embodiments.

As indicated at a reservation request for a modified listing that describes a reserved compute instance reconfigurable to a requested compute instance configuration as configured to the requested compute instance configuration is received in various embodiments. In some embodiments the reservation request may include payment information and or authorization from a purchasing client. In some embodiments a payment protocol workflow or service may be initiated. For example a GUI interface may be generated at a purchase client at which payment information e.g. method account number etc. . . . may be entered and a transaction using the payment information processed. Or in some embodiments a billing service or system may obtain information previously registered for the purchase client and debit the list price funds. However performed an indication may be received that funds sufficient to satisfy a list price for the modified listing have been received as indicated at .

A determination may be made as to the amount of funds to be transferred to a reseller. For example it the entire reserved compute instance was sold then the amount to transfer may simply be the original asking price provided by the reseller from which a service fee may possibly be subtracted . More sophisticated determinations may be made if for example only a partial sale of the reserved compute instance occurred. For example if 6 out of 7 months were sold then a prorated portion e.g. 6 7 of the original asking price from which a service fee may possibly be subtracted . In another example if a reserved compute instance was downgraded to a lower utilization type then an estimated value on lost usage fees may be debited from the original asking price. Once determined an amount of funds based at least in part on the original asking price for the reconfigurable reserved compute instance may be transferred to an account for the reseller as indicated at . For example an account maintained for reserving compute instances at a virtual computing resource provider associated with the reseller may be credited with the funds.
