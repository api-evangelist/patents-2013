The present invention relates to access control lists in software development and more specifically to role based authorization for software products implementing a content space model.

Many software applications and software intensive systems rely on an authorization model called an access control list ACL . An ACL is a list of permissions attached to an object. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects as well as what operations are allowed on given objects. Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation. Role based authorization is used to determine for given function and user and perhaps other parameters whether or not the function is allowed. Typically users are associated with categorized by roles which are associated with Permissions and or Resources or instances . The ACL model in implementation typically has a relatively few Roles e.g. 10 or less and may have 1000s of Permissions and can have 100s or 1000s of Resources. In this model Permissions correspond to function. A product using role based authorization typically ships a set of default Policies that define default Roles and relate these to Permissions and Resources.

One of the ongoing challenges in each product release is to ensure that the default Policies are appropriately updated for changes in product the addition deletion or alteration of function and relating these to Permissions is a regular per release problem. As such for a given product release it has to be determined whether each Role has the correct list of permissions whether all the product functions and features covered by the right Roles whether the Resources associated with the correct Roles and the like.

Related to this determination is adequately testing at reasonable cost all the changes to the default Polices for each release. In addition when products are refactored within the product portfolio the previously separate security policies have to be integrated into a seamless coherent whole at reasonable cost and a high degree of assurance that nothing has been missed.

Exemplary embodiments include a computer implemented method for generating role based authorizations the method including collecting by a processor a plurality of permissions from an access control list creating by the processor a plurality of content space specification files that includes the plurality of permissions from an access control list processing by the processor the plurality of content space specification files to generate a plurality of access control list roles and outputting by the processor the plurality of access control list roles.

Additional exemplary embodiments include computer program product for generating role based authorizations the computer program product including a non transitory computer readable medium storing instructions for causing a computer to implement a method. The method includes collecting by a processor a plurality of permissions from an access control list creating by the processor a plurality of content space specification files that includes the plurality of permissions from an access control list processing by the processor the plurality of content space specification files to generate a plurality of access control list roles and outputting by the processor the plurality of access control list roles.

Additional exemplary embodiments include a system for generating role based authorizations the system including a processor configured for collecting a plurality of permissions from an access control list creating a plurality of content space specification files that includes the plurality of permissions from an access control list processing the plurality of content space specification files to generate a plurality of access control list roles and outputting the plurality of access control list roles.

Further exemplary embodiments include a computer implemented method for generating role based authorizations the method including collecting a plurality of permissions from an access control list defining a content space including a plurality of cells each cell defining an ACL role each cell having a plurality of dimensions creating a plurality of content space specification files that includes the plurality of permissions from an access control list traversing at least one dimension of each of the plurality of cells to generate an access control list role mapping the plurality of access control list roles to the content space and generating reports defining each of the access control list roles.

Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features refer to the description and to the drawings.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein implement a content space to manage software products that require users to log on via a security policy for role based authorization. Within the content space various roles are defined by the product to which individual users are assigned. For each role there is some set of associated functions permissions that the users in that role are allowed to perform. Customers can define and configure new roles. For a given product the default roles tend to be fairly stable but the permissions change every release. These changes are needed to do changing product functionality feedback from customers defects and product re factoring. Currently the costs of maintaining the definition and implementation integrity of the default role based authorizations and the results are high and error prone due to modern product sizes 5 10 million lines of code MLOC not unusual . By changing to content space based definitions for permissions maintenance costs are reduced defects are reduced testing costs are reduced. The systems and methods described here also map permissions to the content space as part of the content space implementation solution. By shipping the content space with the permission definitions the product and run time authorization checking based on content space look up is faster more localized more reliable and easier to change in future releases.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein base default ACL policies on the related product s content space. The default ACL policies are used during development of the related product and can be used at run time in the related product. Subsequent updates to ACL by authorized and authenticated users are also done in terms of and via the content space. In exemplary embodiments the content space model is mapped to the ACL model as described further herein. ACL permissions are mapped to content space noun verb combinations ACL resources are mapped to nouns or platforms of the content space or both the aforementioned are mapped. Instances of the content space model and the ACL model are available at run time depending on the user story in this case a particular permission. In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein can implement interfaces on the related product to facilitate mapping. If used they are mapped to permissions. ACL Roles are unchanged and they are mapped to content space nouns verb and hence to user stories. As such the systems and methods described herein control the resolution of the content space including varying the content space. The content space can also be defined around security policy Role concepts which can be performed in each content space dimension independently. Each user story in the content space includes one or more roles associated with it based on mapping of the ACL defined during development of the related product.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein associate each content space based user story with a default role and subsequently generate default policies and tests. The systems and methods described herein further to build the content space based ACL into the shipped product run time artifacts i.e. binaries to support authorization checking at run time. The systems and methods described herein further execute content space based ACL checking at run time. In addition the systems and methods described herein enable customers to edit and audit the content space based ACL.

As described herein a content space model is implemented for ACL authorization. A content space is a way of representing software content from an outside in perspective via a set of dimensions. Each of the content space dimensions has values defined in terms of the software itself that concern a particular aspect such as information abstraction function external interface and run time environment. The dimension values can represent existing content and also new content for the software based on requirements via content space analysis for a new release. The content space can be programmatically traversed and as this traversal occurs end to end testable units termed user stories are output each corresponding to a particular region of the content space and having content space coordinates. The set of all output user stories partitions the software content and the set of all new and changed user stories partitions the release requirements. The set of all user stories and various subsets e.g. all Power user stories are used to compute the content coverage metric of various scopes.

An example of how a content space can be set up and implemented is now discussed. It will be appreciated that the following example is illustrative of a content space and not limiting.

In exemplary embodiments the content space can be a five dimensional space termed either as a software product content space or a content space such that each cell within the content space is an end to end use case i.e. agile user story . In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein can be implemented at various levels of scale from individual software components to very large products comprising hundreds of components to define the ACL. The five dimensions structure the work as needed by software development i.e. design test project management and the requirements serve to define the values used on the dimensions. As such the exemplary content space servers to bridge the requirements domain and implementation domain.

In exemplary embodiments content space specification files are generated from the various sources in the requirements domain as described herein. As described further herein the content space specification files are generated from various requirements . A content space tool receives the content specification files to automatically generate the agile user stories that can be stored in a user story storage medium . An additional storage medium can be implemented to store changes to the specification files or any other suitable output during the content space generation. Once generated the agile user stories can be output to any suitable project management or test management tool implemented by the users in the development domain.

The system includes several functions including but not limited to 1 articulating the content space 2 classifying regions of the content space 3 grouping the regions of the content space 4 assigning priorities to use cases and 5 loading the project management tool .

In articulating the content space requirements are analyzed in terms of the five content space dimensions. This analysis results in with iteration and consensus building a definition of values for each of the five dimensions which is represented in a form that can be programmatically processed. In articulating the content space the systems and methods described herein address whether all the requirements are represented in the content space whether each content space dimension value is properly defined and agreed upon and whether all the dimension values are related to explicit implicit or future requirements.

In classifying the regions of the content space once the team is satisfied that the content space is defined i.e. all dimension values known understood and reasonably well defined and that it does encompass all the requirements for a selected time frame the team next decides on how to classify regions of the content space. Through automated systems with team decisions every cell in the content space is categorized in a variety of types including but not limited to 1 does not apply to the product 2 does apply to the product but for some future release 3 is part of the product today or from some prior release and has no enhancements or changes 4 is part of the product today and is enhanced or changed in some way and 5 is a new or an enhanced function. The systems and methods described herein determine whether each content space dimension value is classified and reviews of the results determine correctness.

Following agreement on the content space and categorization of regions the content space regions are then grouped. Subsets of the content space are grouped together into a size which is desirable for project management and the scale of the product and teams. This step applies particularly to the content space regions classified as unchanged and new or enhanced changed . The two extremes are an entire content space can be grouped into a single output project management work item or at the other extreme every single content space cell can be output as a single project management line item. Essentially every possible grouping in between these extremes is also supported. Typically used are grouping all new changed user stories for a particular platform or grouping specific sub variations of a verb.

In exemplary embodiments there is flexibility in how these regions are selected and how they related to the content space cell classifications. The systems and methods described herein determine whether the grouping is correct and do the groupings properly reflect the tradeoff between project management needs and technical visibility based on classifications and complexity.

The grouping of content space cells into right sized project management work items mostly focused on a new function and an existing and unchanged function. The user team can programmatically select the grouping of content space cells based on many considerations such overall content space size product size degree of technical difficulty of new function team size number of team and the like. In exemplary embodiments individual content cells are use cases with adjustable granularity and the groupings are user functions or user stories.

Based on the relative priorities of requirements regions of the content space subsets of use cases are assigned priority values. These can be used to help focus review sessions to ensure the right higher priority content is defined. When loaded into a project management application the priorities can be used directly by development in Agile sprint iteration planning. The output project management work items are input e.g. import for example from the user story storage medium into an appropriate project management tool .

As described herein a content space can be defined by five dimensions. In exemplary embodiments the five dimensions of the content space are in order release time noun verb interface and platform. The three dimensions verb interface and platform are orthogonal and noun specific. That is an instance of these e.g. a verb set an interface set and a platform set is defined for each noun of interest. Nouns are the fourth dimension. The combination of a noun and its associated 3D space is termed a noun space . A set of noun spaces at a given point in time usually associated with product release constitute the definition of the content space for a particular release of a product when the point in time is chosen on a release calendar boundary . Instances a product content space for multiple releases represent the fifth dimension of content space time.

For illustrative purposes an example of a software product a hypothetical browser based email client is discussed for ease of discussion. It will be appreciated that other products are contemplated for which ACL authorizations can be defined.

The platform dimension is interpreted broadly to include the hardware operating system middle ware hypervisor and language runtime in which the product executes. Generally meaningful platform elements are determined by each product. As such the entire prerequisite software stack and hardware is considered. Values of the platform dimension can include specific releases of each of these platform components as needed or can be more generally specified. For example a platform might be AIX 5.2 or just AIX. Alternatively the platform might be Firefox 3.6 or better or just Firefox. Values can include as needed ancillary hardware for storage networking hardware management controllers firmware etc. for the full functional system configuration.

The interface dimension has values chosen to identify and separate the kinds of interfaces that the subject software presents to external entities people other software or hardware. The values can be specified by type such as Graphical User Interface GUI command line interface CLI and so on. The values can include programmable interfaces such as web services e.g. REST and APIs. Protocols can also be specified as values e.g. IPv6 or MPI Message Processing Interface used in super computing environments .

The verb dimension includes values such as functions or operations that are supported by the subject software for a particular noun. The operations may be specified at varying levels of granularity depending upon the needs of a given set of requirements. For example copy or create might be sufficient. More fine grained values such copy to like repository and copy to new folder can also be used. The decision depends on considerations like how new the function is or how critical the different forms of copy are to the product stake holders those that define requirements or how technically difficult to implement.

The noun dimension is an abstract entity presented to externals via the interface s . Most software for direct use by people has a number of such abstractions that people manipulate via the functions verbs presented by the software. Example nouns for an email client can include but are not limited to inbox inbox email folder and draft email. As with values on the above dimensions there is flexibility in how coarse grained or fine grained the nouns are defined. The right level of noun dimension granularity for a given product and given release depends on the requirements.

The time dimension values include natural values i.e. discrete units which are the releases planned for the product. The content space for release n 1 can be various additions and changes relative to the release n content space. These additions enhancements and other changes affect the release n content space by changing the values defined on the various dimensions. New nouns new verbs new platforms can all be added. Enhancements to exiting nouns and verbs are common and defined explicitly in the n 1 content space.

Because of the way the dimensions are defined each generated user story is an end to end testable unit of function sometimes termed FVT able where FVT Function Verification Test . For example for an email client each user story is a cell in the five dimensional space with coordinates of release noun verb interface and platform. For example send an email on Firefox via GUI release n is represented by a 5 tuple release n email send GUI Firefox as shown in .

In grouping user stories a set of user stories is represented in output as a single user story. For example all the user stories for platform ABC or for function XYZ might be represented by a single output user story. Grouping does not change the size of a content space. Grouping allows the number of output user stories to be directly managed without eliminating any details from the CS specification. There is no limit on the size of a user story group. In exemplary embodiments grouping is controlled by the user by filters in the content space specification file .

As filtering occurs when a filter matches a user story and the filter has any kind of grouping requested save the user story is saved in a buffer associated with the filter. After all filtering and all non grouped user stories are output. The content space tool loops through all the filters that have any kind of grouping. For each filter the content space tool performs several steps. First if a simple group is requested in the filter the content space tool generates the single grouping user story summary field description field and the like and writes to output. The content space tool then continues to the next filter. If a type of group by is requested then for each group by element e.g. noun verb ifc platform the content space tool builds subsets of the respective values on the dimension from among the buffered user stories. The content space tool then generates a single user story group for each cross dimension subset generates the description field that itemizes the subset of user stories for the group and writes the user story group.

Folding also reduces the number of output user stories like grouping. But in contrast to grouping folding reduces the size of the content space. Folding reduces the size of the content space by collecting some number of dimension element values into a single value folding operates on the content space itself while grouping operates on user stories . The resulting single value is then used as a dimension element value in place of the multiple collected values thereby reducing the size of the content space. The single resulting value is termed a folding symbol fold sym .

As described herein folding does not eliminate the details from the content space specification file. The values collected into a fold sym remain in the content space specification file and the folding done by the fold sym can be toggled on or off. The value folding can be switched on and off for each of the noun verb interface and platform dimensions independently or all four dimensions together. Hence not only are the values still in the spec file but the content space can also be processed again and user stories generated without folding or different folding to see the detail. Folding can include both dimension folding and value folding.

In exemplary embodiments the content space tool processes command line parameters to determine what kinds of folding are requested. If no fold parameter the content space tool implements the default setting for folding. As the content space specification files are read the content space tool collects a list of all fold syms and values for each. After all the noun spaces are read from input files the content space tool invokes a fold function. The content space tool implements dimension folding first if requested. For each dimension for which folding is requested the dimension is folded to in each noun space. If value folding is requested for any dimensions that have not been folded the following steps are implemented. If noun value folding the content space tool folds the noun values by removing nouns in value list of a fold sym and replace with single instance of the fold sym. For each remaining noun space for each relevant dimension the content space tool check each dimension value to see if it is in the value list of a fold sym. If the noun is in the value list of the fold sym then the content space tool removes the value and adds the fold sym once only to the dimension list. If folding has been set off the content space tool takes no action. The content space by default is loaded in this mode. If fold request for the all or similar the interface and platform dimensions are folded as above and the verb dimension is value folded for all noun spaces are folded and the noun dimension is value folded.

Referring still to at block each user story is enumerated in the content space and run through filters to classify and possibly add data. At block the user story groups are generated and at block show requests and a summary are generated. At block the ACL roles are mapped to associated permissions as further described herein. At block the ACL roles and associated content space defining the roles are embedded in the associated software product.

In exemplary embodiments a content space is specified in a form that is processed read by the content space tool e.g. an Agile user story generation program . The specification can be split among multiple files e.g. the content space specification files which can be processed individually or together. As such an overall product content space can be split among some number of individual architects for parallel concurrent activity and then processed as a whole.

In exemplary embodiments each content space specification file includes some number of noun spaces defined symbols and filters. A content space specification file is used to define a content space in a form that can be processed programmatically. In exemplary embodiments the specification file is implemented to generate user stories and provide various kinds of statistics about the content space enables content coverage metric automated comparisons of multiple content spaces e.g. cross release and the like. In exemplary embodiments the content space specification file includes several statements which define among other things a noun space that can include noun verb interface ifc and platform. A content space is a set of noun spaces. As such a basic content space specification file defines one or more noun spaces. Descriptive names are used for the values on all these dimensions. In exemplary embodiments additional statements can be added to the content space specification file . On statement is symbol SYM to simplify maintenance of the content space specification file by reducing redundancy across noun space definitions. Another statement is a filter statement that is used to classify user stories and to add information to output user stories. In exemplary embodiments each instance of statements as a group defines a single noun space. For example the noun statement gives the noun space a name and the other verb interface and platform statements provide the values for which each dimension is named.

As further described herein a sym statement is a simple mechanism to create a short hand for a list of values. The short hand can then be used in defining noun spaces e.g. in noun verb ifc platform statements in other sym statements and in filter statements. This implementation of sym statements therefore simplifies use and later changes to the content specification file since the list of related values can reliably changed throughout a set of specification files by changing it in only a single place. For example assume a content space has 15 noun spaces and 12 of those all use the same platform list. Then that list can defined once as a sym and that sym name used in the 12 noun spaces. The example illustrates a group of related syms that aggregates various example platforms. The sym all email env is then used to in the definition of various noun spaces for example in the draft email noun space.

The symbols that end in a trailing   underbar are fold syms as is the send  . The   indicates a symbol that can be folded. If the relevant type of value folding is requested e.g. verb value to fold verb dimension or platform value to fold platform dimension then the symbols marked with a trailing   are folded. That is the symbol itself is used in the content space when folded. If not folded the symbol s value list is used in the content space. When folded a symbol is shown in generated user stories with the trailing   so that everyone seeing the user story will know it is folded is an abstraction .

As further described herein filter statements are used to classify user stories into one of five categories n a future nochange changed or new. They also can add to a story a variety of information. A filter statement has the general structure filter . The filter expression is a logical expression i.e. evaluates to True or False based on the language of the content the content space tool . For example logical operators are supported i.e. 

In exemplary embodiments the content space specification files can implement additional statements including but not limited to 1 comment off used to end commented out block of lines 2 comment on used to start a block of comment lines. Starts skipping 3 createdby used to set the field Created By 4 csvfile sets the name of the output .csv file 5 eof logically ends file early rest of file skipped 6 include name a file to be included 7 plannedfor used to set the RTC field Planned For 8 scope used to set filter scope to file default or global 9 set filterid in summaryfield true or false default 10 set implicit folding true or false default 11 set summary prefix Default is User Story 12 set summary suffix Default is category of the user story 13 tag exclusion set Define a mutually exclusive set of tags and 14 title title label of content space.

As described herein the specification files support the definition of symbols used in the defining the values and in the filters that is used within the content space specification file itself. This format helps maintain a content space specification by lessening duplication of constants i.e. dimension values . This format also serves to help the specification file be self documenting when description names are used for the symbols. For example a list of platforms used in a prior release might be assigned to a symbol named prior platforms . This symbol is then used in the noun spaces as a short hand for the full list. This symbol can also be used in the filters.

Each use case in a content space is classified using filters into basic categories including but not limited to not applicable future regression and development. Not applicable are use cases judged to likely never be relevant for the product and future are use cases not in the n 1 release but inherent in the content space. In exemplary embodiments the content space is identified to clearly encompass the requirements to help ensure nothing is missed. In doing so some use cases are likely to be generated that are not planned for the current release.

In exemplary embodiments filters are also implemented to add information to the generated use cases. Examples of information that can be added are priority tags references to requirements document and the like.

In exemplary embodiments filters are also implemented to cause sets of use cases to be grouped into a single broader output use case. Implementing filters in this manner can be helpful in the case regression use cases where fine grained management and tracking of the individual use cases is not necessary e.g. due to the existence of automated testing built during previous releases .

In generating the agile use cases one or more content space specification files are read by the content space tool . As described herein a primary output is the user story storage medium . In exemplary embodiments the user story storage medium can have a comma separated value .csv file format which is a quasi standard widely used by many software applications. A second type of output is the additional storage medium for various summary and report like information or in progress changes.

As described herein ACL roles are mapped to permissions at block . illustrates a flow diagram illustrating the mapping of permissions. As illustrated a user can implement the content space tool to map a content space to ACL roles . From the ACL roles several functions are possible including but not limited to deploying out of box policies for a software product release automating test processes of the software product and analyzing the software product for completeness. In exemplary embodiments in mapping the ACL roles to permissions each content space noun verb is mapped to a permission. A content space noun in represented as a resource and a user is a subject assigned to a role in the content space. A user in a role can then execute a verb noun via an interface on a range of platforms. Permission model mapping options can include but are not limited to 1 noun verb 2 noun verb interface and 3 noun verb interface platform.

In exemplary embodiments the content space tool that process the definition of the content space supports the addition of attributes to be associated with the generated user stories. Within the content space specification file for example filter statements may be written which map the ACL roles to content space elements such as specific nouns nouns and verbs or even sets of nouns and the like. As such for each of the default security policy Roles to be shipped and installed with a software product a few filter statements would be written. The labels used in these filter statement are exactly the content space element names as determined by typically product architects lead business people and technical leaders. Some examples include the following 

In exemplary embodiments a given user story can be authorized for multiple roles. There is no limit on number of roles or number of filter statements. In addition the completeness of the role mapping is done by inspection possibly automated of one of the various forms of output. For example a user can examine an output spreadsheet of user stories for any that have the default value of unassigned and if found the role mapping is incomplete. Review of role mapping for correctness is also facilitated by the spreadsheet selecting all the user stories for a given role. For example the review can be achieved via a rational team concert RTC query of the user stories.

As further described herein the ACL roles and the content space are embedded within a software product see block in . In exemplary embodiments the content space with role mapping is generated as a file which can be for example in a JavaScript Object Notation JSON format. In this example a small set of interfaces and a class are defined to access and update the embedded content space. A new jar file for example assuming a Java product is then shipped with the product. It will be appreciated that other file formats are contemplated in other exemplary embodiments.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein implement run time authorization checking based on the embedded content space. As described herein the embedded content space that is shipped with the software product is internally implemented at run time. The embedded content space has interfaces which support coordinate determination at run time. As a user interacts with the product through any interface e.g. a graphical user interface GUI command line interface CLI representational state transfer REST application programming interface API and the like content space coordinates are determined. The content space coordinates can include but are not limited to resource classes platforms endpoints and instances as needed. At run time when a particular action is to be taken by a user the current set of content space coordinates plus instance information plus role information associated with this user is passed to the authorization checking code. The content space coordinates have values for noun verb interface and platform target of function as described herein. When the particular action is about to be taken the content space and ACL roles are looked up to see if the user has the permission to take the action. Logically a table look up is done based on coordinates and the user s role is matched against the list associated with the user story.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein also support security policy changes by the user. The user is provided with an interface to see and edit the roles for their security policy that are associated with user stories. The roles and user stories can be viewed as sets or individually which supports the addition of new roles and the deletion of existing roles. The interface a GUI for example enables the user to see the existing roles and mappings of each to content space elements. During editing of a new role or changing an existing the user would be shown for example pull down lists of possible values to select or check mark for function interface and the like. For example the interface enables a kind of GUI navigation of the content space.

In exemplary embodiments a list of selectable content space elements in various categories i.e. content space dimensions is obtained by the GUI implementation via calls to an interface provided for this purpose by the embedded content space. It can be appreciated that the GUI may or may not make the notion of the content space explicit to the user. In one example the user may be aware that a content space is being used. In another example the content space may be concealed from the user but nonetheless implemented to manage the roles. The functions relating to the ACL changed in the embedded content space are represented in the content space as well. As such those nouns and verb and optionally interfaces and platforms have associated roles and the execution of these user stories by a given user is checked like any other user story authorization. Product fix packs can change the embedded content space and policy updates ACL edits by the user are also responsive to these changes.

The role based authorizations and other content space implementations described herein can be performed in any suitable computing system as now described. illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a system in which role based authorization based on a content space can be implemented. The methods described herein can be implemented in software e.g. firmware hardware or a combination thereof. In exemplary embodiments the methods described herein are implemented in software as an executable program and is executed by a special or general purpose digital computer such as a personal computer workstation minicomputer or mainframe computer. The system therefore includes general purpose computer .

In exemplary embodiments in terms of hardware architecture as shown in the computer includes a processor memory coupled to a memory controller and one or more input and or output I O devices or peripherals that are communicatively coupled via a local input output controller . The input output controller can be but is not limited to one or more buses or other wired or wireless connections as is known in the art. The input output controller may have additional elements which are omitted for simplicity such as controllers buffers caches drivers repeaters and receivers to enable communications. Further the local interface may include address control and or data connections to enable appropriate communications among the aforementioned components.

The processor is a hardware device for executing software particularly that stored in memory . The processor can be any custom made or commercially available processor a central processing unit CPU an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the computer a semiconductor based microprocessor in the form of a microchip or chip set a macroprocessor or generally any device for executing software instructions.

The memory can include any one or combination of volatile memory elements e.g. random access memory RAM such as DRAM SRAM SDRAM etc. and nonvolatile memory elements e.g. ROM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM electronically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM programmable read only memory PROM tape compact disc read only memory CD ROM disk diskette cartridge cassette or the like etc. . Moreover the memory may incorporate electronic magnetic optical and or other types of storage media. Note that the memory can have a distributed architecture where various components are situated remote from one another but can be accessed by the processor .

The software in memory may include one or more separate programs each of which comprises an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. In the example of the software in the memory includes the role based authorization methods described herein in accordance with exemplary embodiments and a suitable operating system OS . The OS essentially controls the execution of other computer programs such the role based authorization systems and methods as described herein and provides scheduling input output control file and data management memory management and communication control and related services.
