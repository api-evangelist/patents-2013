In an embodiment a system organizes information associated with media content from multiple media sources into a single unified library file. The information may be organized as indexed information. Managing media content is not limited to a single library file. In various embodiments more than one library file may be utilized. Access to a library file can be provided to a number of mobile devices. The access may be provided as full access or limited access. For example access to a library file by a mobile device may be limited to a mobile device based on whether the mobile device has one or more media players to operate on the media content. Other criteria may be used to limit access to a mobile device. In various embodiments the library file is maintained on the system and is accessed from the mobile device remotely. In various embodiments a library file or a modified version of a library file can be transferred to the mobile device and the mobile device can access the library file locally. The library file can be used by the mobile device to transfer media content from one or more media sources to the mobile device. The mobile device may have wireless capabilities. The mobile device may be a mobile wireless communication device.

Media sources may include media libraries for media players such as but not limited to libraries for iTunes audio players Windows Media Player WMP RealPlayer and other players. Each library may include collections of various media content. A collection is a subset of the files in a library. The collections may include references to the files. Each collection may refer to anywhere from zero files to all of the files in the library. An example of a collection of a music library is a playlist. In various embodiments sources of media content may be files within one or more folders on a single computer system or on multiple computer systems.

Processing modules include software and or hardware to transfer media content from media sources to devices that use the associated media. Processing modules include instrumentality to operate as a connector which means that the processing modules interface with media sources to collect information associated with a media file configured to operate with a specific media player. Processing modules may be arranged with a set of connectors one for each type of media player incorporated in system or used by mobile devices whose media content is managed by system . Processing modules may include connectors to interact with mobile wireless communication devices where the mobile wireless communication devices are a source of media content. Processing modules may use but are not limited to a Windows COM interface or a XML file when connecting to various media sources. In addition processing modules may create a representation for example a library or libraries of information regarding the media content of the media content available from multiple media sources. In various embodiments media content may include information with respect to another media file that is played by a media player. For instance a jpeg Joint Photographic Experts Group file may be a file of album art for songs on an album where the media files of the songs are played on a media player.

In various embodiments output from processing modules is a representation created by processing modules . The representation may also be maintained by processing modules . Output may include device specific data for a mobile wireless communication device or a media player. Output may comprise metadata such as metadata based on user preferences or device settings. Generally metadata is information about data. Various media content may be metadata with respect to other media content. For example a file having a jpg file format may provide information regarding an audio file having a mp3 file format such that the jpg file is metadata for the mp3 file.

In an example embodiment the representation may be any means for identifying the content of the media source files. In some embodiments a library file created by processing modules contains metadata for the media content available in the one or more media sources . . . N but omits the actual media content. Library file may be organized using a standard format that represents the information contained in the media sources. In various embodiments the standard format is a compressed format and or a format that is substantially smaller than the media library itself. For example a media library with 30 GB of audio files may be presented by processing modules in a file that may be 200 KB.

In operation system for managing media content shown in creates a representation of the media content available in one or more media sources . . . N and provides a means for accessing the media content by any device with a media player including a mobile wireless communications device. The device may browse the representation and may select individual media content items to copy or transfer from the media source to the device. After selection all or a portion of the media content item maybe transferred to the device and may be played on a media player on the device. In various embodiments system brings content from multiple media sources into a single unified library and pushes out device specific metadata from the single library to the specific device.

Media sync engines . . . M can create representations such as a library file or files identifying media content available from multiple media sources and provide data from the library to mobile wireless communications devices . . . N. In an embodiment a media sync engine is an example of the processing modules shown in . In various embodiments a media sync engine provides a method to synchronize a media library such as an iTunes digital music library with a smartphone such as a BlackBerry brand smart phone. The files may be transferred using a wireless connection or a wired connection such as a high speed USB 2.0 connection.

Mobile wireless communications devices may include but are not limited to mobile telephones portable computers personal digital assistants PDAs media players and other devices that may be conveniently carried by a user and provide wireless communication. Mobile telephones include wireless communication devices that have generally been referred to as cell phones. Mobile telephones may include a wide range of communication devices from portable phones with limited functionality beyond voice communication to portable phones capable of providing the functionality of a personal computer. Multiple devices of different types capabilities may transfer media content using one or more media sync engines.

Connectors identify specific instances of a particular type of library on the PC or mobile device. In other words connectors perform a discovery function that finds individual libraries. A connector for a particular library is capable of communicating with a particular library or file using a corresponding application programming interface API protocols file formats etc. When an individual library is discovered the connector can retrieve media collections from that instance of the individual library. Connectors may include an iTunes connector a WMP connector a RealPlayer connector and various other connectors correlated to instrumentality for operating on the respective media files to provide a presentation to the PC user. An individual connector may be configured as a combination of a read only connector and a writeable connector. A writeable connector may perform such activities as adding a user assigned rating for a song creating a playlist editing a playlist deleting a song etc.

Finder provides a discovery mechanism for connectors. Finder may identify what connectors are available for processing. The available connectors may register with finder . If a separate connector is used for each type of library the particular connectors that are discovered by finder can determine what type of libraries are in the system in which processing modules operate.

Cache manager may also determine which of the available connector s to use. For example if a collection of media content may be accessed either by using iTunes software or through an iTunes xml file cache manager can determine whether to use the iTunes application connector or the iTunes xml file connector in order to access the iTunes collection. Cache manager may provide a unified interface to multiple sources libraries. Cache manager may maintain a buffer that unifies files from different libraries. For example if the same music track is present in multiple libraries e.g. in a user s iTunes library and in the user s Windows Media Player library the cache manager may maintain a single buffer that is an aggregation of the tracks from the different libraries. Alternatively cache manager may maintain a separate buffer for each of the different libraries. Cache manager may implement the buffer using any form of data storage. In various embodiments the data storage may either be persistent or non persistent.

In various embodiments cache manager may implement connector watchers. A connector watcher monitors one or more collections and determines when a collection has changed. For example if an iTunes xml file changes or if the iTunes library has been updated cache manager which monitors that particular collection detects the update and reads the changes into an appropriate buffer. Cache manager may also determine when to update the device library.

Embodiments as illustrated in and similar embodiments may be implemented as a desktop application to transfer media content from multiple sources to a mobile wireless device. The desktop application for managing media content may be launched on a PC. The desktop application may be automatically launched on startup of the PC. The desktop application may be launched on detection of a device connection to the PC. In various embodiments a user may launch the desktop application. Alternatively embodiments as illustrated in and similar embodiments may be implemented to allow a mobile wireless device to update content already present on the mobile wireless device with media content from multiple sources.

In various embodiments a system managing media content can be structured to provide a number of different features. Content from multiple media sources may be entered into a single unified library and device specific metadata pushed out from the single library. A library file in a format to provide a compact representation of media metadata may be generated as output of processing modules similar to processing modules discussed with respect to . Varying schema can be used for choices to select group and rearrange data in the representation in the file format. Various features of a managing system may include maintaining representations of original source identifications so that an identifier such as an ID a path etc. may be used to track manage information regarding different multiple sources of substantially the same media content Various features of a managing system may include injecting or modifying metadata for a media file during transfer to a device Examples of injected metadata may include album art volume settings and other device settings user preferences and other parameters.

Management of media content on a mobile device may be realized through interaction with a media sync engine of one or more apparatus such as multiple PCs. The mobile device such as a mobile wireless communication device through such interaction acquires information regarding the availability of media files on each PC and an identity of the PC that was the source of media content existing on the mobile device.

Various features of the managing system may include a simplified user interface UI on the PC for transferring information to the mobile device and representing information that is present on the mobile device. The UI may generate representations to provide criteria for handling user selection of media content that exceeds device capacity. In various embodiments applications in the PC may use the information in the library of the PC to autonomously handle user selection of media content that exceeds device capacity. The UI can provide an automatic fill function for a user to select such that the PC automatically handles selection of media content to transfer to the mobile device. In the various embodiments a mobile device may be a mobile wireless communication device. A mobile wireless communication device may include instrumentality to manage media content in substantially the same manner as a PC.

For example a mobile wireless communication device that plays music may have a metadata file associated with all the music files stored on the device. The mobile wireless communication device that plays music may have a metadata file associated with a playlist of music files stored on the device. The mobile wireless communication device may have a metadata file associated with all the music files stored on a PC that the mobile wireless communication device may access to download music files to the mobile wireless communication device. In addition the mobile wireless communication device may include multiple media players. The multiple media players may include multiple players for a single type of media such as multiple players that provide music.

At metadata in the metadata file is modified during transfer of the metadata file to the destination such that the file on the destination is different from the source by having different or additional metadata without any intermediary or temporary file having been created. In various embodiments a media metadata file is modified during transfer of the media metadata file to the device. The media metadata file may be a media metadata library file. For all types of media files metadata may be modified according to injection policy parameters and or user settings associated with one or more music media files the device to which files are to be transferred and or the user of the device. In various embodiments a music media file metadata may be modified by injecting album art associated with the music file. In various embodiments volume settings for a music file may be injected into the metadata library file whereby the volume settings may be different for different music files. In various embodiments metadata in the metadata library file may be modified by injecting playing limitations or selection likelihoods associated with the music media files such as but not limited to content based limitations relative to age. In various embodiments video media files metadata may be modified by injecting viewing limitations associated with the video media files such as but not limited to content based limitations relative to age. In various embodiments the metadata of the media files may be modified by injecting artifacts indicative of the source of the transfer.

In various embodiments injection of metadata into a media metadata file may occur during a transfer of media files from a PC to a wireless communication device during a media synchronization process. The injection of the metadata may include adding new metadata to a metadata file or replacing metadata in a file with other metadata. When replacing the metadata in a file with other metadata an application running on the PC can make a determination that there is a segment of stored metadata accessible by the PC that is more relevant to the media file being transferred than a corresponding segment currently in the metadata file to be transferred to the wireless communication device. The metadata determined to be more relevant can be placed into the media metadata file with the corresponding segment being removed from the metadata file. In addition additional metadata can be inserted into the metadata file indicating the source from which the replacing metadata is derived.

In an embodiment a PC may contain a unified media library. The unified media library includes metadata for many or all media files accessible from one or many sources. The metadata is collected and stored by one or more applications of the PC that monitor and collect metadata as artifacts of activities by media applications that manage the media files. The acquisition and storage of metadata can include activities of the users of the PC where the activities are related to characteristics of the media files. For example when a site on the Internet is accessed and music is played in a streaming mode on the PC the identity of the music the name of the artist the length of the music track the identity of the website may be collected and stored in a storage medium accessible by the PC. If the same music is accessed from the same website this information can be captured and the two occurrences can be related as being the same music with a high level of confidence. If the same music is accessed from another website the collected data will be different but using information that is common to both the two instances of the music can be identified as being the same with a different level of confidence. In addition the total information regarding a media file stored by the PC can include different metadata from different sources. For example with a music file of a song stored in a iTunes library on the PC and album art for the song provided from a source other than the iTunes library the unified media library can include the album art as associated with the song along with the identification of the sources of this metadata. The acquisition storage and analysis of metadata is not limited to metadata for music files but may include video files multimedia files pictures files document files and other media related files.

In various embodiments one or more media files managed by a PC are to be transferred to a mobile device such as but not limited to a mobile wireless communication device. The initiation of the transfer may be generated using various mechanisms. A user at a user interface of the PC may select transfer of the files. The transfer can begin directly from the user selecting a download activity of the media file or a sync activity to synchronize a set of media files on the PC as media files on the wireless communication device. The transfer can begin sometime after the user selection based on such factors as a determination by an application of the PC that the wireless communication device has capacity to receive the media files determination by an application of the PC has there is a communication path to the wireless communication device that has capacity to transfer the media files and or a determination by an application of the PC has there is no other restriction on transferring the media files from the PC to the wireless communication device. Other criteria may be used to transfer the files.

In addition a user of the mobile device may desire to browse through a list of media files to play on the user s mobile device With the mobile device having a screen display information about the media files on the mobile device can be presented to the user on the screen display in various formats. The displayed information regarding media files on the mobile device or accessible to the mobile device may include for each media file the name of the media art the artist a time length associated with the media art artwork work associated with the media art. For a selection of music media the displayed information can include without limitation the name of a song the person or group performing the song the track length for playing the song album art of an album in which the song is a part of the album. For a selection of video media the displayed information can include without limitation the name of a movie primary individuals performing in the movie the track length for playing the movie marquee art associated with advertising the movie. Other media which can be played on the mobile device with characteristic information regarding a selected media or selection of media presented on the screen display include but are not limited to music videos television shows user interactive applications audio books podcasts games and other media presentations. The information can include data for applications on the mobile device to manage media files on the mobile device to manage media sync with a PC and or to manage acquisition of media files from other sources external to the mobile device. The information can be stored in the mobile device as metadata associated with the media files in a variety of formats for management by applications on the mobile device.

An extractor which reads the information in buffer in equivalently the same manner as an application on the specified mobile device that reads the metadata writes the desired metadata in output buffer to be transferred to the specified mobile device. During writing to output buffer metadata can be injected into the metadata file to be transferred to the specified mobile device. Various mechanisms may be used to inject metadata to alter the data in buffer to realize the data in output buffer . For example extractor may perform the data injection as data flows from buffer to output buffer . Data injection may include no modification by extractor . The definition of the stream builder can be done without loading the streams into a buffer and can combine source information from various buffers in memory files and network streams. In various embodiments the transfer of the streams is batched over several stream builders allowing use of shared buffer resources and scheduling of IO operations for efficient usage of computing resources such as transfer bandwidth CPU time threads and persistent disk space.

If selection of media art such as a song is from a media library that does not include all the information that is anticipated by the receiving mobile device extractor can inject information in accordance with the file transfer rules. If the missing information is in another media library or is associated with a source other than the source providing the media file extractor can inject the metadata. For example if a selected song is in an iTunes library on the PC without associated album artwork extractor can inject the album artwork such as a jpeg file that is stored in the PC associated with the song in a WMP library. Injection of the album artwork from a different source may be based on confidence levels that the selected song is substantially the same and that the selected album artwork corresponds to the selected song. Alternatively an application on the PC can use confidence levels regarding the relationship of the selected song and associated album from different sources and the quality of the album art from the different sources to substitute album artwork for the song from a source different than the source of the selected song.

With a file transferred to a mobile device according to the set of rules for transferal as a string of bytes to n the information whether the album artwork for the song or an indication of the absence of the album artwork can be located from bytes i to j. Extractor can remove the information and insert the album artwork in location i to j. If the insert album artwork requires a number of bytes that does not match the number of bytes from location i to j information regarding the change in byte size can be provided in header information of the file transfer to the mobile device. Rather than perform a remove operation extractor can write bytes to i 1 sent to buffer into output buffer write the bytes being injected into the file into output buffer starting at byte i following byte i 1 and write the bytes j 1 to n sent to buffer in the file in output buffer following the injected data. In addition to injecting the album artwork other metadata regarding the album artwork such as source or sources associated with the album artwork confidence levels regarding these sources and artifacts generated from the album artwork may be injected. The injection and composition of the output stream may be the result of any number of addition exclusion and replacement operations all defined in the stream builder.

Buffer and output buffer may be structured with sufficient size to accommodate the injection process. Buffer and output buffer may be arranged as variable size buffers to contain additional bytes of data generated in the metadata injection process. The additional information may include the start and end location in the file string of the injected information or the start location in the file string of the injected information and the length of the injected data and the size of the modified file. A fidelity level may be injected as metadata as the file is being transferred that provides information regarding the media file such as a song being transferred which may include but is not limited to whether the media file is a sample of the media art and not a complete copy of the media art and other information regarding the quality of the media art. The use of the sample may allow the user to decide whether or not the complete media art should be transferred. This sample process allows for evaluation without using large amounts of capacity on the communication medium for transferal that may provide for sampling of a number of media art such as a large number of songs. This sample process allows for evaluation to determine whether or not a greater set of media art such as a collection of songs or collection of movies should be acquired. Acquisition may be through purchase of the selected media art via an on line store or purchase of a machine readable medium such as a CD DVD or other such format for media art.

Transcoding is conversion of a media format to another media format such as a digital to digital conversion from one format to another format. It typically may include decoding decompressing original data to an intermediate format followed by re encoding the intermediate format into a target format. Transcoding may include a process to change assembled code to function on a different platform or operating system. Transcoding provides a process of converting a media file or object from one format to another. For example transcoding may be used to convert among video formats such as Beta VHS Video Home System QuickTime Video for Windows MPEG Moving Picture Experts Group and other video formats. Transcoding may be used to convert among audio formats such as way Waveform audio format au Audio file format mp3 MPEG 1 Audio Layer 3 wma Windows Media Audio aiff Audio Interchange File Format and other audio formats. Transcoding may be used to convert among multimedia container formats such as mp4 QuickTime or other similar format which are commonly used to store digital audio streams digital video streams and related data. Other media conversions may include text and graphic files for use in mobile devices that may have small screen sizes low memory and low bandwidth rates. Transcoding may provide the encoding of files to a lower bit rate without changing media formats a process that is also known as transrating. Transcoding provides a mechanism for the PC to provide a format to a specific mobile device according to the formats that the specific mobile device is configured to support. Transcoding may be an optional procedure since some media content may be provided without transcoding.

In various embodiments an application on an apparatus similar to the stream builder of can be realized to provide metadata injection as one or more media files are being transferred to a mobile device. The application may be arranged to acquire streams of information from multiple sources and generate a file including a composition of the streams that are placed in an order that can be read on another apparatus. The order of the composition of data streams may be defined under one or more rule sets stored or determinable by both apparatus.

The length and locations of the various streams of the composition may be provided to the receiving apparatus using various mechanisms. The length and location information may be provided in a header as part of the file containing the composition of streams where the rules regarding the header information may be stored in each apparatus. The length and location information may be provided in a separate file. The length and location information may be provided by the file format containing the composition of streams including a section of the file that includes a dictionary that defines the manner in which to read the file.

Metadata injection during transfer of foes may be used in various apparatus. A PC may provide metadata injection in the transferal of media files to mobile devices such as mobile wireless devices. The PC may include instrumentality to operate as a wireless server with a mobile wireless communication device. A mobile device may provide metadata injection in the transferal of media files or metadata files related to a given set of media files to a personal computer to mobile devices through the PC and or directly to the other mobile devices. Such a mobile device may be realized as a mobile wireless communication device. The various transferals may be conducted using a direct wired link such as provided by a USB connection or other such link a Wi Fi network or other such link a large area wireless network and other communication paths.

In various embodiments metadata injection may be used to map metadata associated with one of more media libraries on a PC to a mobile device. The mobile device may be mobile wireless communication device. The PC can be configured to include a wireless server. The PC may include a media sync engine and K media libraries where each of the media libraries have Ncollections of media files. The media sync engine may include M collections of data and artifacts related to the Ncollections of the K media libraries that media engine can sync to a mobile device. The media engine may be limited in the amount of data that can be synced to the mobile device based on various criteria that include the nature of the media files. Certain media files may be restricted from playing on devices other than the PC on which the media files were acquired. In addition based on various criteria P collections of media files are selected for download to the mobile device. The selection of the P collections may depend on media file size capacity of available transport settings of the mobile device user preferences and use restrictions on activities of the identified user registered to the mobile device. The identity of the registered user of the mobile device may be determined on the establishment of a communication link between the PC and the mobile device. Alternatively in various embodiments metadata injection may be used to map metadata associated with one of more media libraries on a PC directly from the media libraries to the mobile device. In various embodiments the media libraries may be external to the PC.

In various embodiments a media metadata file is transferred from a PC to a wireless communication device that is associated in some manner with the Pc. The media metadata file being transferred from the PC to the wireless communication device may be a media library file identifying media files on the Pc. In an embodiment once transferred the wireless communication device has the same media library file as the PC except that the media library file on the wireless communication device may include additional information in the form of metadata that is generated as an artifact of the transfer of the medial library file from the PC to the wireless communication device. The injection of the artifact may be viewed as stamp coding the metadata file to dynamically modify the metadata such that what is placed on the device is a different from what was on the PC. The stamp coding of metadata can include an identification of the PC as the source of the transferred media metadata file.

In various embodiments a VI for managing media foes on the device and pending transfers is provided. The VI may include graphical indicators for status e.g. on device on PC etc. and or actions e.g. download purchase preview email play remotely .
