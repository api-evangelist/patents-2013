Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station or a transceiver node and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicate with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission also known as a broadcast channel BC can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission also known as a multiple access channel MAC can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

Downlink and uplink channels or transmissions can use time division duplexing TDD or frequency division duplexing FDD . Time division duplexing TDD is an application of time division multiplexing TDM to separate downlink and uplink signals. In TDD downlink signals and uplink signals may be carried on a same carrier frequency i.e. shared carrier frequency where the downlink signals use a different time interval from the uplink signals so the downlink signals and the uplink signals do not generate interference for each other. TDM is a type of digital multiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals such as a downlink or uplink are transferred apparently simultaneously as sub channels in one communication channel but are physically transmitted on different resources. In frequency division duplexing FDD an uplink transmission and a downlink transmission can operate using different frequency carriers i.e. separate carrier frequency for each transmission direction . In FDD interference can be avoided because the downlink signals use a different frequency carrier from the uplink signals.

The eNB can have multiple antennas used for transmission to the UEs allowing the eNB to use multiple input and multiple output MIMO . MIMO is a smart antenna technology that refers to the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance where input and output refer to a radio channel carrying the signal not necessarily to the devices having antennas. In MIMO up to eight transmit or receive antennas can be used or up to eight channels can be used for transmission of a resource.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A wireless communication system can be subdivided into various sections referred to as layers. In the LTE system communication layers can include the physical PHY media access control MAC radio link control RLC packet data convergence protocol PDCP and radio resource control RRC layers. The physical layer can include the basic hardware transmission components of a wireless communication system as illustrated in . A basic multiple input multiple output MIMO system is used for simplicity in illustrating the basic hardware transmission components but the components can also be adapted for a complex MIMO system a single input and single output SISO system or similar system. For example in a MIMO system at the transmitter binary input data can be protected through encoding using a channel encoder interleaved against fading phenomenon using an interleaver and mapped to improve reliability using a mapper . The mapped data can be separated into layers for antenna ports by a transmitter TX beamformer and the layers can be OFDM modulated into OFDM symbols using modulators A B. The modulators can use an inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT algorithm to compute the inverse discrete Fourier transform IDFT to generate modulated signals vector x for each antenna port . The modulated signals can be converted to analog signals with digital to analog converters DACs A B. The analog signals can be transmitted via radio frequency RF transmitters Txs A B configured to send the signal to transmitter antennas A B operable to communicate the signal. The analog signals will follow a path referred to as a channel. The analog signals travelling through that path can be referred to as a channel signal . The physical layer can include other components not shown such as series to parallel S P converters parallel to serial P S converters cyclic prefix CP inserters and deleters guardband inserters and deleters and other desired components.

The transmitted channel signal can be subject to noise and interference . The interference can include intra cell interference and intercell interference. Intra cell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted within the cell of the transmitter . Intercell interference can refer to interference from other channel signals transmitted by neighboring cells. The noise and interference is represented as an addition to the channel signal which can be received by receiver antennas A B and one or more radio frequency RF receivers Rxs A B at the receiver . The channel signal combined with the noise and interference can be converted to a digital modulated signal with analog to digital converters ADCs A B. The digital signal can be OFDM demodulated using demodulators A B. The demodulators can use a fast Fourier transform FFT algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform DFT to generate demodulated signals vector y for each antenna port . A channel estimator can use the demodulated signal to estimate the channel and the noise and interference that occurs in the channel. The channel estimator can include a feedback generator or be in communication with the feedback generator which can generate a physical uplink shared channel PUSCH feedback report such as a channel quality indicator CQI report a precoding matrix indicator PMI report or a transmission rank indicator RI report. The CQI can be used to assist the MIMO transmissions modes. The demodulated signals can be combined using a MIMO decoder demapped using a demapper deinterleaved using a deinterleaver and decoded by a channel decoder to generate binary output data that can be used by other layers of the receiving station.

In one example the resource elements REs can represent elements of a radio frame structure transmitted on the physical PHY layer in a downlink transmission between a node e.g. eNodeB and the wireless device e.g. UE using a generic 3GPP long term evolution LTE frame structure as illustrated in .

Each slot for a component carrier CC used by the node and the wireless device can include multiple resource blocks RBs and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. The CC can have a carrier frequency having a bandwidth and center frequency. Each subframe of the CC can include downlink control information DCI found in the legacy PDCCH. The legacy PDCCH in the control region can include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or physical RB PRB when a legacy PDCCH is used. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols or 14 OFDM symbols when legacy PDCCH is not used in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data for short or normal cyclic prefix .

The control region can include physical control format indicator channel PCFICH physical hybrid automatic repeat request hybrid ARQ indicator channel PHICH and the PDCCH. The control region has a flexible control design to avoid unnecessary overhead. The number of OFDM symbols in the control region used for the PDCCH can be determined by the control channel format indicator CFI transmitted in the physical control format indicator channel PCFICH . The PCFICH can be located in the first OFDM symbol of each subframe. The PCFICH and PHICH can have priority over the PDCCH so the PCFICH and PHICH are scheduled prior to the PDCCH.

Each RB physical RB or PRB can include 12 15 kHz subcarriers on the frequency axis and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM symbols on the time axis per slot. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements REs using short or normal cyclic prefixing or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs not shown using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol by one subcarrier i.e. 15 kHz .

Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase shift keying QPSK modulation. Other types of modulation may be used such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation QAM or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE or bi phase shift keying BPSK modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits a single bit in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.

A MIMO wireless network can be used for beamforming. Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used in antenna arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. Beamforming can be achieved by combining elements in a phased array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. Beamforming can be used at both the transmitting and receiving ends in order to achieve spatial selectivity.

Cellular data demand continues to experience an increasing growth rate. Combined with the scarcity of available bandwidth wireless and cellular systems can use MIMO to deliver drastically increased spectral efficiencies to address the capacity demand. Single user SU and multi user MU MIMO systems are integral parts of 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE specifications with antenna dimensions of up to eight antennas in a base station e.g. eNodeB . However an order of magnitude increase in the number of transmit antennas known as massive MIMO or full dimension MIMO can result in significantly higher spectral efficiency.

In a multi user MIMO MU MIMO system the aggregate users rates e.g. sum rate capacity or the capacity rate of all the actives users can increase linearly with the number of transmit Tx antennas assuming channel state information CSI is available at the transmitter. The reliability and precision of the CSI can limit the achievable capacity gains. For example in the frequency division duplex FDD mode of an LTE system the user equipment UE can send CSI back to the eNodeB to inform the eNodeB of different measures of the channel quality. The UE can compute CSI from the reference signals RS embedded in the transmitted physical resource blocks PRB . Channel measurements and feedback can be provided over up to eight antenna ports for various standards such as LTE Advanced frequency division duplex FDD specifications. To realize large gains provided by massive MIMO systems the size of overhead and CSI signaling can be minimized as well as controlling precision requirements of the CSI feedback. Otherwise linear scaling of pilots e.g. RS and feedback with the number of antennas can become prohibitive which can limit the gains from massive MIMO systems.

Using typically MIMO approaches e.g. MIMO with transmit antennas up to eight antennas can generate massive pilots and massive CSI requirements. As disclosed herein a massive MIMO technology can resolve issues of massive pilots and massive CSI requirements. As a result a massive MIMO system with reduced pilots and reduced CSI requirements can preserve linear scaling of a sum rate with a large number of transmit antennas e.g. greater than 8 transmit antennas . Another challenge in MU MIMO is fairness in serving different users so none of the UEs wait indefinitely to receive service regardless of the UE s channel conditions e.g. UEs with poor SINRs may not be starved .

Massive MIMO can be applied to FDD or TDD. In time division duplex TDD massive MIMO CSI at the transmitter can be obtained from uplink channel measurements through channel reciprocity. Since the same channel is not used for uplink and downlink in FDD limited overhead signaling and CSI feedback can be used for increasing sum rate capacity for massive MU MIMO beamforming such as used in 3GPP LTE systems.

Principles of random beam forming RBF can be applied for a large antenna array MU MIMO system. RBF can provide linear scaling of MU MIMO sum rate capacity relative to a number of transmit antennas e.g. transmit antenna size without full channel knowledge at the transmitter. Limited and partial channel information can be used at the transmitter and still provide an increased sum rate capacity. Using features of RBF pilot overhead and feedback requirements of a massive MIMO system can be reduced.

For example illustrates M transmit antenna elements at an LTE eNodeB with K active UEs A B K and L in an eNodeB coverage area. At eNodeB msymbols q m 1 . . . mA C and M can be precoded with a precoder by morthonormal basis functions A C and M. In general mcan be less than or equal to M but for illustration purposes m M is assumed. Each can be an Mx1 vector which can rotate symbol qin a specific direction. In an example symbol qcan be a complex valued modulation symbol from a mapper.

At the k th UE with a channel vector H 1 M the received signal can be corrupted by white complex Gaussian noise V so the received signal can be represented by Expression 1 for k 1 . . . K where t is a symbol index and n is a subcarrier index. For notation simplicity reference to t and n is drop herein.

As illustrated in the transmit beamforming from the eNB can attempt to create M narrow beams A E aligned with channel directions of active users A C J L and N. As part of beamforming side lobes can also be generated. Side lobes can be lobes e.g. local maxima of a far field radiation pattern that are not the main lobe i.e. the main beam from beamforming . The specific set of orthonormal functions can be known to the UEs through certain signaling mechanism from the eNodeB such radio resource control RRC signaling. Without the prior knowledge of CSI for each UE the eNodeB and the UEs can perform beam generation and selection to identify a best beam with an improved signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR for a given user k K.

At each UE with the knowledge of both and RS m 1 . . . M the UE can assume RSis the desired symbol then calculate a signal to interference plus noise ratio represented by Expression 2 where SNRis the signal to noise ratio of the received pilots from the eNodeB.

With a set of m SINRs at each UE k UE k can compute or calculate maxSINR and forward e.g feedback the UE s quantized value to eNodeB and the maxSINR s related index m . The quantized value can be transmitted in a CQI. For example the maxSINR s related index in can be represented by m and the maxSINRcan be presented as SINR .

Quantization is the process of mapping a large set of input values to a smaller set such as rounding values to some unit of precision. A device or algorithmic function that performs quantization is called a quantizer. The round off error introduced by quantization is referred to as quantization error. For example an optimal beam may be quantized to a discrete index of the optimal beam such as a precoding matrix indicator PMI . In another example a signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR for an optimal beam may be quantized to a discrete SINR value such as a channel quality indicator CQI .

The PMI can be a signal fed back by the UE to support a multiple input multiple output MIMO operation. The PMI can correspond to an index of the precoder within a codebook shared by the UE and eNodeB which can maximize an aggregate number of data bits which can be received across all downlink spatial transmission layers. The CQI can be signaled by a UE to the eNodeB to indicate a suitable data rate such as a modulation and coding scheme MCS value for downlink transmissions which can be based on a measurement of the received downlink signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR and knowledge of the UE s receiver characteristics. A signal to noise and interference ratio SINR or signal to interference ratio S I or SIR also known as the carrier to interference ratio C I CIR refers to the quotient between the average received modulated carrier power S or C and the average received co channel interference power I i.e. cross talk from other transmitters than the useful signal .

After the node receives the feedback from the UEs the node can order the received maxSINRrelative to each other for the plurality of beams.

In a downlink DL data transmission phase to maximize sum rate the eNodeB can allocate DL capacity to UEs with a best SINR for the UEs with a same best beam index m or apply simple random selection. illustrates a scheduling priority among the K user equipments UEs A E and L due to random beamforming RBF . UE 5 E UE1 A and UE K L can have a maximum SINR for beam direction A in a set where UE 5 has a higher maximum SINR than UE 1 and UE K. Likewise UE 2 B can have a higher maximum SINR than UE4 D for beam direction C and UE 3 C can have a maximum SINR for beam direction M. No UE may report a maximum SINR for beam direction B. The eNodeB can schedule data transmission for UE 5 with beam direction UE 2 with beam direction and UE 3 with beam direction .

Referring back to the eNodeB can schedule the best UEs for data transmission . Then the eNodeB can resume training for a next time interval by switching to a new set where at least one beam in the new set has a different beam direction than beams the set.

For illustration purposes displays how a best beam for user k K is identified for a case of a 2 antenna transmission. The projection of user k channel onto the two basis functions can determine the signal and interference components for a given beam direction e.g. or . In the example of H relates to a power of a desired signal assuming is used for a transmission to UE k and thus H can be the interference from beam which is being used for UE 1 A. As shown and visualized in the a nearest coordinate can result in the best beam direction. In another set beam direction can be a nearest coordinate to UE 1 or UE k.

In deploying massive node antennas e.g. LTE random beamforming can be extended to handle limited overhead and feedback. In an example the beam selection phase can occur during minimum time and frequency variation such as a within a time frequency tile smaller than or equal to a coherence bandwidth BW by coherence time product e.g. coherence bandwidth X coherence time of the channel as depicted in . The tile in a resource grid can be represented by two dimensional 2D region of PRB 0 2 and subframes SF 0 1 e.g. 2 subframes 3 PRBs . In the example a frequency first mapping of the RS to beams can be used where PRB 0 PRB 1 and then PRB 2 for SF 0 then PRB 0 PRB1 and then PRB 2 for SF 1. An alternative to the training in the 2D domain can be an optimal one dimensional 1D beam selection vertically over only frequency PRBs or an optimal 1D beam selection horizontally over time subframes. For the example shown in beam selection is provided in the 1D frequency domain over successive PRBs but a similar process can be used for 1D time domain or 2D time and frequency domains.

For example within any PRB pair up to eight beams can be trained using distinct channel state information reference signals CSI RSs of eight available antenna ports. The CSI RS can be precoded with m 1 . . . M. Typically e.g. for LTE specification Release 11 and earlier CSI RS can be transmitted without precoding. For less favorable channels e.g. channels with a low SINR one CSI RS observation per beam may not result in reliable SINR estimation therefore using more than one CSI RS resource for a given beam can result in training less than eight beams.

The number of CSI RS resources available for an allocation relative to the number of beams and poor SINRs for some beams can determine the beam selection process. For example different beam selection processes can be used when training a total of N

In a subband based PMI CQI reporting example three different beam selection processes can be distinguished where A 1.

For S R N or for wideband feedback A S R N one PMI and one maximum CQI can be generated per subband and the UE can feedback the CQI and the PMI to eNodeB.

For S R N or for wideband feedback A S R N some beams can be trained twice which implies more observations and hence better quality CQI and PMI estimates can be calculated at the UE. For other beams one PMI e.g. beam index and one CQI e.g. SINR per subband can be calculated at the UE. Then the UE can feedback the CQI and the PMI to eNodeB.

A similar procedure can be applied for wideband CQI PMI with a total of A S R as the number of trained beams for a whole band. Subband feedback can be considered as a special case of wideband feedback with A 1.

In another example a UE can be used for SINR calculation. The UE can identify a beam index by relating a RS to a beam using a RS mapping. The mapping information can be signaled to the UE by the eNodeB before taking effect e.g. before being used by the UEs . The UE can measure reference signal received power RSRP for each four CSI RS group in a case where eight CSI RS opportunities in a PRB pair have been assigned different reference signals as shown in . illustrates CSI RS R1 R8 demodulation reference signal DMRS cell specific reference signals CRS and a legacy physical downlink control channel PDCCH for a PRB pair where C denotes code division multiplexing CDM between two symbols e.g. groups R1 and R2 R3 and R4 R5 and R6 or R7 and R8 . For each group e.g. m and m 1 the UE can verify if the RSRP is greater than a noise floor. A noise floor can be used to determine when a RSRP is strong enough to provide useful data. When the RSRP for the group e.g. R1 and R2 exceeds the noise floor the UE can resolve CDM between the two indices by de spreading with a length 2 cover. Then the UE can identify beam indexes m and m 1. The UE can then calculate H and H .

When the RSRP for the group e.g. R1 and R2 does not exceed the noise floor the UE may not identify beam for the CSI RS group e.g. the two individual CSI RS in the CSI RS group which can mean the UE is well outside a width of a given beam implying near zero contribution to the interference.

When a signal power can be generated for a CSI RS the UE can collect the powers H for m 1 . . . M after exhausting the beams through the different PRB pairs. Then the UE can compute

In a multiple cell environment during beam selection a possibility of interference from adjacent cells or neighboring due to the impact from identical reference signals can potentially result in misaligned beams. In the multiple cell environment interference control on the beam training can include various mechanisms. For example multiple patterns for CSI RS can be used for greater than one reuse e.g. 20 20 10 5 different configurations for 1 2 4 8 antenna ports respectively . For a re use greater than one two options can be used. In a first option if M basis functions have been used in a given cell a constant phase shift can be applied to generate a new set to be used in the neighboring cell. illustrates the constant phase shift e.g. and . In this way a local cell can have a different set of functions from neighboring cells. In a second option a different RS permutation can be used where i and j are integers. Calculation of the SINR can depend on a specific RS mapping. Numerous permutations for the RS mapping can be used which can be communicated to the UEs prior to being used.

In another example a basis rotation e.g. beam direction phase shift can be used to improve a resolution or coverage area provided by the beamforming. For example UEs outside a propagation coverage of potentially narrow beamwidths of large transmission antenna arrays can benefit from basis rotation such as UE 2 B as illustrated in . To treat UE 2 fairly a basis rotation can be applied within a specified duration e.g. once every several tens of subframes . As a result a rotation pattern such as can be applied to cover the physical space covered by the cell. illustrates a rotation sequence. An exact sequence of basis rotation can be negotiated in advance between the node e.g. eNodeB and the UEs in the cell.

Another example provides functionality of computer circuitry of a processor and or transceiver on a user equipment UE operable to generate an improved signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR from a set of orthogonal reference signals RSs as shown in the flow chart in . The functionality may be implemented as a method or the functionality may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The computer circuitry can be configured to receive a set of orthogonal RSs from a node wherein each reference signal represents a transmission beam direction as in block . The computer circuitry can be further configured to calculate a SINR for each of the RSs in the set of orthogonal RSs to form a set of SINR as in block . The computer circuitry can also be configured to select a maximum SINR from the set of SINR as in block . The computer circuitry can be further configured to quantize the maximum SINR for the set of SINR as in block .

In an example the computer circuitry can be further configured to transmit the quantized maximum SINR and a reference signal index for the quantized maximum SINR to the node. The SINR can be represented by

In another configuration the computer circuitry can be further configured to Receive a second set of orthogonal RSs from the node where each reference signal represents a transmission beam direction the second set of orthogonal RSs differs from the set of orthogonal RSs and at least one transmission beam direction represented in the second set of orthogonal RSs is not in the set of orthogonal RSs calculate the SINR for each of the RSs in the second set of orthogonal RSs to form a second set of SINR select a maximum SINR from the second set of SINR and quantize the maximum SINR for the second set.

In another example the computer circuitry configured to receive the set of orthogonal RSs from the node can be further configured to multiple input and multiple output MIMO decode a demodulated RS that is precoded by the node. In another configuration the computer circuitry can be further configured to identify each beam index for the RS by a RS to beam mapping.

In another example the computer circuitry configured to calculate a SINR for each of the RS can be further configured to for more than four beams in each physical resource block PRB pair where the RSs are channel state information RSs CSI RSs Measure reference signal received power RSRP for each CSI RS group including CSI RSs for more than four beams de spread with a length 2 cover to resolve code division multiplexing CDM between two beam indices when RSRP is greater than a floor noise threshold identify two beam indexes for at least one of the CSI RS groups and calculate power for both beams represented by the indexes two beam indexes.

Another example provides a method for providing beam selection using orthogonal beamforming vectors at a node as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine computer circuitry or a processor for the node e.g. eNB where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The method includes the operation of generating a set of orthogonal beamforming vectors as in block . The operation of generating a set of orthogonal reference signals RSs follows as in block . The next operation of the method can be mapping the set of orthogonal RSs to beams using the set of orthogonal beamforming vectors as in block .

In an example the operation of mapping the set of orthogonal RSs to beams can further include precoding a set of modulation symbols by orthogonal basis functions. The orthogonal basis functions can use the orthogonal beamforming vectors each orthogonal basis function can rotate the modulation symbols in a specific direction and the set of orthogonal RSs can be channel state information RSs CSI RSs . The method can further include transmitting the orthogonal RSs in a beam to a user equipment UE .

In another configuration the method can further include Receiving a quantized maximum signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR from each of a plurality of user equipments UEs and a reference signal RS index for each quantized maximum SINR scheduling downlink resources for each beam using a UE with a highest quantized maximum SINR relative to other UEs and transmitting data using a beam to the UE with the highest quantized maximum SINR for the beam relative to the other UEs. The RS index can represent a beam for each UE with a best SINR for the set of orthogonal RSs the quantized maximum SINR can be received in a channel quality indicator CQI for each UE and the RS index can be determined by a precoding matrix indicator PMI received from each UE. The SINR can be represented by

In another example the method can further include Recursively generating another set of orthogonal beamforming vectors where the other set of orthogonal beamforming vectors differs from a first set of orthogonal beamforming vectors generating another set of orthogonal reference signals RSs and mapping the other set of orthogonal RSs to other beams using the other set of orthogonal beamforming vectors where the other beams differ in direction from first beams generated.

Referring back to the transceiver can be configured to receive from each of a plurality of user equipments UEs a quantized maximum signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR and a pilot index for each quantized maximum SINR. The pilot index can represent a beam for each UE with a best SINR for a set of orthogonal pilots the quantized maximum SINR can be transmitted in a channel quality indicator CQI and the pilot index can be determined by a transmitted precoding matrix indicator PMI . The processor can be configured to schedule a downlink transmission for each beam using UEs with a highest quantized maximum SINR relative to other UEs. The transceiver can be further configured to transmit data via a set of transmit antennas using a beam to the UEs with the highest quantized maximum SINR for the beam relative to other UEs.

In another configuration the processor can be further configured to select an allocation for pilots used to generate an N total number of beams via M transmit antennas. The allocation can be within a coherence time and a coherence bandwidth the coherence time or the coherence bandwidth. The coherence time is a time duration or number of subframes over which a channel impulse response varies less than a coherence time threshold and coherence bandwidth is a range of frequencies or physical resource blocks PRBs over which the channel impulse response varies less than a coherence bandwidth threshold. The coherence time threshold and the coherence bandwidth threshold may be set by measuring SINR of PRBs or subframes for a system.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.
