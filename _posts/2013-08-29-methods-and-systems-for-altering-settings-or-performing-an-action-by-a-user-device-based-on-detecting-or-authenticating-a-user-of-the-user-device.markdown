Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to detecting a user and intelligently altering user device settings.

Currently user devices such as smart phones tablets laptops etc. may provide users with the ability to perform many different actions such as accessing many types of content conducting transactions such as purchases bidding etc. However some actions such as accessing certain types of content may be inappropriate for some users such as children or minors. In such cases while parents may try to supervise and limit the types of actions children may perform on their user devices for example limit the content their children can access children may still be able to perform such actions. For example children may still be able to access inappropriate content by accident or without the parents knowledge.

Like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Embodiments of the disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows.

The following description sets forth specific details describing certain embodiments. It should be apparent to a person of skill in the art however that the embodiments described herein may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. The embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes and are not meant to be limiting. A person of skill in the art may realize other material that although not specifically described herein is within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.

According to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure a user may interact with a user device via a user input interface such as a touch screen. The user device may determine certain characteristics of a user that is using the user device. In this regard the user device may detect when a new or different user has begun using the user device. As a result user device setting such as security settings may be altered or adjusted according to the new or different detected user.

In various embodiments the user device may detect new or different users by determining or analyzing certain characteristics of a new or different user including for example determining the size of an object such as a user s extremity e.g. the user s finger that is performing actions on the user device pressure patterns applications in use facial or voice recognition etc. For example the user device may detect whether the user is an adult or a child or that a child has begun using a parent s user device. In that regard small touch points or small area traces on the user input interface may indicate that a child is using the device while larger touch points or larger area traces may indicate that an adult is using the device.

Once the user device detects that a new or different user is using the user device by determining characteristics of the new or different user that may correspond to certain types of users for example a small finger of a child versus a larger finger of an adult then one or more settings of the user device may be changed or adjusted automatically. That is if the user device detects that a new or different user is using the user device this triggers the user device setting changes. In this regard the user device settings may be changed or adjusted in a way that is appropriate for the new or different user. For example security settings may be adjusted so that content may be restricted or only certain content may be displayed on the user device if it is determined that a child is using the user device. Or in some embodiments different authentication may be required depending on the detected user. For example one result of a change of a security setting may be that the user needs to be re authenticated before certain actions are performed such as conducting transactions e.g. before purchases can be made.

According to one or more embodiments an application may be downloaded on a user device. The application as described above may detect a new or different user of the user device and as a result intelligently alter or adjust settings according to the user using the user device. Results of a setting adjustment may include for example adjusting the settings in a different way if the user device detects that a user other than a primary user e.g. the owner of the user device such as a child has begun using the user device re authenticating the user before performing certain actions on the user device or any other appropriate setting changes depending on the detected user. The application may be provided by a remote location server such as a payment provider server e.g. PayPal Inc. or eBay Inc. of San Jose Calif. USA. In other embodiments the application may be provided by a merchant server a financial institution server or any other appropriate entity server.

Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure only and not for purposes of limiting the same is a diagram illustrating an object touching a user input interface of a user device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In one or more embodiments user device may include a user capturing component for example a front facing camera an audio or voice recognition device a gesture recognition component or any other device that may aid in user recognition or identification. User capturing component may capture user identification data such as an image voice gestures etc. of a user that is using user device . In some embodiments user gestures captured by capturing component may be associated with a user s specific key password secret code etc. that is only known or is specific to the user. The user device may then process and use the user identification data according to one or more embodiments as will be described herein.

User device may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and or software configured for wired and or wireless communication over a network. For example in one embodiment user device may be implemented as a mobile device of a user in communication with a network such as the Internet or another network. In other embodiments user device may be implemented as a tablet a personal computer a wireless telephone a smart phone a personal digital assistant PDA a key fob a smart card a notebook computer a game console a digital video recorder DVR and or other types of computing devices or network devices. Furthermore user device may be enabled for NFC Bluetooth online infrared communications and or other types of communications.

User device may include one or more processors coupled to one or more memories configured to process downloading installing and or running of applications from one or more remote location servers. User device may include various applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide desired features to user device . For example in various embodiments applications may include security applications for implementing client side security features programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over a network or other types of applications.

User device may further include one or more user identifiers which may be implemented for example as operating system registry entries cookies associated with a browser application identifiers associated with hardware of user device or other appropriate identifiers. In one embodiment a user identifier may be used by a remote location server to associate user device or correspondingly a user with a particular account maintained by the remote location server.

User device may include one or more processors memories and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications data and methods described herein. For example such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable mediums such as memories or data storage devices internal and or external to various components of the system and or accessible over a network which may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example in various embodiments a network may include the Internet or one or more intranets landline networks wireless networks and or other appropriate types of networks.

Referring now to a diagram illustrates components of a user device that may detect a user and intelligently alter user device settings according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The user device components illustrated in may be included in user device illustrated in according to an embodiment.

In the embodiment of an object such as a fingertip of a user may be used to interact with a user device for example by contacting or touching a portion or an area of a user input interface such as a touch screen of user device . User device may include various components including a sensor component a processor and an output component .

Sensor component may sense a signal generated in response to an input such as a contact i.e. pressing touching pinching tapping swiping etc. by object on user input interface . For example the device may determine an object s size e.g. a fingertip size that corresponds to contact area to figure out whether an adult i.e. large fingered user or a child i.e. small fingered user is using user device . In one example contact area may have a dimension A measured across the contact area which correlates to the object s size at the point or area of contact. In this case a small dimension A for example less than about a half an inch may indicate that the object is small and may belong to a child. A larger dimension A for example half an inch or larger may indicate that the object may belong to an adult.

In an embodiment sensor component may include a capacitive sensor. Capacitive sensors and their APIs may generally all express relative capacitance. In that regard processor may map the relative capacitance to a contact e.g. pressure sensed on user input interface . For example the more pressure sensed may be equivalent to a bigger contact patch e.g. corresponding to contact area . Generally capacitive sensors work by directly measuring capacitance between a driven voltage on or near a surface user input interface e.g. on or near the surface of a touch screen and the contacting object e.g. a user s finger . Assuming that objects for example fingers have basically the same composition and are about the same distance from the sensor i.e. touching the screen the amount of capacitance measured will be proportional to a surface area of the portion of the object e.g. finger that is contacting the user input interface e.g. the touch screen .

In one or more embodiments it may be possible for modern touch sensors to sense more information about the capacitance beyond just the absence or presence of an object and or the amount of capacitance. For example in certain systems such as Android systems applications are allowed to read information from touch events including not just a two dimensional x y location of the touch but also the length of the major and minor axes of an ellipse circumscribing the sensed touch event as well as synthesized information such as pressure not actually pressure in this case but rather a floating point value that varies with the total area of a sensed touch event . By binning and analyzing different contacts or gestures e.g. single tap vs. horizontal swipe vs. vertical swipe vs. pinch it may be possible to compare the touch size profile of a known user to a current user and decide whether they are consistent or not. In embodiments herein model generation and runtime analysis of touch data or information may be done using well known and suitable machine learning and pattern matching techniques such as neural networks. An output component may output a measurement corresponding to the contact sensed e.g. pressure or in other embodiments to a region an area or a radius of a circle or simply an absolute capacitance measurement.

In another embodiment sensor component may include one or more pressure sensors. Data from the pressure sensors may be used in an analysis for example by processor to determine whether a new user is operating the user device. In that regard one user s pattern of pressure may be distinct from another user s pattern of pressure for example in the same way that different users may use different pen pressure when writing. Or in another example a child may exert less pressure than an adult when interacting via the user input interface.

While any individual contact on user input interface such as pressure touch pinch tap or swipe by an object may be harder or gentler and thus produce a larger or smaller contact patch according to embodiments herein the user device may run background processes to look for overall patterns to determine contact patch pattern information for example to determine average and median contact patch sizes the largest contact patch what the overall patterns look like in a multi touch gesture versus a single finger gesture etc.

In embodiments where an overall pattern shifts too far especially for example after a screen is unlocked after a period of non use etc. a processor such as processor may use this pattern shift as an input to decide whether to require a more rigorous identification check or authentication of the user before allowing certain user actions to take place such as purchases proceeding with a program or using certain features.

As such a user device according to one or more embodiments herein may run background or continuous authentication of a user. Advantageously a frictionless service may be provided wherein users may not have to constantly be asked for identification or authentication information such as login data or entering a PIN. Running background authentication of a user by looking for overall patterns that may indicate that the user has not changed may result in the user not being asked for identification or authentication information such as a password.

In an example where a user device may be used by a parent or a child the parent may tag individual applications as being for the child s use.

Referring back to user device may include a user capturing component . User capturing component may be a camera an audio or voice recognition device a gesture recognition device etc. Data captured by user capturing component may be used to recognize or identify a user using the user device. Such data may be processed by processor in addition to an input sensed by sensor to detect the user. For example if the user device includes a front facing camera it may be used to recognize a child or an adult or any particular user such as the owner of the user device.

Referring now to a flow diagram illustrates a method for detecting a user and adjusting user device settings according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method of may be implemented by the user device illustrated in according to one or more embodiments.

In block a user interacting via a user input interface with a user device to perform an action may be detected by determining one or more characteristics associated with the user. In that regard a user may be recognized or identified for example to be a child an adult or a specific user such as the owner of the user device. Characteristics associated with the user interacting with the user device may be determined including for example the size of a fingertip of the user contacting the user input interface e.g. a touch sensitive screen . Such characteristics may indicate the identity of the user for example a small fingertip size e.g. less than about half an inch across a light pressure on the touch screen etc. may indicate that the user is a child. A larger fingertip size e.g. more than about half an inch a stronger pressure on the touch screen etc. may indicate that the user is an adult.

In various embodiments the characteristics associated with the user may be complemented or confirmed by data captured by a user capturing component of the user device for example a front facing camera a voice recognition device a gesture recognition device etc. In this regard in addition to the user device recognizing a user that is performing an action or interacting via a user input interface e.g. by determining a size of a user s extremity the user device may also complement or confirm the identity of a user by recognizing an image of the user the voice of the user a gesture associated or only known to a particular user etc.

In block the system or application may determine whether a new or different user has been detected. As described above according to one or more embodiments capacitance sensors resistance sensors pressure sensors or any other appropriate type of sensors may sense and compare sensor information associated with particular users. For example overall patterns for one user may be different than overall patterns for another user. In one instance different users may have different contact patch sizes compared to average and median contact patch sizes e.g. a first user may have a large contact patch while a new or different user may have a small contact patch . In another instance different users may use different contact patterns for example one user may normally use multi fingers on a contact surface i.e. user input interface versus another user may normally use a single finger on the contact surface. In this regard a comparison of sensor data may occur when a shift in overall patterns occur for example after a user device restart after a screen lockout after a change of application upon capturing a change of a gesture or an image after a certain period of time or inactivity e.g. after 30 minutes after an hour etc. or periodically at certain time intervals e.g. every 30 minutes every hour etc. .

In block if a new or different user has not been detected then the user may continue to perform the action on the user device.

In block if a new of different user has been detected then one or more settings of the user device may be altered according to the new or different detected user. For example security settings may be altered or adjusted depending on who is using the user device. In one instance where the new or different detected user is a child using a parent s user device the user device settings may be adjusted so that only appropriate content is presented e.g. only G rated content. In another instance where a new or different user is detected security settings may be changed such that the new user needs to re authenticate before transactions such as purchases may be made. In an example where the same user device may be used by a parent or a child the parent may tag individual applications as being for the child s use.

Referring now to a flow diagram illustrates a method for authenticating a user according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method of may be implemented by the user device illustrated in according to one or more embodiments. Also in various embodiments the method of may be performed after a new or different user has been detected as described above with respect to the embodiment of .

In block as described above according to one or more embodiments a new or different user interacting via a user input interface with a user device may be detected by determining one or more characteristics associated with the user. Upon detecting that a new or different user is using the user device user device settings may be changed according to the detected user. For example one result may be a security change wherein the new or different user may need to be authenticated before performing certain actions.

In block the user device for example by processor illustrated in the embodiment of may determine whether the detected user is allowed to perform an action. A user of a user device may wish to perform one or more different actions as normally conducted on user devices including for example accessing certain media e.g. websites printed publications TV shows movies etc. playing a video game accessing an email account conducting transactions such as purchases bidding etc.

Users that may be allowed to perform an action may be determined based on various factors for example the user device may restrict the presentation of certain mature or otherwise inappropriate content to a user that is detected to be a child. In another example the user device may not allow a user using the user device that is detected to be a child or a user other than the owner of the user device to conduct transactions such as bidding making purchases in some examples perhaps over a certain amount e.g. above 10 20 etc. or the like.

In block if the detected user is not allowed to perform an action then the action is not performed. For example a user that is detected to be a child may not be allowed to view certain content make purchases over 20 etc.

In block if the detected user is allowed to perform an action the detected user is authenticated. And in block the action is performed.

In various embodiments a detected user that is authenticated may not need to continuously enter identifier data such as a password or PIN when an action is performed. Instead the user may be automatically authenticated as the process may repeat as indicated by the dotted arrow of . In some embodiments automatic authentication of a detected user may be set to be performed at regular time periods for example every 15 minutes 30 minutes etc.

In an example where the action performed includes streaming content to a user that is detected to be an adult the system may be set to automatically authenticate the detected user to continue performing the action without the user having to enter identifier data. In another example where the action performed includes streaming content to a user that is detected to be an adult but then at the next authentication period the user is detected to be a child for whom the streaming content may be inappropriate the action may be automatically stopped. In further embodiments different authentication may be required depending on the detected user. For example one detected user may be authenticated and allowed to perform certain actions such as making purchases over a certain amount e.g. over 500 while another detected user adult or child may be required to be authenticated e.g. recognized or required to enter identifier data to make purchases over a certain amount or may even be barred from making purchases at all.

A specific object used by a user may have specific contact characteristics on a user input interface for example pressure touch tap or swipe by the object may be harder or gentler and thus produce a larger or smaller contact patch . In embodiments herein the user device may run background processes to look for overall patterns to determine contact patch pattern information for example to determine average and median contact patch sizes the largest contact patch what the overall patterns look like in a multi touch gesture versus a single finger gesture etc.

In embodiments where an overall pattern shifts too far especially for example after a screen is unlocked after a period of non use etc. a processor may use this pattern shift as an input to decide whether to require a more rigorous identification check or authentication of the user before allowing certain user actions to take place such as purchases proceeding with a program or using certain features. Advantageously the user device may process or run background or continuous authentication of a user based on the overall patterns.

In various embodiments the system may detect a different user even when that same user is the one who is first detected using the device in the session. That is the system may detect that a user that first started using the user device is not the primary user e.g. the owner of the user device and alter the user device settings accordingly. For example a child may have accessed a parent s device such as by entering the device lock code or simply through using an unprotected e.g. no lock screen or passcode device. In that case the system may determine such as described above that the user is not the one associated with or the primary user of the device or that the user is only limited to certain content as specified by the primary device user.

Referring now to a block diagram of a system is illustrated suitable for implementing embodiments of the present disclosure including user device and a remote location server or device. System such as part of a cell phone a smart phone a tablet a personal computer and or a network server includes a bus or other communication mechanism for communicating information which interconnects subsystems and components including one or more of a processing component e.g. processor microcontroller digital signal processor DSP etc. a system memory component e.g. RAM a static storage component e.g. ROM a network interface component a display component or alternatively an interface to an external display an input component e.g. keypad keyboard touchpad voice input etc. and a cursor control component e.g. a mouse pad .
