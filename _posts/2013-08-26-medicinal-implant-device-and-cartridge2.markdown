The present invention relates to a cartridge for containing a medicament and a device for inserting the medicament in a body cavity of a mammal.

Periodontal disease is a general term for a variety of dental conditions associated with either gingivitis or periodontitis. Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gingiva or gums. It is commonly associated with poor oral hygiene and or the hormonal state of the patient. If left untreated gingivitis may develop into periodontitis.

Periodontitis is a bacterial disease in which the infection has progressed to involve the oral tissues that retain the teeth in the jawbone. With this disease the gums become red and inflamed. This condition if untreated results in damage to the ligaments and bone holding the teeth in place and formation of pockets around the teeth. As the pockets become deeper teeth loosen to a point where they may fall out. Dental practitioners determine the severity of periodontitis by measuring the depth of these pockets and reviewing x rays of the teeth and surrounding bone.

Periodontal disease involves a different treatment protocol than other oral diseases. While many oral diseases can be treated with proper hygiene fluoride pastes washes and rinses periodontal disease is often resistant to this treatment. This is because of differences between the oral and periodontal cavities. The oral cavity is essentially an aerobic environment constantly perfused by saliva. in contrast the periodontal cavity is more anaerobic and is perfused by plasma filtrate known as crevicular fluid . The growth of microorganisms within the periodontal cavity microenvironment may cause periodontal disease. As the disease progresses the periodontal microenvironment becomes more anaerobic and the flow of crevicular fluid increases.

Efforts to treat periodontal disease have met with limited degrees of success. This is because the site of the bacterial infections in the periodontal cavity are largely inaccessible to agents present in the oral cavity as well as agents provided to the oral cavity such as mouthwashes rinses and the like. Moreover the increased outflow of crevicular fluid that accompanies periodontal disease inhibits therapeutic agents placed into the oral cavity from entering the pockets.

Oral systemic administration of antibiotics has been shown to be a useful method of controlling subgingival flora in some cases. However because of side effects such as those of the digestive system oral systemic administration has had only limited use in treating periodontal disease. Oral systemic therapy also requires frequent dosing so patient compliance is frequently a problem.

Recently efforts have focused on delivering therapeutic agents directly to these pockets in some cases in a controlled release formulation. In general administration of agents directly to the pocket permits higher local drug concentrations that can be safely achieved by systemic administration. Also some agents such as growth factor must be administered directly to the target site i.e. the periodontal pocket. Also as these products are typically administered by dental professionals patient compliance is not an issue.

Administration of microparticles in dry form to the periodontal pocket by use of an apparatus has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 236 355 5 366 733 and 5 622 498 all to Brizzolara et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 682 348 to Lawter et al. the contents each of which are incorporated by reference herein. These patents disclose treating dental diseases by administration of dry microparticles to the periodontal pocket. Microparticles suitable for this purpose may have compositions as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 000 886 5 143 661 and 5 500 228 all to Lawter et al all three of these patents are incorporated by reference herein and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 236 355 5 366 733 and 5 622 498 all to Brizzolara et al. and may be produced by the methods disclosed in the aforementioned six U.S. patents.

The apparatus described in the above listed patents deliver microparticles by use of a plunger to push microparticles out of a hollow cannula. The outlet of the cannula is inserted into a periodontal pocket prior to delivery of the microparticles. During administration of microparticles with such a device there is a tendency to push the cannula outlet against tissue in the bottom of the periodontal pocket while pushing on the plunger. Tissue may block the outlet and increase the force required to push the microparticles out. At high doses of microparticles in a dry powder form the force may be too large to easily push out the medicament since the force required to expel a dry powder will increase rapidly with the length of the powder column. This effect may be overcome to some extent by increasing the interior diameter of the tip. However when it is desired to deliver microparticles to a body cavity of small dimensions such as a periodontal pocket there are limitations on the diameter of the tip. Thus there is a need for improved devices for delivering medicaments to periodontal pockets of a human or animal. There is also a need for a device that provides the ability to administer multiple doses of a medicament.

The present invention is directed to cartridges for use in a device for inserting a medicament within a body cavity of a mammal e.g. the periodontal pocket of a human or animal. The cartridge for inserting the medicament includes a housing comprising a proximal portion a distal portion and a housing slot disposed along a longitudinal axis of the housing. The housing slot has a distal end a proximal end a longitudinal axis and a transverse axis. The distal and proximal ends of the housing slots are terminated by protrusions extending across the transverse axis of the slot. The cartridge further includes a retractable chamber disposed within the housing. The retractable chamber comprises a distal internal surface an external surface and a distal lumen defined by the distal internal surface.

The cartridge also comprises a substantially stationary member disposed within the lumen of the retractable chamber. The substantially stationary member has a uniform cross section sized to provide a sliding fit within the lumen to provide for retraction of the retractable chamber about the substantially stationary member upon actuation of the device. The substantially stationary member comprises a proximal end having a substantially circular cross section and a locking tab located on and extending from the perimeter of the proximal end. The locking tab is in alignment with and disposed within the housing slot. The cartridge also includes a means for retracting the retractable chamber wherein the substantially stationary member is maintained in a substantially stationary position relative to the device and the body cavity.

Depending on the number of doses of medicament contained within the retractable chamber the housing may comprise a single or multiple housing slots. Upon activation of the device interaction of the substantially stationary member SSM locking tab with the housing slot prevents the SSM from moving forward relative to the device when medicament is administered. Upon reset of the device for administration of additional doses of medicament the SSM locking tab is urged into the next housing slot by the advancing member.

The present invention is also directed to a device for inserting a medicament within a body cavity of a mammal e.g. the periodontal pocket of a human or animal. The device includes a cartridge for containing medicament as described above. Medicament may be disposed within the chamber. The chamber may have a distal tip with a uniform. external cross section sized to fit within the body cavity. The device also includes means for activating the means for retracting the retractable chamber. The device thus is configured so that the medicament is expelled from the opening of the chamber by retraction of the chamber about the medicament and the substantially stationary member rather than by forward movement of the substantially stationary member within the chamber to force the medicament from the end of the barrel.

The device of the present invention is utilized in a method for administering a medicament to body cavity of a mammal e.g. the periodontal pocket of a human or animal including obtaining the medicament containing cartridge and the actuator for dispensing medicament attaching the cartridge to the actuator and pressing the operating level or trigger of the actuator to retract the retractable chamber while maintaining the substantially stationary member in a substantially stationary position relative to the device and the body cavity so that the medicament is expelled from the opening of the chamber by retraction of the chamber about the medicament and the substantially stationary member.

The present invention relates to devices used to administer medicaments into a body cavity of a mammal e.g. the periodontal pocket of a human or animal. The devices may contain a single dose or multiple doses of medicament for example in solid powder form as discussed herein. Such devices include a cartridge for housing a retractable chamber the retractable chamber for containing medicament and an actuator for placing the device in operation once the distal portion of the medicament containing chamber is inserted within the body cavity thus providing for delivery of the medicament within the body cavity. In certain embodiments devices may include a sealing means such as a gasket to prevent backflow of the medicament between the internal surface of the chamber and the substantially stationary member upon operation of the device. Devices of the present invention are particularly useful and advantageous for administration of a medicament to the periodontal pocket of a mammal for treatment of periodontitis.

In practice the medicament is placed within the retractable chamber and the chamber then is placed within the cartridge. The cartridge then is connected to the actuator in operational engagement. The distal tip of the retractable chamber extending beyond the distal end of the cartridge is placed within the body cavity at the desired site of delivery of medicament. The actuator then is employed in cooperation with the cartridge to retract. the chamber away from the delivery site in a direction towards the actuator. Upon retraction of the chamber the substantially stationary member hereinafter SSM within the chamber that is in contact with the medicament maintains the medicament at the delivery site thus leaving the medicament that was disposed within the tip of the chamber in the body cavity at the desired delivery site.

Cartridges used in devices of the present invention are replaceable and may include a single or multiple doses of medicament contained therein. Multiple doses are advantageous as a single cartridge may be employed to deliver medicament to multiple delivery sites prior to replacement. This is particularly advantageous for administration of a medicament to the periodontal pocket of a human for treatment of periodontitis where delivery at multiple sites often is required and discomfort of the patient may be a substantial issue.

The chamber used in devices according to the present invention may be in the form of a retractable cannulated barrel where the barrel has an outer surface and an inner surface forming the body of the barrel. The lumen of the barrel then is defined by the configuration of the inner surface. Devices also include an SSM disposed within the lumen of the barrel. The respective cross sections of the lumen of the barrel and the SSM are sized to provide a slidable fit between the inner surface of the barrel and the outer surface of the SSM. By slidable fit it is meant that co axial movement of the barrel relative to the SSM may be accomplished without use of excessive force while maintaining a spatial relationship between the inner surface of the barrel and the outer surface of the SSM so as to avoid unnecessary movement or wobbling of the SSM within the barrel. Upon activation of the device the barrel slides about the SSM in a lateral direction away from the body cavity towards the distal end of the device while the SSM itself remains substantially stationary. By substantially stationary it is meant that upon activation of the device to deliver the medicament to the body cavity the SSM remains in a substantially stationary position in relation to the device itself and to the point within the body cavity at which the medicament is being delivered. While some movement of the SSM relative to the insertion site might occur any such movement should not be sufficient to cause tissue to block the outlet of the barrel or to appreciably increase the force required to deliver the medicament at the site of insertion. This is particularly advantageous where the medicament may be in the form of a dry solid powder such as a dry microparticle powder or microspheres.

Typically but optionally additives such as diluents carriers excipients stabilizers or the like may he included in the formulation.

In one embodiment medicaments may be in the form of a particulate composition such as a dry microparticle powder composition in a sufficient treatment quantity. For example the composition can be ARESTIN minocycline Hydrochloride HCl microspheres available from OraPharma Inc. Warminster Pa. for example in a 1 mg dosage or those compositions as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 000 886 5 143 661 5 236 355 5 366 733 5 500 228 and 5 622 498 all six disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. These compositions may comprise matrices of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers in accordance with the disclosure of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 236 355 5 366 733 5 500 228 and 5 622 498.

For example dry microparticle compositions may include therapeutic agents such as antibacterials antibiotics antifungal agents anti inflammatory agents immunosuppressive agents immunostimulatory agents dentinal desensitizers odor masking agents immune reagents anesthetics antiseptics nutritional agents antioxidants lipopolysaccharide complexing agents peroxides growth factors or mixtures thereof. The therapeutic agent could also have antibiotic activity.

Exemplary therapeutic agents may be antibiotics such as tetracycline a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a tetracycline hydrates of a tetracycline and hydrates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a tetracycline. The tetracyclines may be doxycycline a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of doxycycline hydrates of doxycycline and hydrates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of doxycycline. Also the tetracycline may be minocycline a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of minocycline hydrates of minocycline and hydrates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of minocycline.

These exemplary therapeutic agents may be present in the form of particles within the medicament. They can typically range from about 0.00001 to about 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the particles or from about 1 to about 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the particles or more particularly from about 4 to about 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the particles. Alternatively the therapeutic agent may be present in the medicament as a liquid or gas.

Polymers for the aforementioned matrices may include polyglycolide poly l lactide poly dl lactide poly glycolide co lactide poly glycolide co lactide poly hydroxybutyric acid poly orthoesters poly p dioxanone and mixtures thereof. The polymers can also be block copolymers of polyglycolide trimethylene carbonate and polyethylene oxide or polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene copolymers. The polymers can also be biopolymers and their derivatives including cellulose cellulose derivatives oxidized regenerated cellulose starch gelatin chitosan and hyaluronan. These polymers may also be such that they become tacky upon contact with water.

The aforementioned particles of particulate compositions including therapeutic agents may for example have particles with diameters ranging from about 0.1 to about 1 000 microns or from about 10 to about 200 microns or from about 20 to about 120 microns.

While the figures are presented as exemplary embodiments of the inventions they are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims appended hereto. Use of the same reference symbols in different figures indicates similar or identical items.

One embodiment of the present invention is shown in . is a cross sectional side view of a distal portion of retractable chamber in the form of retractable barrel for holding a dose of medicament . Medicament is disposed in the lumen defined by the internal surface of barrel . Substantially stationary member SSM is disposed within barrel . Barrel is cannulated to allow passage co axially about SSM and has proximal and distal ends as well as a distal opening . SSM is shown to have distal face . Medicament is located in cannulated barrel and has proximal and distal interfaces. The proximal interface is in contact with distal face of SSM . The cross sectional dimensions e.g. the diameter of the lumen of barrel relative to the cross sectional dimension of SSM is such that barrel may move co axially about SSM in a sliding fit without medicament leaking between SSM and inner surface of barrel and provide for retraction of barrel around SSM . This is particularly applicable to medicaments in powder form. The cross sectional shape of SSM and lumen of barrel may be hexagonal octagonal elliptical or any other shape with a circular cross sectional shape being preferred. In one embodiment SSM has a bell shaped feature not shown on the both ends to create seals with barrel .

Suitable materials from which barrel and SSM may be formed include glasses non corrodible metals synthetic resins such as plastics and the like. These materials may be used alone or in combination. If the device components are made of glasses non corrodible metals or sterilizable synthetic resins they may be used repeatedly by performing sterilization. Preferably barrel and SSM are formed from synthetic resins such as plastics. Plastics may include polyethylene polypropylene and polycarbonate.

An alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in . is similar to except that multiple doses and are located in the lumen defined by the internal surface of barrel of retractable barrel . Additional doses of medicament may be disposed within barrel for example four or more doses. Second medicament dose has proximal and distal interfaces. Third medicament dose has proximal and distal interfaces. Second and third medicament doses and may be comprised of the same formulation as first medicament dose or of a different formulation than first medicament dose . The embodiment as shown in allows for the delivery of multiple doses of medicament.

In the embodiment now presented up to three doses of medicament may be delivered to a body cavity of a mammal. However cartridge may be modified so as to be capable of delivering one or more for example three or more doses to a body cavity of a mammal.

Barrel includes proximal end and distal end barrel extension barrel slot distal tip and means for advancing SSM when barrel is advanced such as advancing members extending from the internal surface of the barrel. Such advancing members may be for example tabs protrusions or the like which are in contact and interact with proximal end of SSM to advance SSM during reset of the device between administration of successive doses.

Housing may be made from the same materials as barrel . Housing includes proximal end and tapered distal end . Though not shown distal end of housing may have a bend of approximately 50 degrees to facilitate entry of distal tip of barrel into the body cavity. In such cases barrel will be made from a plastic and will be flexible so as to traverse the housing. Housing includes at least one housing slot disposed along a longitudinal axis of the housing. Housing slot has a distal end a proximal end a longitudinal axis and a. transverse axis. Distal and proximal ends of housing slots are terminated by housing slot protrusions which extend across the transverse axis of housing slot . shows multiple housing slots although only one is specifically labeled. Housing may include means for finger gripping which enable the barrel to be rotated. Housing may contain means for retaining a cap to protect the medicament from contamination such as snap ring located on distal end . Housing may include means for limiting the motion of barrel such as slots that align with barrel extension . Proximal end of housing may include means for attaching cartridge to an actuator not shown such as fingers with flanges which engage an undercut on the tip of the actuator.

SSM disposed within cannulation of barrel is sized to provide a sliding fit within cannulation suitable to provide for retraction of the barrel about the member upon actuation of the device. SSM has proximal end having a substantially circular cross section. Proximal end of SSM includes locking tabs located on the perimeter of and extending therefrom. Locking tabs are in alignment with and disposed within housing slot upon use of the device and serve in concert with housing slots to maintain SSM substantially stationary relative to housing while barrel is retracted. A cross sectional side view of cartridge useful in the present invention is shown in . As shown cartridge includes housing barrel disposed within housing cartridge spring disposed about barrel for enabling barrel to retract upon actuation of the device and substantially stationary member SSM disposed within barrel . Barrel is sized to fit slidably within housing . Medicament not shown in is located in cannulation of barrel . Distal end of barrel includes distal tip and distal opening . Cartridge spring biases barrel towards proximal end of housing to provide a retracting motion for barrel when actuated. Barrel slot is aligned with housing slot and locking tabs are disposed there through.

Dispensing medicament from cartridge of the present invention is effected by an actuator used in operational engagement with the cartridge. is side view of an exemplary embodiment of the medicament delivery device according to the present invention. The figure shows a device comprised of cartridge as described in and actuator . Actuator has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 682 348. to Lawter et al. the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.

Actuator is of a configuration and dimensions similar to other dental instrumentation. Actuator is formed of a sleeve with a fingergrip surrounding it. A thumb ring connected to a spring loaded shaft extends from the sleeve with the shaft held in place by a nut member that includes a threaded portion that connects to a correspondingly threaded portion on the inner wall of the sleeve . The nut member on a proximal portion includes a roughened knurled or grooved outer surface to assist the user in gripping when opening actuator is desired.

Turning also to actuator is separated into the sleeve and the shaft and associated components . The sleeve includes a proximal end and a distal end . The proximal end includes a correspondingly threaded portion along its inner wall for accommodating the threaded portion on an intermediate portion of the nut member . Moving distally in a direction away from the thumb ring there is a spring section for accommodating the spring and its proximal confinement and distal confinement specifically its head . This spring section chamber includes a reduced diameter portion that serves as a stop surface for the head of the distal confinement when the shaft is pushed distally by the thumb ring .

The distal end includes a notch or indent at the outer edge of the sleeve for receiving a corresponding nub on the cartridge to prevent the cartridge from rotating in the sleeve of actuator when the cartridge in particular its flanges see is locked in place in actuator as detailed below. Proximal of this notch is a chamber for accommodating the flanges of cartridge as pushed outward by the body of the distal confinement . The chamber terminates at a groove that typically extends continuously around the inner wall of the sleeve . The groove is typically triangular in its edges to accommodate the corresponding flanges on the fingers of cartridge upon their seating therein when cartridge is locked in actuator .

These triangular edges allow for removal of cartridge from actuator as the flanges of the fingers can slide over these edges allowing for the release of cartridge . A section for accommodating the body of the distal confinement is intermediate the groove and the spring section .

The shaft extends in the distal direction from the thumb ring to the shaft end distal end . The nut member proximal confinement spring and distal confinement formed of a head and a body are all torroidal and slidable on the shaft . When the nut member is attached to the sleeve so as to be fixed in its normal operation the nut member at its distal portion serves as a confinement for the proximal confinement when the shaft typically via the thumb ring is moved in the proximal direction outwards with respect to the sleeve . The shaft includes an outwardly extending ring at its distal end . This ring typically molded as part of the shaft is fixed and serves to limit distal movement of the distal confinement for the spring .

Actuator and all components thereof except the spring is typically made of materials such as metals and in particular surgical grade steels for example 303 Stainless Steel. The spring is typically made of metals such as surgical grade steels and for example stainless steels other then 303 Stainless Steel. Accordingly actuator including the spring is sterilizable and reusable. Actuator components may also be made by injection molding of suitable resins.

To deliver a first dose of medicament the proximal to distal force on shaft is released. As shown in cartridge spring now elongates moving barrel towards proximal end of housing . Since tabs of SSM are engaged with housing slots and housing slot protrusions SSM remains in a relative stationary position with respect to barrel as barrel moves towards proximal end of housing . The retracting motion of barrel releases medicament from distal opening of barrel delivering the first dose of medicament to the delivery site. Proximal end of SSM is engaged with first stop of advancing member .

To reset device for delivery of a second dose of medicament user exerts proximal to distal force on shaft . Shaft engaged with proximal end of barrel moves towards the distal end of housing compressing cartridge spring . Likewise SSM engaged with advancing member moves towards the distal end of housing thereby moving locking tabs into second housing slots as shown in . Cartridge spring is compressed creating a bias for moving barrel towards the proximal end of housing .

To deliver a second dose of medicament the proximal to distal force on shaft is released. As shown in cartridge spring now elongates moving barrel towards proximal end of housing . Since tabs of SSM are engaged with housing slot protrusions SSM remains in a relative stationary position with respect to barrel as barrel moves towards proximal end of housing . The retracting motion of barrel releases medicament from distal opening of barrel delivering the first dose of medicament to the delivery site. Proximal end of SSM is engaged with second stop of advancing member .

In the embodiments presented above up to three doses of medicament may be delivered to a body cavity of a mammal. However cartridge may be modified so as to be capable of delivering one or more for example three or more doses to a body cavity of a mammal.
