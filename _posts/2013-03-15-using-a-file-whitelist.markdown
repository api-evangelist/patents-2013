Referring to there is shown a plurality of actions a submit action an approve a release a download action and or a control access action . The submit action may be performed by the developer entity . The approve action and or the release action may be performed by the application server . The download action and or the control access action may be performed by the electronic device .

In operation a developer entity such as for example the developer entity may perform a submit action e.g. the submit action . In this regard the developer entity may send to an application server such as for example the application server a request to approve an application e.g. the application for release of the application in an application store. The request may comprise an application e.g. the application a representation of an application e.g. executable instructions and or code that may make the application operable on an electronic device and or application data. The application data may for example comprise a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist associated with the application e.g. the application . The application data may also comprise other developer and or application related data e.g. developer name developer identifier application version application category application executable instructions etc. .

In operation an application server such as for example the application server may perform an approval action e.g. the approval action . The approval action may be performed in response to a submit action e.g. the submit action that may have been performed at an earlier time by a developer entity such as for example the developer entity . The approval action may not immediately follow a submit action. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may have received one or more applications for approval for release in an application store from one or more developer entities e.g. developer entity . The application server may perform an approval action with respect to all or some of the one or more applications at the same time or at different times.

During an approval action the application server may for example determine whether an application e.g. the application may be approved for release in an application store. In this regard the application server may analyze the application and or the application data that may have been received from a developer entity e.g. the developer entity during for example a submit action e.g. the submit action . The analysis may be based on for example a resource manifest and or a file whitelist associated with the application where the resource manifest and the file whitelist may have been received as part of for example the application data.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may analyze the resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest to determine whether resource items associated with the resource manifest are for example necessary and or reasonable with respect to resources of an electronic device e.g. the electronic device to which an access may be requested during an operation and or execution of the application. For example a social networking application may be associated with a resource manifest that for example includes resource items corresponding to the following example resources of an electronic device network camera interface contact list system settings external storage etc. The application server may determine that for example an access to the network camera interface and or external storage resources may be necessary and or reasonable and or that an access to the contact list and or the system setting resources may not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may analyze the file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist to determine whether file items associated with the file whitelist are for example necessary and or reasonable with respect to one or more files and or file paths to which an access may be requested during an operation and or execution of the application. For example a social networking application may be associated with a file whitelist that for example includes file items corresponding to the following example files and or file paths ext photos e.g. associated with photo images on an external storage associated with a read file operation app mydata e.g. associated with the particular application s data on for example internal or external storage associated with a read and a write file operation int system e.g. associated with system files and setting on internal storage associated with a read and a write file operation int system settings myapp e.g. associated with system files and setting corresponding to the particular application associated with a read and a write file operation etc. The application server may determine that for example an access to the files and or file paths ext photos e.g. because the application requested only read file operation with respect to the files and or file paths and not for example a write file operation ext app mydata e.g. because the files and or file paths are associated with the application and not with for example other application s int system settings myapp e.g. because the files and or file paths are associated with the application and not with for example other application s may be necessary and or reasonable and or that an access to the files and or file paths int system e.g. because the files and or file paths are associated with system files and settings not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

The determination of whether an access by an application to a particular resource files and or file paths may be necessary and or reasonable may be based on a variety of criteria such as for example the type of the application the developer entity with which the application is associated the type of a resource files and or file paths to which access is requested etc.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may not approve an application which may be associated with a resource manifest where one or more resource items associated with the resource manifest correspond to a resource of an electronic device to which access by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable. For example the application server may not approve the example social networking application because for example access to the contact list and or the system settings resources of an electronic device may not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may not approve an application which may be associated with a file whitelist where one or more file items associated with the file whitelist correspond to one or more files and or file paths to which access by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable. For example the application server may not approve the example social networking application because for example access to the files and or file paths int system may not be necessary and or reasonable for the example social networking application.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may approve an application with a modified resource manifest. In this regard even though the application may be associated with a resource manifest where one or more resource items disapproved resource items associated with the resource manifest correspond to a resource of an electronic device to which access by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable the application server may modify the resource manifest and may remove the disapproved resource items associated with the resource manifest. For example the application server may approve the example social networking application with a modified resource manifest where the modified resource manifest may not include the resource items corresponding to the contact list and or system settings resources.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may approve an application with a modified file whitelist. In this regard even though the application may be associated with a file whitelist where one or more file items disapproved file items associated with the file whitelist correspond to a file and or file path to which access e.g. including the associated file operations by the application may not be necessary and or reasonable the application server may modify the file whitelist and may remove the disapproved file items associated with the file whitelist. For example the application server may approve the example social networking application with a modified file whitelist where the modified file whitelist may not include the file item corresponding to the file s and or file path s int system and including the read and write file operations.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may modify a file whitelist by for example removing a file item from the file whitelist and or modifying a file item on the file whitelist. A modification of a file item may comprise a modification to a file path and or one or more file operations associated with the file path. For example the application server may modify a particular file item by modifying e.g. removing adding the one or more file operations associated with the particular file item. For example the application server may remove delete a write file operation and or it may retain the read file operation with respect to the file path associated with the particular file item.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure during an approval action the application server may communicate application receipt data to the developer entity associated with that application . In this regard the application receipt data may comprise data and or information indicative of whether the application was approved for release in an application store.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may approve an application with a modified resource manifest and or file whitelist as previously described automatically and or conditionally. For example in an automatic approval the application server may approve an application with a modified resource manifest and or file whitelist based on for example only a submit action e.g. the submit action . For example in a conditional approval the application server may communicate to a developer entity e.g. the developer entity data and or information indicating that the application may be approved for release in an application store if the developer entity approves the modified resource manifest and or the modified file whitelist. The data and or information may be a part of an application receipt data.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure when an application e.g. application was not approved and or was conditionally approved for release in an application store the application receipt data may comprise data and or information indicative of for example one or more reasons for denial to release the application in an application store. For example the one or more reasons for denial may be related to a resource manifest e.g. resource manifest and or file whitelist e.g. file whitelist associated with the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application receipt data may comprise for example an option and or instructions to automatically and or manually modify a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist associated with the application such that the application may be in a condition for approval for release in an application store as a result of the modification s . The option may be associated with the conditional approval as previously described e.g. an approval of an application with a modified resource manifest and or a modified file whitelist .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure an example automatic option to modify a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist associated with the application may be associated with for example providing an automated method for the developer entity to send to the application server a request to automatically modify the resource manifest and or the file whitelist based on for example modifications proposed by the application server that may have been communicated to the developer entity along with for example the application receipt data. For example the application server may communicate to the developer entity a message including for example a hyperlink and or any other method that may allow the developer entity associated with the application to send a request to the application server to automatically modify the resource manifest and or the file whitelist.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the message may be an e mail message. The e mail message may comprise for example a representation of a proposed resource manifest modification and or a proposed file whitelist modification that may bring the application into a condition for allowance for release in the application store. The e mail message may provide an option to the developer entity to respond to the proposed resource manifest and or the proposed file whitelist modification. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the option may be an option to automatically modify the resource manifest and or the file whitelist by replacing the resource manifest and or the file whitelist with the proposed resource manifest and or the proposed file whitelist respectively and or by accepting modifications to the resource manifest and or the file whitelist.

The option may be in a form of for example a hyperlink a shortcut and any other method that would facilitate an automated e.g. without custom user input communication between the developer entity and the application server . For example if the option is in a form of a hyperlink the developer entity may process the hyper link e.g. automatically though an API that may allow communication between the developer entity and the application server manually though a user interaction selecting and or interacting with the hyperlink etc. . The processing of the hyperlink may cause the developer entity to send to the application server a message such as for example an automatically generated e mail and or any other communication that may be received and or processed by the application server .

In another example embodiment of the disclosure the option may be in a form of a text communication. For example the text communication may direct the developer entity to for example log into a developer account associated with the developer entity . It is to be understood that the text communication may also include for example an option to automatically log into the developer account by for example opening a developer interface e.g. a web browser interface etc. and or re directing to a developer interface that may provide an option for the developer entity to respond to the proposed modifications to the resource manifest and or the file whitelist.

In operation an application server such as for example the application server may perform a release action e.g. the release action . The release action may be performed in response to an approval action e.g. the approval action that may have been performed at an earlier time by the application server .

During a release action the application server may release an application e.g. the application to an application store. The application may be released to an application store if for example the application was approved for release during an approval action e.g. the approval action .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure during a release action the application server may send application receipt data to the developer entity associated with that application . In this regard the application receipt data may comprise data and or information indicative of whether and or when the application may be released in an application store.

In operation an electronic device such as for example the electronic device may perform a download action e.g. the download action . The download action may be performed in response to for example a request by the electronic device e.g. through user input to for example download and or purchase an application e.g. the application . The download action may be performed with respect to one or more applications e.g. the application that may be available in an application store e.g. an application store managed and or supported by an application server such as for example the application server and or suitable for consumption of the electronic device e.g. supported by the electronic device the electronic device s operating system etc. .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure when an application e.g. the application is downloaded to an electronic device the application may be downloaded with an associated resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or an associated file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the contents e.g. items of a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist associated with an application e.g. the application that for example is intended to be downloaded to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may be revealed to a user of the electronic device for example before and or after the application is purchased and or downloaded. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the contents may be available for review to the user when the user requests the review e.g. though an interface associated with an application store and or a graphical user interface GUI that may allow the user to review the application change the applications settings etc. 

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a user of an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may have a full and or limited control over resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist associated with an application e.g. the application installed on e.g. downloaded to the electronic device . For example the user may be able to modify the contents e.g. items of the resource manifest and or the file whitelist after an application was downloaded e.g. the download action to the electronic device.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the user may be able to for example toggle e.g. enable disable allow disallow turn on off etc. access by an application e.g. the application to a particular resource e.g. an item associated with the resource manifest and or a particular file and or file path e.g. an item associated with the file whitelist . A user may be able to toggle access at various times such as for example when an application is downloaded to the electronic device e.g. the download action when the application request access to a particular recourse file and or file path e.g. a user may be presented with a prompt to allow and or deny access and or at any other time e.g. by accessing settings associated with the application . The toggle action may provide a user with a customized access approval process to resources filed and or file path that may have been previously evaluated and or approved by an application server e.g. the application server during for example an application approve e.g. the approve action and release e.g. the release action process.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the user may be able to for example toggle access permissions to a particular file item and or toggle file operation permissions associated with a file path of the particular file item. For example a user may turn off access to a particular file item including any file operations associated with the file path of the file time. In another example a user may turn off write file operation e.g. and keep read file operation turned on for the file path associated with the particular file item.

In operation an electronic device such as for example the electronic device may perform a control access action e.g. the control access . The control access action may be performed in response to for example a request by an application e.g. the application running and or executing on an electronic device to access a particular resource on the electronic device a particular file and or file path.

For example the control access action may be performed when an application requests access to a particular resource of an electronic device such as for example external storage. During the control access action the electronic device may detect that an application requested access to the external storage. The electronic device may determine whether the application may be granted access to the external storage by analyzing a resource manifest associated with the application. For example if one of the resource items of the resource manifest corresponds to the external storage the electronic device may grant the application access to the external storage.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure when an application requests access to the external storage and for example is granted such access based on a resource manifest the electronic device may determine to what particular file and or file path the application requests access. For example the application may request to access an example file and or file path resource ext app mydata . In this regard the electronic device may analyze a file whitelist to determine whether the particular file and or file path corresponds to one or more file items. Specifically the electronic device may determine whether the example file and or file path resource ext app mydata corresponds to a particular file path of a particular file item. The electronic device may also analyze the determined particular file item to determine whether the particular access action e.g. read write etc. corresponds to a file operation associated with the file path of the particular file item. If the example file and or file path resource ext app mydata correspond to a file path of a particular file item and the requested access action corresponds to a file operation of the particular file item access to the example file and or file path resource ext app mydata may be granted. Otherwise the access to example file and or file path resource ext app mydata may be denied e.g. even if the application may have been granted access to the external storage based on the resource manifest associated with the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a malicious application e.g. an application intended to compromise security of an electronic device and or data including personal user data may be prevented from compromising security of an electronic device on which it is installed e.g. to which it is downloaded and or on which it executes and or of sensitive data and or personal user data e.g. e mail account information passwords contact list etc. . In this regard when a malicious application e.g. the application is submitted e.g. the submit action by a developer entity e.g. the developer entity to an application server e.g. the application server for an approval for release in an application store the application may have to be associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a file whitelist the file whitelist . During an approval process e.g. the approval action the application server may determine that the application submitted for approval is malicious based on the content e.g. items of the resource manifest and or the file whitelist. The application server may not approve the application for release in an application store based on the determination that the application is malicious.

In an example embodiment of the discourse a well intentioned application e.g. a non malicious application may be compromised after it has already been approved for release e.g. the approve action and or released e.g. the release action to an application store. For example a well intentioned application may be downloaded e.g. the download action to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device . The well intentioned application may be compromised by for example another application a code bug in the well intentioned application and or another application etc. In this regard when the compromised well intentioned application requests access to a malicious file and or file path e.g. due to malicious activity affecting the application the electronic device may not approve access to the malicious file and or file path. Specifically when the well intentioned application was approved for release and or released to an application store it may have been associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest and or a file whitelist the file whitelist . Because the application was well intentioned the file whitelist may not include a file item corresponding to the malicious file and or file path. The electronic device during for example an access control action e.g. the access control action may determine that the malicious file and or file path does not correspond to any file items associated with the file whitelist and may not approve the application to access the malicious file and or file path.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a well intentioned application as previously described may be compromised by accessing an approved file and or file path e.g. a particular file and or file path that may correspond to a file item on the file whitelist associated with the well intentioned application where the approved file and or file path may have been compromised itself by for example a malicious attack on an application associated with the approved file and or file path. For example an access to a particular approved file and or file path may result in a re direct e.g. via a symbolic link to a malicious file and or file path.

In this regard the electronic application may approve the well intentioned application s request to access the particular file and or file path e.g. where the particular file and or file path corresponds to a file path of one or more file items associated with a file whitelist associated with the well intentioned application . The electronic device may monitor the well intentioned application s access to the particular file and or file path e.g. ext app mydata . In this regard the electronic device may determine that for example an access to the particular file and or file path e.g. ext app mydata resulted in a re direct from the particular file and or file path e.g. ext app mydata to a malicious file and or file path e.g. int system for example because the particular file an or file path and or the application was compromised. The electronic device may prevent the well intentioned application s access to the malicious file and or file path by for example not approving the well intentioned application s access to the particular file and or file path that may correspond to one or more approved file items e.g. file items associated with the file whitelist associated with the well intentioned application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the electronic device may for example determine that the malicious file and or file path e.g. int system corresponds to internal storage resource based on the int contained in the malicious file and or file path. Access to the internal storage may not be granted if the internal storage does not correspond to any resource items on a resource manifest associated with the well intentioned application. Furthermore even if internal storage does correspond to at least one item on the resource manifest associated with the well intentioned application access to internal storage e.g. a specific access action such as for example read or write file operation etc. may be denied because for example the malicious file and or folder path does not correspond to any file items on a file whitelist associated with the well intentioned application. Also even if the malicious file and or file path does correspond to at least one file item on a file whitelist associated with the well intentioned application e.g. because the file whitelist was compromised access to the malicious file and or file path e.g. int system may be denied. In this regard the electronic device may determine that a file operation associated with accessing the malicious file and or file path e.g. int system does not correspond to any file operation of a file item in the file whitelist.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the electronic device may prevent read and or write access to a file whitelist and or resource manifest in order to prevent malicious activity. Furthermore even if a malicious activity results in a modification of a file whitelist and or resource manifest the electronic device may request from an application server e.g. the application server an updated and or current file whitelist and or resource manifest associated with the particular application. For example such a request may be periodic e.g. performed on a lapse of a predetermined amount of time from last request on an occurrence of a predefined condition etc. . In another example such a request may be triggered when for example the electronic device detects a re direct request.

In an example embodiment of the disclosure an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may monitor resource s of the electronic device to determine whether a particular application e.g. application requested access to a particular resource. For example the electronic device may monitor resource s of the electronic device and may detect that a particular application is attempting to access a particular resource. In this regard the electronic application may grant access to the particular resource e.g. if the particular resource corresponds to a resource item associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest associated with the application .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the electronic device e.g. the electronic device may monitor a resource of the electronic device associated with for example storage e.g. internal external etc. to determine whether a particular application e.g. application requested access storage. If the particular application requested access to storage the electronic device may monitor the particular application and or storage to determine whether the application requested access to a particular file and or file path. For example the electronic device may detect that a particular application is attempting to access a particular file and or file path. In this regard the electronic application may grant access to the particular file and or file path e.g. if the particular file and or file path corresponds to a particular file item associated with a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist associated with the application and the requested access action e.g. read file operation write file operation etc. corresponds to a file operation associated with the particular file item .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may monitor applications on the electronic device to determine whether a particular application e.g. application requested access to a particular resource file and or file path. The monitoring may be ongoing and or continuous e.g. monitoring of some or all active application and or may occur at pre defined time intervals and or on an occurrence of a pre defined condition e.g. a lunch and or execution of an application a request to access a particular resource etc. . In this regard the electronic application may grant access to the particular resource e.g. if the particular resource corresponds to a resource item associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest associated with the application and or file and or file path e.g. if the particular file and or file path corresponds to a particular file item associated with a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist associated with the application and the requested access action e.g. read file operation write file operation etc. corresponds to a file operation associated with the particular file item .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure a request by an application e.g. the application to access a particular resource file and or a file path may be generated by the application and or may occur in response and or as a consequence of the application execution of a particular function. For example an application may request access to a particular resource file and or a file path before it accesses the particular resource file and or a file path and or at the time of accessing e.g. attempting to access the particular resource file and or a file path. In another example embodiment of the disclosure the application may initiate execution of a function which for example may in turn require access to a particular resource file and or a file path. In another example embodiment of the disclosure the application may call a system function e.g. associated with for example an operating system of the electronic device that may be associated with a particular resource file and or a file path. The disclosure is not limited to any particular implementation of accessing a resource file and or a file path and or requesting access to a particular resource file and or a file path etc.

In an example embodiment of the discourse an electronic device e.g. the electronic device may communicate with an application server e.g. the application server and or a developer entity e.g. the developer entity associated with an application that may have been compromised to notify the application server and or the developer entity of the suspicious e.g. malicious etc. activity by the application.

The application server may e.g. the application server in response to the communication about the suspicious activity and or a pre determined number of communications regarding the same application communicate with the developer entity e.g. the developer entity associated with the application to notify the developer entity that for example the application may have been compromised e.g. due to a bug in application code due to an attack on the application etc. .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may provide and or manage developer registration services. A developer entity such as for example the developer entity may register with the registration authentication services provided by the application server by for example creating a developer account. The registration services may provide for example for a graphical user interface GUI where a user associated with the developer entity may initiate a registration process for the developer entity .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may provide and or manage developer authentication services. For example during an application approval process the application server may provide a prompt to a user associated with the developer entity for authentication data and or information. The developer entity e.g. in response to user input and or a predefined criteria may send the authentication data and or information to the application server for authenticating the developer entity .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application server may automatically authenticate the developer entity when for example the developer entity itself e.g. without a user s intervention or through a user associated with the developer entity sends a request to the application server for the application server to approve an application for releasing in an application store. In this regard when the application server receives the request the application server may verify the identity of the developer entity . For example the application server may initiate and or perform a search on a developer database to determine whether the developer entity corresponds to a particular developer entity and authenticate the particular developer entity based on the correspondence.

Although actions and or may have been illustrated in sequence the present disclosure is not limited in this way. For example an application may be submitted e.g. the submit action by a developer entity to an application server and the application server may not immediately respond to the submit action with for example an approval action e.g. the approval action . For example the application server may proceed with approving or disapproving applications from release in an application store based on the submit actions in sequence e.g. first in first out etc. and or based on application priority e.g. an application associate with for example a particular category particular developer entity etc. may have priority over another application associated with a different category and or a different developer etc. .

The application e.g. the application may be associated with a resource manifest e.g. the resource manifest as depicted in and or described with respect to and or a file whitelist e.g. the file whitelist as depicted in and or described with respect to .

The resource manifest may comprise one or more resource items such as for example the resource item s . A resource item e.g. resource item s may correspond to a resource on the electronic device e.g. the electronic device on which the applications is operating. Example resource item s may comprise example resource items s . The resource item s may comprise resource items 1 though N e.g. Item 1 Item 2 . . . Item N . An example Item 1 may correspond to network e.g. an internet network a Wi Fi connection a LAN connection etc. . An example Item 2 may correspond to internal storage e.g. int . An example Item N may correspond to external storage e.g. ext .

The file whitelist may comprise one or more file items such as for example the file item s . A file item may comprise a file path and one or more file operations associated with the file path. The file path s define file s and or file path s to which the application may request access though an access action e.g. read file operation write file operation etc. . The file operation s define access actions that may be approved with respect to a particular file path with which they are associated. The access may be facilitated by the electronic device e.g. the electronic device if for example access to storage e.g. internal storage external storage etc. is granted to the application by the electronic device. Example file item s may comprise example file items s . The file item s may comprise file items 1 though N e.g. Item 1 Item 2 . . . Item N . An example Item 1 may correspond to an example external storage file and or file path ext app mydata associated with a read file operation rd and a write file operation wr. An example Item 2 may correspond to an example external storage location ext photos associated with a read file operation rd. An example Item N may correspond to an example internal storage location int system myapp associated with read file operation rd and a write file operation wr. 

In operation the applications may request from the electronic device to access a particular file and or file path through an example request and or . The electronic device may receive and or process the request through for example a resource control module such as for example the resource control module RCM as depicted in and or described with respect to .

In an example embodiment of the disclosure the application may request to access one or more files and or file paths e.g. request s . For each of the example file and or file path access requests e.g. the RCM may analyze the resource manifest . The RCM may determine that for the example request and or the application may be granted access to external storage based on the resource Item N which corresponds to external storage. The RCM may determine that for the example request the application may be granted access to internal storage based on the resource Item 2 of the resource item s which corresponds to internal storage.

In the example access request the application may request read access e.g. read file operation on an example external storage file and or file path ext photos . The RCM may analyze the file whitelist and may determine that the application may be granted read access to the example external storage file and or file path because for example the example external storage file and or file path corresponds to a file path of the example file Item 2 which is also associated with a read file operation. In another example not shown if the application requested write access e.g. a write file operation to the same example external storage file and or file path the RCM would deny the write access because the file path of the a file item corresponding to the example external storage file and or file path the file Item 2 of the file item s is associated with a read file operation and not with a write file operation.

In the example access request the application may request read access e.g. read file operation on an example external storage file and or file path ext app mydata data.txt . The RCM may analyze the file whitelist and may determine that the application may be granted access to the example external storage file and or file path because for example the example external storage file and or file path corresponds to a pattern of external storage file and or file path corresponding to a file path example file Item 1 of the file item s which is also associated with a read file operation. In an example embodiment of the disclosure the RCM may monitor the external storage access by the application to for example determine whether the access to the example external storage file and or file path ext app mydata data.txt results in fact in access to the same example external storage file and or file path. In a case where for example upon access to the approved example external storage file and or file path e.g. ext app mydata data.txt a redirect e.g. intermediate redirect request such as for example via a symbolic link occurs the RCM may detect the redirect e.g. to int system and may analyze whether the redirect may result in access to a file and or file path that may correspond to an approved file item. In this example the RCM may determine that the redirect request may result in access to an example internal storage file and or file path int system . The RCM may analyze the file whitelist and may determine that the application may not be granted read access on the example redirect internal storage file and or file path because for example the example redirect internal storage file and or file path does not corresponds to a file path of any of the example file item s .

In the example access request the application may request write access e.g. write file operation on an example internal storage file and or file path int otherapp settings.txt which may be associated with a different application. The RCM may analyze the file whitelist and may determine that the application may not be granted write access to the example internal storage file and or file path because for example the example internal storage file and or file path does not corresponds to a file path of any of the example file item s .

In an example step a request to approve an application for release in an application store may be received. The request may be received from an application developer e.g. a developer entity such as for example the developer entity . The request may comprise the application and or application data. The application data may comprise a resource manifest and or a file whitelist.

In an example step the request may be analyzed based on for example the application data. For example the resource manifest and or the file whitelist may be analyzed. In this regard a determination may be made whether contents e.g. items of the resource manifest and or the file whitelist may be necessary and or reasonable with respect to for example the application type category etc.

In an example step a determination whether the application may be approved for release in the application store may be made based on for example the determination made in the example step . For example if the resource items associated with the resource manifest and or the file items associated with the file whitelist are necessary and or reasonable the application may be approved for release in the application store. The present disclosure is not limited to the steps in the example method .

In an example step a request to access a particular file may be received from an application. For example an application running and or executing on an electronic device may request access to a particular file and or file path.

In an example step a determination of a resource associated with the particular file may be made. For example a particular file and or file path may be associated with external storage. In this regard the determination may be made that access to the particular file and or file path requires access to external storage e.g. external storage may correspond to a resource on the electronic device .

In an example step a determination of a resource manifest associated with the application may be made. The resource manifest may comprise one or more resource items where some or all of the one or more resource items may correspond to one or more resources of the electronic device e.g. camera interface contest list network internal storage external storage memory card storage SD card storage etc. .

In an example step a determination of whether the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource items may be made. In this regard the resource determined in the example step may be compared with one or more resource items in the resource manifest to determine whether the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource items. For example if the resource determined in the example step is external storage e.g. access to the particular file and or file path requires access to external storage and for example one of the one or more resource items also corresponds to external storage then a determination may be made that the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource item e.g. an resource item corresponding to external storage .

If the resource corresponds to at least one of the one or more resource items the example steps continue at the example step . If the resource does not correspond to any one of the one or more resource items the example steps continue at the example step .

In an example step a determination of a file whitelist associated with the applications may be made. The file whitelist may comprise one or more file items.

In an example step a determination whether the particular file corresponds to a file path of at least one of the one or more file items may be made. In this regard the particular file and or file path to which access may have been requested in the example step may be compared with one or more file paths corresponding to the one or more file items in the file whitelist to determine whether the particular file and or file path corresponds to a file path of at least one of the one or more file items. If the particular file corresponds to a file path at least one of the one or more file items the example steps continue at the example step . If the particular file does not correspond to a file path of any one of the one or more file items the example steps continue at the example step .

In an example step a determination whether an access action corresponds to at least one file operation of the file path determined in the example step . In this regard the access action e.g. read file operation write file operation etc. may be compared with one or more file operations of the file item corresponding to the file path determined in the example step . If the access operation corresponds to at least one file operation of the file item corresponding to the file path determined in the example step the example steps continue at the example step . If the access operation does correspond to any one file operation of the file item corresponding to the file path determined in the example step the example steps continue at the example step .

In an example step the request to access the particular file may be granted. For example the application may be allowed to access the particular file.

In an example step the request to access the particular file may be denied. For example the application may not be allowed to access the particular file. In an example embodiment of the disclosure a notification may be presented to a user of the electronic device to inform the user that the application requested to access the particular file and that the access to the particular file was denied. The notification may comprise information relating to a reason why the application was denied access to the particular file. The notification may comprise an option for the user to request from the electronic device to bypass application permission e.g. as defined by the resource manifest and or the file whitelist associated with the applications and allow access to the particular file e.g. even if the particular file may not correspond to a file path any one of the file items associated with the file whitelist . The present disclosure is not limited to the steps in the example method .
