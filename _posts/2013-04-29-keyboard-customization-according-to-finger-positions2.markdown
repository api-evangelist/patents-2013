Conventional physical or virtual typing keyboards typically include keys or tiles having a predetermined size located at fixed positions within a typing keyboard layout. The keys are generally arranged in a grid like configuration. Users of such keyboards generally possess different hand morphologies and vision capabilities. Accordingly use of conventional physical and virtual keyboards may present difficulties for such users.

The disclosure recognizes and addresses in at least one aspect the lack of customization of virtual keyboards in user equipment based at least on features specific to an end user. In particular but not exclusively the disclosure recognizes and addresses the issue of conventional physical or virtual keyboards having keys that are uniform in size and that are placed at fixed positions in a keyboard typing layout. The fixed sizes and positions of keys in a conventional physical or virtual keyboard commonly fail to adequately address the wide range of hand sizes individual finger positions and or hand orientations possessed by a wide range of end users. In addition the disclosure recognizes that in certain user equipment such as mobile devices with limited display real estate conventional virtual keyboards may fail to adequately accommodate keyboard layouts. The disclosure further recognizes that the lack of physical buttons in a virtual keyboard may make it difficult for visually impaired users to correctly position their hands and or fingers on such a keyboard.

As described in greater detail below the disclosure provides various embodiments for customization of a keyboard layout associated with a keyboard. In the present disclosure a keyboard can comprise information e.g. digital information such as data or metadata and or analogic information configured to represent or otherwise indicate a plurality of keys or tiles arranged in a specific keyboard layout. Specific portions of such information and or a rendering thereof may be referred to as indicia or keys. The keyboard layout can be representative or otherwise indicative of the typical arrangement of keys of a common keyboard that typically is included in user equipment such as a tablet computer a smartphone a gaming console a navigation console or the like. In addition or in the alternative the keyboard layout which herein also may be referred to as the keyboard can be indicative or otherwise representative of any arrangement of input source keys arranged in a specific spatial configuration that can permit an end user to provide input e.g. information via such keys to the user equipment or other computing device that includes the keyboard layout or keyboard . In certain aspects of the disclosure a keyboard layout can be customized based at least in part on an end user s finger positions on a surface such as a display surface associated with user equipment operated or otherwise manipulated by the end user. Each of the finger positions can have associated thereto a respective point of contact on the surface. Finger positions or associated points of contact on a surface can be utilized to customize a keyboard layout as described herein. The disclosure also provides typing techniques that utilize or otherwise leverage a keyboard layout customized in accordance with various aspects described herein.

In certain embodiments the disclosure can detect a set of finger positions on a surface of a display of user equipment. The finger positions may be associated with a typing action via which an end user may interact with the user equipment. An arrangement e.g. a spatial configuration or structure of the set of finger positions can be determined and based at least on the determined arrangement the disclosure can generate a layout of keys of a keyboard or a keyboard layout . In certain aspects such a layout can be generated dynamically in response to changes in the set of finger positions where the changes can originate from a change in the end user that interacts with the user equipment and or a relocation of one or more hands of the end user. In addition the layout of keys of the keyboard can be utilized or otherwise leveraged in scenarios in which a keyboard layout is likely to be poorly perceived e.g. the end user is visually impaired . In such scenarios the disclosure provides a typing technique that relies upon a determination of relative arrangements of finger positions associated with a series of typing actions by an end user during typing. While various embodiments of the disclosure are illustrated in the context of a keyboard layout other layouts of keys e.g. numeric keypads or media assets such as pictures or thumbnails can be customized in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure.

In connection with the drawings illustrates an example functional environment for customization of a keyboard layout in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. In such an environment an end user can interact with user equipment via a display surface of the user equipment through one or more actions which herein can be referred to as typing actions . The user equipment can be embodied in or can comprise a computing device having various computing resources such as one or more processors and one or more memory devices and various communication resources such as communication devices e.g. a system bus a memory bus or the like and or input output interface s . The user equipment can be embodied in wireless computing devices e.g. mobile computing devices including wearable computing devices or tethered computing devices.

As illustrated as part of an example typing action the end user can place a first hand e.g. left hand L and a second hand e.g. right hand R in contact with the display surface . In response to such an action the user equipment can detect a first plurality of points of contact L on the display surface associated with the typing action corresponding to the first hand e.g. hand L and a second plurality of points of contact R on the display surface associated with the typing action corresponding to the second hand e.g. hand R . It should be appreciated that in certain scenarios the first and second hands can be placed in contact with the display surface in sequence or substantially simultaneously. In one aspect each of the first plurality of points of contact is associated with a respective finger of the first hand e.g. hand L and each of the second plurality of points of contact is associated with a respective finger of the second hand hand R . In certain embodiments a typing action can be embodied in or can comprise an eight finger press where the first plurality of points of contact L has four points of contact e.g. four pressure points and the second plurality of points of contact R also has four points of contact e.g. four pressure points . In certain embodiments the first plurality of points of contact L can be associated with a home row of keys in a predetermined keyboard layout such as the keys A S D and F in a QWERTY keyboard layout and the second plurality of points of contact R can be associated with another home row of keys in the predetermined keyboard layout such as the keys H J K and L in the QWERTY keyboard layout. In other embodiments the typing action can be embodied in or can comprise a finger press having a different press degree a two finger press a three finger press a four finger press a five finger press a six finger press a seven finger press a nine finger press or a ten finger press. It should be appreciated that the press degree refers to a number N of fingers that are in contact with a surface such as the display surface where N is a natural number and 10 N 1. Accordingly the foregoing finger presses can be collectively referred to as N finger presses.

Based on the first and second pluralities of points of contact the user equipment can generate a customized layout of indicia that can be indicative or otherwise representative of a keyboard layout associated with the user equipment or a software application executed therein. At least a portion of such a layout can be rendered via the display surface . For example as illustrated in diagram indicia represented as rectangular blocks indicative of each of the first plurality of points of contact L and each of the second plurality of points of contact R can be rendered at the display surface . In addition as the end user types and thus moves a digit or finger as illustrated with an arrow in diagram to a new point of contact indicia indicative of one or more tiles e.g. key s in the keyboard layout determined to be associated with the new point of contact can be rendered at the display surface . It should be appreciated that the indicia that are illustrated in can be rendered for the benefit of the user and also can be rendered within a content processing software application e.g. a word processing application a computer assisted design application a content publishing application or the like executing on the user equipment .

In certain embodiments as part of generating the customized layout of indicia based at least on the plurality of contact points that are detected the user equipment can determine a first set of one or more distances between at least two points of contact of the first plurality of points of contact L. In addition the user equipment can determine a second set of one or more distances between at least two points of contact of the second plurality of points of contact R. As an illustration presents a diagram of an example eight finger press having a first plurality of points of contact L and a second plurality of points of contact R. As described herein the user equipment can determine at least one distance between one or more pairs of points of contact in each of such pluralities of points of contact. For example the distance between a first point of contact pand a second point of contact pcan be determined. Similarly other distances e.g. etc. between pairs of points of contacts p p p and palso can be determined. In addition or in the alternative in one or more of such embodiments the user equipment can determine an angle between a line connecting two points of contact of the first plurality of points of contact and a line substantially parallel to an edge of the display surface . For example the user equipment can determine the angle between line connecting the furthermost points of contact in the plurality of points of contact L and line parallel to the bottom edge of the display surface . It should be appreciated that the angle can be formed between the pinky finger and the pointer finger of an end user and can represent a rotation of the end user s hand e.g. hand L with respect to an edge of the display surface .

It should be appreciated that in one aspect determination of such geometrical arrangement of the first plurality of contact points L and the second plurality of contact points R can determine an arrangement of each or both of such pluralities of points of contact. Determination of such arrangement can permit customization of the layout of indicia indicative of or otherwise representative of a typewriter keyboard layout or keyboard layout associated with the user equipment or a content processing software application executing thereon. To at least such an end in one aspect the user equipment can determine a first configuration of a first plurality of indicia that is indicative of a first plurality of keys associated with a first portion of the keyboard layout. For instance the first portion of the keyboard layout can be or can comprise a home row associated with the keyboard layout e.g. the keys A S D and F in a QWERTY keyboard layout . In one aspect the user equipment can determine a respective size of each of the first plurality of indicia based at least in part on a first set of one or more distances between one or more pairs of points of contact of the first plurality of points of contact L. In addition or in the alternative in one or more embodiments the user equipment can determine an angle between a line connecting two points of contact of the first plurality of points of contact OR and the line substantially parallel to an edge of the display surface e.g. line . Moreover the user equipment can determine a relative orientation of at least one indicia of the first plurality of indicia with respect to at least one other indicia of the plurality of indicia based at least in part on the angle that is determined.

It should be appreciated that in embodiments in which a layout of indicia representative of key sizes and or positions can be dynamically generated based on hand position and or size it is possible that individual indicia may overlap e.g. conflicts may exist between indicia representative of left hand keys and indicia representative of right hand keys in a keyboard layout . Such overlap may occur when the left hand and right hand of an end user are placed in close proximity to each other during typing actions. For example the middle home row keys G and H may overlap in certain scenarios. Similarly in a scenario in which one or both hands are rotated in or out the top or bottom middle keys may overlap. It should further be appreciated that close proximity of an end user s hands during typing is likely in scenarios involving a device with limited display area.

In addition to determining a first configuration of a first plurality of indicia the user equipment can determine a second configuration of a second plurality of indicia that is indicative of or otherwise representative of a second plurality of keys associated with a second portion of a keyboard layout. For instance the second portion of the keyboard layout can be or can comprise a home row associated with the keyboard layout e.g. the keys J K L and in a QWERTY keyboard layout . In one aspect in order to determine the second configuration the user equipment can determine a respective size of each of the second plurality of indicia based at least in part on the second set of one or more distances. In addition or in the alternative in one or more embodiments the user equipment can determine an angle between a line connecting two points of contact of the second plurality of points of contact R and the line substantially parallel to an edge of the display surface e.g. line . Moreover the user equipment can determine a relative orientation of at least one indicia of the second plurality of indicia with respect to at least one other indicia of the plurality of indicia based at least in part on the angle that is determined.

In certain scenarios for example the user equipment can render the first plurality of indicia and the second plurality of indicia on a display surface wherein the first plurality of indicia in combination with the second plurality of indicia represents a complete layout of the typing keyboard layout such as the layout of a QWERTY keyboard or a QWERTZU keyboard.

It should be appreciated that in one aspect the described customization of a layout of indicia indicative or representative of a keyboard layout can be specific to the morphology of one hand or both of an end user s hands and or to the manner in which the end user interacts with the display surface . In one aspect based on the determined arrangement of points of contacts the described customization can seamlessly accommodate the size of the end user s hands via the determination of distances between the points of contact or otherwise established by the user equipment . In addition the described customization also can account for angular rotation of one or more hands of the end user. For example the end user can place both hands onto the display surface with an inwards rotation e.g. the line connecting the point of contact associated with the pinky and the point of contact associated with the pointer finger extends below the line substantially parallel to the bottom edge of the display surface . In addition or in the alternative at least one of the end user s hands can be rotated outwards e.g. the line connecting the point of contact associated with the pinky and the point of contact associated with the pointer finger extends above the line substantially parallel to the bottom edge of the display surface . As an illustration depict different arrangements of points of contact associated with different typing actions of different end users and the associated customized indicia that may be generated based thereon.

The computing device also can comprise one or more rendering units . In one aspect at least one of the rendering unit s can include a display device or display that contains a display surface such as display surface . The rendering unit can render at least a portion of the plurality of indicia. In certain embodiments the at least one rendering unit can display at least the portion of the plurality of indicia at a rendering surface e.g. a multi layer surface containing a plurality of pixels that is coupled to the display surface.

As illustrated the computing device includes a memory device also referred to as memory that can comprise information associated with customization of a layout of indicia e.g. a keyboard layout as described herein. The memory can include one or more rules to define a size e.g. height and or width of indicia indicative of a tile or key associated with an element of a keyboard layout. In addition or in the alternative the memory can include programming logic e.g. instructions that in response to execution permits determination of a location of a point of contact e.g. a pressure point in relation to one or more other points of contact. The memory also can include a set of one or more predetermined keyboard layouts such as a QWERTY keyboard layout a QWERTZU keyboard layout combinations thereof or the like which can permit the configuration unit to generate a layout of indicia according to a predetermined keyboard layout.

As described herein a layout of indicia representative of a keyboard layout can be customized to substantially any hand morphology and or typing actions relied upon to interact with a user interface of user equipment. illustrates a scenario in which an end user lacks a finger on one hand e.g. hand R . Even in the absence of such a finger the present disclosure permits generation of customized indicia representative of a virtual keyboard layout for the end user having hands such as the illustrated hands L and R.

The disclosure also permits implementation of typing techniques for visually impaired end users for example. To at least such an end in one aspect a computing device of the disclosure such as the computing device or the computing device can detect a plurality of points of contact on a display surface. The plurality of points of contact can be associated with a specific N finger press with 10 N 1 . In one aspect a component of the computing device can identify specific hand s and or finger s associated with the N finger press. For example in an embodiment in which the computing device is embodied in the computing device the configuration unit can acquire or otherwise receive information indicative of the N finger press and can identify one or more hands associated with the N finger press. In addition in certain implementations the configuration unit can identify at least one finger associated with the hand that is identified. In response to such detection the computing device can generate a layout of indicia indicative of a keyboard layout e.g. a QWERTY layout or a QWERTZU layout based on a predetermined selection of the keyboard layout. In addition the computing device can determine or configure a generalized home row for the typing technique where such home row can include a subset of the plurality of points of contact associated with a specific hand e.g. hand L. The generalized home row can include a conventional home row such as one of the QWERTY home rows A S D and F or it can comprise any finite set of predetermined characters e.g. umlaut characters and non umlaut characters foreign language characters or the like .

Based on the generalized home row the computing device e.g. computing device can detect a change in the arrangement of the plurality of points of contact and can determine an updated arrangement of points of contact. For example in a scenario in which the plurality of points of contact is associated with an N finger press the computing device can detect a transition from an arrangement associated with the N finger press to another arrangement associated with an N 1 finger press. Such a transition can originate from a typing action in which an end user lifts or releases one finger as part of a typing sequence based on a typing technique that relies or otherwise leverages the N finger press. As described herein the computing device can determine the specific finger e.g. pointer finger middle finger annular finger or pinky finger included in the transition from the N finger press to the N 1 finger press. In addition the computing device can detect a transition from the N 1 finger press to the N finger press which can be associated with the typing sequence e.g. the end user returns placement of hand s and associated fingers to the initial N finger press. It should be appreciated that as the typing sequence continues the computing device can detect various transitions between the N finger press and the N 1 finger press. As illustrated in a generalized home row can be associated with a four press home row and the typing technique e.g. touch typing can rely upon or otherwise leverage changes in one point of contact related to an initial plurality of points of contacts e.g. transitions between an 8 finger press and a 7 finger press see or transitions between a 5 finger press and a 4 finger press see .

The computing device can detect other changes in the arrangement of the plurality of points of contacts. In one aspect the computing device can detect a transition from the N finger press to an N M finger press where M is a natural number less than or equal to N 1 that represents a number of fingers lifted in a typing action or keying event. In addition the computing device can detect a transition from the N M finger press to an N P finger press where P is a natural number satisfying 1 P M 1. The N P finger press can represent a number of fingers in contact with a surface in order to type an intended key or tile. For instance in a scenario in which N 8 an end user can lift or release two fingers M 2 prior to effecting a 7 finger press P 1 in order to type the intended tile and then return to the initial 8 finger press.

As described herein the computing device can determine a difference between the first arrangement of the plurality of points of contact and the updated arrangement and in response can select a specific indicia from the layout of indicia based at least on the difference. The specific indicia can represent or otherwise indicate one of the keys or tiles in the keyboard layout relative to the generalized home row. Accordingly in one aspect such difference can represent or otherwise indicate a soft keystroke event that can permit the computing device to select the specific indicia and optionally render the content associated with the indicia that is selected. In certain embodiments the computing device can select the specific indicia based at least on a specific set of one or more fingers that are lifted prior to typing or keying a specific tile and the keyboard layout relative to the generalized home row. As an illustration for initial 8 finger press the computing device can detect a transition to a 7 finger press and the specific finger that is released. Based at least on such identification the computing device can identify a portion of the keyboard layout that is likely to include the key or tile that is intended to be pressed. In one aspect for a QWERTY keyboard layout computing device can detect a transition or change from the 8 finger press to the 7 finger press and can determine that the finger that is released is the middle finger in the end user s left hand. Based on such determination the computing device can generate the portion of the QWERTY layout that is associated with the letters E or X as one of these letters is likely to be intended to be pressed or otherwise actuated by the end user based on the determined release of the middle finger.
