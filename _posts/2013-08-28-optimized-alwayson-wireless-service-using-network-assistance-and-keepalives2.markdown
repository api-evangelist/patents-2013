The following presents a simplified summary relating to one or more aspects and or embodiments disclosed herein. As such the following summary should not be considered an extensive overview relating to all contemplated aspects and or embodiments nor should the following summary be regarded to identify key or critical elements relating to all contemplated aspects and or embodiments or to delineate the scope associated with any particular aspect and or embodiment. Accordingly the following summary has the sole purpose to present certain concepts relating to one or more aspects and or embodiments disclosed herein in a simplified form to precede the detailed description presented below.

According to one exemplary aspect the disclosure generally relates to optimized always on wireless service using network assistance and keep alives. More particularly in response to a user equipment UE requesting a bearer for an always on service a network may establish the bearer for the always on service and transmit an availability time that indicates a period during which the bearer will be held in an active state to the UE. Any applications running on the UE may then use the bearer for the always on service and the UE may transmit a single keep alive message to the network before the availability time expires to reset the period during which the bearer will be held in the active state. Furthermore the keep alive message may be structured to not generate a reply and thereby reduce battery consumption reduce communication overhead and improve network capacity.

According to another exemplary aspect a method for optimized always on wireless service may comprise monitoring requests for always on service from one or more applications or services on a UE that does not currently have always on service from a network transmitting to the network a message that requests a bearer dedicated to always on service in response to receiving a request for the always on service from at least one of the applications or services on the UE receiving at the UE an availability time that indicates a period during which the bearer dedicated to the always on service will be held in an active state and transmitting a keep alive message from the UE to the network before the availability time expires to reset the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state wherein the UE maintains the state associated with the dedicated bearer and notifies the one or more applications or services on the UE to suppress keep alive messages. For example in one embodiment the keep alive message may comprise an Internet Control Messaging Protocol ICMP message that does not generate a reply. Furthermore in one embodiment the UE may transmit one keep alive message to enable all the applications or services on the UE to utilize the bearer dedicated to the always on service in the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state or alternatively disable keep alive messages to deactivate the always on service and consequently deactivate the bearer dedicated thereto in response to all applications or services that requested the always on service indicating that the always on service is no longer required. In the latter case the method may further comprise transmitting a request to reactivate the bearer dedicated to the always on service to the network in response to the UE transitioning to a high priority state or another notification from at least one of the applications or services that requests the always on service wherein the UE may then receive an availability time that indicates the period during which the reactivated bearer will be held in the active state. Alternatively the network may reactivate the bearer dedicated to the always on service in response to receiving a high priority call that terminates at the UE which may then be received at the UE over the reactivated bearer.

According to another exemplary aspect an apparatus that may be used to optimize always on wireless service using network assistance and keep alives may comprise means for monitoring requests for always on service from one or more applications or services on the apparatus which may not currently have always on service from a network means for transmitting to the network a message that requests a bearer dedicated to always on service in response to a request for the always on service from at least one of the applications or services on the apparatus means for receiving an availability time that indicates a period during which the bearer dedicated to the always on service will be held in an active state and means for transmitting a keep alive message to the network before the availability time expires to reset the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state wherein the apparatus maintains the state associated with the dedicated bearer and notifies the one or more applications or services on the apparatus to suppress keep alive messages.

In addition the apparatus may comprise a memory coupled to the one or more processors.

According to another exemplary aspect a computer readable storage medium may have computer executable instructions that may be used to optimize always on wireless service using network assistance and keep alives recorded thereon wherein executing the computer executable instructions on one or more processors may cause the one or more processors to monitor requests for always on service from one or more applications or services on a UE that does not currently have always on service from a network transmit a message that requests a bearer dedicated to always on service to the network in response to receiving a request for the always on service from at least one of the applications or services on the UE receive an availability time at the UE that indicates a period during which the bearer dedicated to the always on service will be held in an active state and transmit a keep alive message from the UE to the network before the availability time expires to reset the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state wherein the UE maintains the state associated with the dedicated bearer and notifies the one or more applications or services on the UE to suppress keep alive messages.

According to another exemplary aspect a method for optimized always on wireless service may comprise establishing at a network a bearer dedicated to an always on service on a UE in response to receiving a request for always on service from the UE transmitting to the UE an availability time that indicates a period during which the bearer dedicated to the always on service will be held in an active state and resetting the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state in response to receiving a keep alive message from the UE before the availability time expires e.g. an ICMP message that does not generate a reply . As such the method may further comprise routing traffic associated with one or more applications on the UE over the dedicated bearer in the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state. Additionally in one embodiment the method may further comprise transmitting to the UE an Internet Protocol IP address associated with a Packet Data Network Gateway P GW that terminates an interface associated with the dedicated bearer wherein an activation message associated with the dedicated bearer may include the IP address associated with the P GW within a Protocol Configuration Option PCO information element. Furthermore in one embodiment the bearer dedicated to the always on service may be deactivated in response to the network determining that a keep alive message was not received before the availability time expired wherein the bearer for the always on service may be reactivated in response to the UE transitioning to a high priority state or requesting activity on the bearer for the always on service an availability time that indicates the period during which the reactivated bearer will be held in the active state may then be transmitted to the UE. Alternatively or additionally the bearer for the always on service may be reactivated in response to the network receiving a high priority call that terminates at the UE in which case the high priority call may be terminated at the UE over the reactivated bearer whereas a non priority call received at the network that terminates at the UE may be terminated at the UE over a default bearer.

According to another exemplary aspect an apparatus that may be used to optimize always on wireless service using network assistance and keep alives may comprise means for establishing a bearer dedicated to an always on service on a UE in response to a request for always on service from the UE means for transmitting to the UE an availability time that indicates a period during which the bearer dedicated to the always on service will be held in an active state and means for resetting the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state in response to receiving a keep alive message from the UE before the availability time expires.

In addition the apparatus may comprise a memory coupled to the one or more processors.

According to another exemplary aspect a computer readable storage medium may have computer executable instructions that may be used to optimize always on wireless service using network assistance and keep alives recorded thereon wherein executing the computer executable instructions on one or more processors may cause the one or more processors to establish a bearer dedicated to an always on service on a UE in response to receiving a request for always on service from the UE transmit an availability time that indicates a period during which the bearer dedicated to the always on service will be held in an active state to the UE and reset the period during which the dedicated bearer will be held in the active state in response to receiving a keep alive message from the UE before the availability time expires.

Various aspects are disclosed in the following description and related drawings. Alternate aspects may be devised without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally well known elements of the disclosure will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the disclosure.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration.

Likewise the term aspects of the disclosure does not require that all aspects of the disclosure include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many aspects are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. an application specific integrated circuit ASIC by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein.

In addition for each of the aspects described herein the corresponding form of any such aspects may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks Wi Fi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs 1 . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. CDMA EV DO eHRPD GSM EDGE W CDMA LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs Evolved Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of Wi Fi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs 1 . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE 4 or UE 5 over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. a Wi Fi router with wired and or wireless connectivity may correspond to the access point .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet .

Examples of protocol specific implementations for the RAN and the core network are provided below with respect to to help explain the wireless communications system in more detail. In particular the components of the RAN and the core network corresponds to components associated with supporting packet switched PS communications whereby legacy circuit switched CS components may also be present in these networks but any legacy CS specific components are not shown explicitly in .

In the core network includes the above noted SGSN B and potentially a number of other SGSNs as well and a GGSN B. Generally GPRS is a protocol used in GSM for routing IP packets. The GPRS core network e.g. the GGSN B and one or more SGSNs B is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W CDMA based 3G access networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network i.e. the core network that provides mobility management session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W CDMA networks.

The GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users e.g. UEs of a GSM or W CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the Internet as if from one location at the GGSN B. This is achieved by transferring the respective UE s data from the UE s current SGSN B to the GGSN B which is handling the respective UE s session.

Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network namely i GTP U ii GTP C and iii GTP GTP Prime . GTP U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol PDP context. GTP C is used for control signaling e.g. setup and deletion of PDP contexts verification of GSN reach ability updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another etc. . GTP is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.

Referring to the GGSN B acts as an interface between a GPRS backbone network not shown and the Internet . The GGSN B extracts packet data with associated a packet data protocol PDP format e.g. IP or PPP from GPRS packets coming from the SGSN B and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN connected UE to the SGSN B which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer RAB of a target UE served by the RAN . Thereby the GGSN B stores the current SGSN address of the target UE and its associated profile in a location register e.g. within a PDP context . The GGSN B is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for a connected UE. The GGSN B also performs authentication and charging functions.

The SGSN B is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the UEs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN B includes packet routing and transfer mobility management e.g. attach detach and location management logical link management and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN B stores location information e.g. current cell current VLR and user profiles e.g. IMSI PDP address es used in the packet data network of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN B for example within one or more PDP contexts for each user or UE. Thus SGSNs B are responsible for i de tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN B ii uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN B iii carrying out mobility management as UEs move between SGSN service areas and iv billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art aside from i iv SGSNs configured for GSM EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W CDMA networks.

The RAN e.g. or UTRAN in UMTS system architecture communicates with the SGSN B via a Radio Access Network Application Part RANAP protocol. RANAP operates over an Iu interface Iu ps with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN B communicates with the GGSN B via a Gn interface which is an IP based interface between SGSN B and other SGSNs not shown and internal GGSNs not shown and uses the GTP protocol defined above e.g. GTP U GTP C GTP etc. . In the embodiment of the Gn between the SGSN B and the GGSN B carries both the GTP C and the GTP U. While not shown in the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System DNS . The GGSN B is connected to a Public Data Network PDN not shown and in turn to the Internet via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol WAP gateway.

In the core network includes a plurality of Mobility Management Entities MMEs D and D a Home Subscriber Server HSS D a Serving Gateway S GW D a Packet Data Network Gateway P GW D and a Policy and Charging Rules Function PCRF D. Network interfaces between these components the RAN and the Internet are illustrated in and are defined in Table 1 below as follows 

A high level description of the components shown in the RAN and core network of will now be described. However these components are each well known in the art from various 3GPP TS standards and the description contained herein is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all functionalities performed by these components.

Referring to the MMEs D and D are configured to manage the control plane signaling for the EPS bearers. MME functions include Non Access Stratum NAS signaling NAS signaling security Mobility management for inter and intra technology handovers P GW and S GW selection and MME selection for handovers with MME change.

Referring to the S GW D is the gateway that terminates the interface toward the RAN . For each UE associated with the core network for an EPS based system at a given point of time there is a single S GW. The functions of the S GW D for both the GTP based and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 PMIP based S5 S8 include Mobility anchor point Packet routing and forwarding and setting the DiffServ Code Point DSCP based on a QoS Class Identifier QCI of the associated EPS bearer.

Referring to the P GW D is the gateway that terminates the SGi interface toward the Packet Data Network PDN e.g. the Internet . If a UE is accessing multiple PDNs there may be more than one P GW for that UE however a mix of S5 S8 connectivity and Gn Gp connectivity is not typically supported for that UE simultaneously. P GW functions include for both the GTP based S5 S8 Packet filtering by deep packet inspection UE IP address allocation setting the DSCP based on the QCI of the associated EPS bearer accounting for inter operator charging uplink UL and downlink DL bearer binding as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 UL bearer binding verification as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to both GSM EDGE Radio Access Network GERAN UTRAN only UEs and E UTRAN capable UEs using any of E UTRAN GERAN or UTRAN. The P GW D provides PDN connectivity to E UTRAN capable UEs using E UTRAN only over the S5 S8 interface.

Referring to the PCRF D is the policy and charging control element of the EPS based core network . In a non roaming scenario there is a single PCRF in the HPLMN associated with a UE s Internet Protocol Connectivity Access Network IP CAN session. The PCRF terminates the Rx interface and the Gx interface. In a roaming scenario with local breakout of traffic there may be two PCRFs associated with a UE s IP CAN session A Home PCRF H PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a HPLMN and a Visited PCRF V PCRF is a PCRF that resides within a visited VPLMN. PCRF is described in more detail in 3GPP TS 23.203 and as such will not be described further for the sake of brevity. In the application server e.g. which can be referred to as the AF in 3GPP terminology is shown as connected to the core network via the Internet or alternatively to the PCRF D directly via an Rx interface. Generally the application server or AF is an element offering applications that use IP bearer resources with the core network e.g. UMTS PS domain GPRS domain resources LTE PS data services . One example of an application function is the Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS Core Network sub system. The AF uses the Rx reference point to provide session information to the PCRF D. Any other application server offering IP data services over cellular network can also be connected to the PCRF D via the Rx reference point.

In the eHRPD RAN includes a plurality of base transceiver stations BTSs E E and E which are connected to an enhanced BSC eBSC and enhanced PCF ePCF E. The eBSC ePCF E can connect to one of the MMEs D or D within the EPS core network A over an S101 interface and to an HRPD serving gateway HSGW E over A10 and or A11 interfaces for interfacing with other entities in the EPS core network A e.g. the S GW D over an S103 interface the P GW D over an S2a interface the PCRF D over a Gxa interface a 3GPP AAA server not shown explicitly in over an STa interface etc. . The HSGW E is defined in 3GPP2 to provide the interworking between HRPD networks and EPS LTE networks. As will be appreciated the eHRPD RAN and the HSGW E are configured with interface functionality to EPC LTE networks that is not available in legacy HRPD networks.

Turning back to the eHRPD RAN in addition to interfacing with the EPS LTE network A the eHRPD RAN can also interface with legacy HRPD networks such as HRPD network B. As will be appreciated the HRPD network B is an example implementation of a legacy HRPD network such as the EV DO network from . For example the eBSC ePCF E can interface with an authentication authorization and accounting AAA server E via an A12 interface or to a PDSN FA E via an A10 or A11 interface. The PDSN FA E in turn connects to HA E through which the Internet can be accessed. In certain interfaces e.g. A A H H etc. are not described explicitly but are shown for completeness and would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art familiar with HRPD or eHRPD.

Referring to it will be appreciated that LTE core networks e.g. and HRPD core networks that interface with eHRPD RANs and HSGWs e.g. can support network initiated Quality of Service QoS e.g. by the P GW GGSN SGSN etc. in certain cases.

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like.

Accordingly one embodiment disclosed herein can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments disclosed herein and are merely to aid in describing aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein.

In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. PDSN SGSN GGSN S GW P GW MME HSS PCRF the application etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input . In an example the logic configured to receive local user input can include at least a user input device and associated hardware.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an embodiment that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the embodiments described below in more detail.

The various embodiments may be implemented on any of a variety of commercially available server devices such as server illustrated in . In an example the server may correspond to one example configuration of the application server described above. In the server includes a processor coupled to volatile memory and a large capacity nonvolatile memory such as a disk drive . The server may also include a floppy disc drive compact disc CD or DVD disc drive coupled to the processor . The server may also include network access ports coupled to the processor for establishing data connections with a network such as a local area network coupled to other broadcast system computers and servers or to the Internet. In context with it will be appreciated that the server of illustrates one example implementation of the communication device whereby the logic configured to transmit and or receive information corresponds to the network access points used by the server to communicate with the network the logic configured to process information corresponds to the processor and the logic configuration to store information corresponds to any combination of the volatile memory the disk drive and or the disc drive . The optional logic configured to present information and the optional logic configured to receive local user input are not shown explicitly in and may or may not be included therein. Thus helps to demonstrate that the communication device may be implemented as a server in addition to a UE implementation as in the UE A or the UE B as in .

Sessions that operate over networks such as 1 EV DO in UMTS based W CDMA in LTE in and eHRPD in can be supported on channels e.g. RABs flows etc. for which a guaranteed quality level is reserved which is referred to as Quality of Service QoS . For example establishing a given level of QoS on a particular channel may provide one or more of a minimum guaranteed bit rate GBR on that channel a maximum delay jitter latency bit error rate BER and so on. QoS resources can be reserved or set up for channels associated with real time or streaming communication sessions such as Voice over IP VoIP sessions group communication sessions e.g. PTT sessions etc. online games IP TV and so on to help ensure seamless end to end packet transfer for these sessions. In certain cases scheduled always on GBR service for high priority applications running on a UE or other suitable mobile device may be desirable to improve capacity e.g. on the UE and or the network that provides the always on service and further to improve resource network usage. For example real time communication often requires always on service to ensure bi directional IP communication. However some non real time or periodic services may not require always on service. For example always on service may not be required during off duty hours whereby providing the entire work force with always on service may degrade capacity network resource usage or other QoS requirements because network resources would be reserved to applications during times when such resources are not being used. Further always on service may not be ideal for capacity on the UE. For example if always on or GBR service is provided on demand only to improve capacity or resource constraints associated with one or more applications on the UE that do not necessarily require GBR data terminating on the UE e.g. data sent to the UE from an external device may suffer due to the always on service.

In general always on service is often achieved via application layer keep alives which tend to have various drawbacks and disadvantages. For example application layer keep alives generally require an application layer server to provide and maintain the always on service and a keep alive for each application that requires always on service which can waste or degrade network capacity and handset battery life. Accordingly the following description provides a solution that can provide always on service only during the period leading to when the high priority application needs the always on service may desired to limit always on service to time periods when it may be needed. For example in one embodiment the network providing the always on service may maintain a dedicated bearer for a fixed time period and provide the UE with an availability time for the dedicated bearer in addition to an IP address for the Packet Data Network Gateway P GW application server or other suitable network component that provides a termination point toward a packet data network PDN . In one embodiment the UE may maintain the state of the bearer availability time and send a keep alive message that resets the bearer state to the core packet network if any applications running thereon request a dedicated bearer for the always on service. The UE may provide an interface where all applications that are interested in the always on service and use a particular APN can register to utilize the always on service. The UE can thereby opportunistically schedule single keep alives for the bearers associated with all of the applications that have registered interested in the always on service and use the particular APN. Furthermore the UE may similarly send one keep alive message within the bearer availability period for all applications on the UE that request or otherwise require a bearer dedicated to always on service. Alternatively in one embodiment when the UE transitions to an RRC connected state for activity on EPS bearers associated with other APNs and the bearer availability period is near expiration or otherwise at or above a certain predetermined threshold the UE can opportunistically schedule the keep alive message to reset the bearer inactivity. This opportunistic scheduling of keep alives may reduce network signaling and frequent establishing of over the air resources e.g. as shown in and described in further detail below .

According to one embodiment illustrates an exemplary ICMP message that may be used for the keep alive message that the UE sends to the core packet network to reset the bearer state for all applications that request or otherwise require the bearer for always on service. In one embodiment the ICMP message shown in may include a twenty 20 byte IP header and an ICMP payload that includes eight 8 or more bytes. More particularly the IP header may include a one byte version or Internet Header Length IHL field a one byte service type field a two byte length field a two byte identification field a two byte flags and offset field a one byte Time To Live TTL field a one byte protocol field a two byte checksum a four byte source IP address field and a four byte destination address field . Furthermore the ICMP payload may include a one byte message type field having a value greater than forty two i.e. reserved fields in the ICMP standard a one byte code a two byte checksum and a four byte quench field . In addition the ICMP payload may optionally include one or more data bytes .

In one embodiment the information encoded in the IP header and ICMP payload associated with the ICMP message that the UE sends to the core packet network may generally instruct the appropriate component that receives the ICMP message on the core packet network to reset the bearer availability time without generating a reply message to the UE. As such the ICMP message may reduce network overhead because the network may not need to send keep alive traffic to the UE. Furthermore when a certain application that requested always on service no longer requires the always on service e.g. when the user is off the service has an away presence status etc. the application may send a message notifying the UE to disable keep alives associated therewith. Accordingly if all applications that had been receiving always on service notify the UE to disable keep alives or no applications running on the UE otherwise require always on service the UE may stop sending the keep alive messages to the network whereby the network may deactivate the bearer s dedicated to the UE if no keep alive messages are received before the bearer s availability time expires. In one embodiment if the network subsequently determines that the UE has to be reached for a non priority call or other non priority data terminating thereon the network may use a push notification or a dedicated bearer associated with a default Access Point Name APN to terminate the call or other data on the UE. Furthermore when one or more applications on the UE return to a high priority state that requires always on service the UE may initiate a request to activate the dedicated bearer and maintain the state associated with the bearer dedicated to always on service in a similar manner to that described above e.g. sending one keep alive message prior to the bearer availability time expiring to reset the availability time for all applications running on the UE that require always on service . Accordingly the ICMP message may provide a unified mechanism to achieve scheduled always on service wherein the ICMP message may have a low overhead because no echo replies are required while reducing battery consumption and improving network capacity because the UE only has to send one keep alive message within the bearer availability period for all applications on the UE that require always on service. Alternatively in one embodiment the UE may send a conventional ICMP packet a conventional IP packet or another suitable message to the core network to reset the data inactivity timers.

According to one embodiment illustrates an exemplary communication flow to deliver a bearer time to a UE in an EPS or LTE network which may have the same or a substantially configuration to the RAN and packet switched core network based on an EPS or LTE network as shown in and described in further detail above. In one embodiment the UE may use the delivered bearer time to set up a GBR EPS bearer that may be used to optimize always on wireless service for any suitable high priority GBR application referred to hereinafter as App . In general App can correspond to any suitable application that requires GBR QoS and always on service on an associated EPS media bearer to support its communication sessions e.g. PTT sessions VoIP sessions etc. and uses a dedicated Access Point Name APN or other suitable context configured to specifically identify App to external devices or other components of the EPS or LTE network such as eNB MME S GW P GW PCRF and or HSS . However it will be apparent that the above mentioned components of the EPS or LTE network that may use the dedicated context to identify App are exemplary only in that the communication flow may suitably involve communication among fewer more or different components of the EPS or LTE network to deliver the bearer time to the UE .

In one embodiment the communication flow shown in may generally correspond to an LTE attach and PDN connectivity procedure that the UE may initiate to make its presence known to the packet switched core network. More particularly at the LTE attach and PDN connectivity procedure shown in may initially include the UE establishing an RRC connection before sending an attach request. The UE may send a network attachment NAS message and a request for an EPS bearer to the eNB in order to request service with the EPC network. In one embodiment the information elements regarding the network attachment and the EPS bearer set up may include among other things an EPS Attach Type set to Initial Attach an NAS PDN connectivity request message which may be included in an ESM message a PDN Type set to IPv4 and certain NAS security related items. At the eNB selects an MME e.g. MME for the UE in response to receiving the attach request message from the UE and forwards the NAS message received from the UE to the MME over the S1 MME interface. At the MME may then query the HSS over the Sha interface to obtain information that may be used to authenticate the UE prior to processing the attach request wherein the HSS generates and sends Authentication and Key Agreement AKA Authentication Vector AV and Key Access Security Management Entity KASME information to the MME in response to the query from the MME .

In one embodiment at the MME may process and send authentication EPS security context and ciphering options to the UE based on the information sent from the HSS and the MME further completes a location update procedure with the HSS at in response to successfully completing the authentication and security procedures. Upon completing the location update procedure the MME selects an S GW e.g. S GW for PDN connectivity and uses the APN associated with the UE or a default APN to select a P GW e.g. P GW for providing connectivity to the PDN. At the MME then sends a Create Session request to the selected S GW which sends a Create Session request to the selected P GW at to initiate creating an IP session. Furthermore the selected S GW may initiate the GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP tunnels for control plane and user plane traffic. In one embodiment in response to receiving the Create Session request from the S GW the P GW performs an IP CAN session establishment procedure at assigns an IPv4 address to the UE and sends a Create Session response to the S GW at to complete the creation of the S5 GTP tunnel or bearer between the S GW and the P GW for traffic from the given UE . Furthermore in one embodiment the P GW may further send the S GW a time period during which the S5 GTP tunnel or bearer for the traffic from the UE will be held in an active state and an IP address of the P GW in the Protocol Configuration Option PCO information element in the bearer activation message. In response thereto the S GW sends a Create Session response to the MME at to complete the S5 GTP tunnel between the S GW and the MME for control plane signaling associated with the UE . Furthermore the S GW sends the MME information to create a user plane GTP tunnel between the MME and the eNB in addition to information received from the P GW including the time period during which the GTP tunnel will be held in the active state and the IP address of the P GW .

In one embodiment at the MME then uses the information received from the P GW via the S GW and sends an Initial Context Setup request message to the eNB wherein the Initial Context Setup request message sent from the MME to the eNB may encapsulate an Attach accept message an Activate Default EPS Bearer Context Request which may include the APN PDN address QoS or other information associated with the bearer the EPS bearer identity and the bearer availability time and a Tunnel Endpoint Identifier TEID of the S GW . In one embodiment the eNB may then configure the access stratum AS security context with the UE at trigger a UE capability transfer procedure at prior to establishing the Data Radio Bearer DRB corresponding to the default bearer and send an RRC Connection Reconfiguration message including the EPS radio bearer identity and bearer availability time to the UE together with the Attach Accept message at . At the UE may then send an RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the eNB to acknowledge the RRC Connection Reconfiguration message. At in response to receiving the RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message the eNB may send the Initial Context Setup Response message to the MME together with the TEID of the eNB B and information to complete the establishment of the user plane GTP tunnel between the eNB and S GW .

In one embodiment at the UE may further acknowledge the Attach Accept message and send an Uplink UL Direct Transfer message to the eNB wherein the UL Direct Transfer message may include the Attach Complete message with the EPS bearer Identity NAS sequence number and NAS MAC. In addition the Attach Complete message may further include an ESM message container information element which may have ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT encapsulated therein. In one embodiment at the eNB may then forward the Attach Complete message to the MME e.g. in a UL NAS Transport message or other suitable message and at the MME sends a Modify Bearer Request message including the EPS bearer identity address and TEID of the eNB and a Handover Indication to the S GW in response to receiving both the Initial Context Response message and the Attach Complete message from the eNB . In particular the Modify Bearer Request message sent to the S GW may create a downlink DL GTP tunnel and thereby establish the EPS bearer to provide always on service to App . For example in one embodiment the established EPS bearer may generally comprise the DRB between the UE and the eNB the S1 U bearer between the eNB and the S GW and the S5 bearer between the S GW and the P GW . The UE may then use the bearer availability time and ICMP keep alive messages in accordance with the mechanisms described above to manage always on service for App e.g. as illustrated in which illustrates an exemplary communication flow to optimize always on wireless service for App using network assistance and keep alives in accordance with the ICMP message shown in and the mechanisms associated therewith that are described in greater detail above .

According to one embodiment illustrates an exemplary communication flow to deliver a bearer time to a UE in a UMTS based W CDMA network which may have the same or a substantially configuration to the RAN and packet switched GPRS core network within a 3G UMTS based W CDMA system as shown in and described in further detail above. In one embodiment the UE may use the delivered bearer time to set up the GBR EPS bearer to optimize always on wireless service for App which may generally require GBR QoS on an associated EPS media bearer to support its communication sessions e.g. PTT sessions VoIP sessions etc. and use a dedicated Packet Data Protocol PDP context or other suitable context that may specifically identify App to external devices or other components of the UMTS based W CDMA network such as RNC SGSN and or GGSN . However it will be apparent that the above mentioned components of the UMTS based W CDMA network that may use the dedicated context to identify App are exemplary only in that the communication flow may suitably involve communication among fewer more or different components of the UMTS based W CDMA network to deliver the bearer time to the UE .

In one embodiment the communication flow shown in may generally correspond to an Activate PDP context procedure that the UE may initiate to make its presence known to the packet switched core network. More particularly at the Activate PDP context procedure shown in may initially include the UE sending an Activate PDP Context message to an Radio Network Controller e.g. RNC wherein parameters of the Activate PDP Context message may include a Transaction Identifier TI of the NAS signaling connection for the PDP context a Network Layer Service Access Point Identifier NSAPI used to identify a user plane connection for the PDP context QoS requirements e.g. a guaranteed uplink or downlink bit rate a maximum uplink or downlink bit rate etc. a PDP type e.g. IPv4 or IPv6 etc. and a dedicated Access Point Name APN associated with the application s on the UE that require always on service e.g. app APN . At in response to the RNC receiving the Activate PDP Context message from the UE the RNC forwards the Activate PDP Context message and the associated parameters received from the UE to a Serving General Packet Radio Service GPRS Support Node e.g. SGSN which generates a Create PDP Context Request message based on the received Activate PDP Context message. At the SGSN may send the Create PDP Context Request message to a Gateway GPRS Support Node e.g. GGSN wherein the Create PDP Context Request message sent to the GGSN may have the same or substantially similar parameters to the Activate PDP Context message sent from the RNC .

In one embodiment at the GGSN then processes the Create PDP Context Request message and sends a Create PDP Context Response message to the SGSN wherein the Create PDP Context Response message may include the TEID of the GGSN the PDP address of the GGSN e.g. x.x.x.x a Domain Name System DNS server IP address and a bearer availability time. In response to receiving the Create PDP Context Response message from the GGSN the SGSN may generate a Radio Access Bearer RAB Assignment Request message based on the information in the Create PDP Context Response message sent from the GGSN . For example in one embodiment the RAB Assignment Request message may include an identifier ID associated with the RAB the TEID of the GGSN and or the SGSN and the QoS reserved to the RAB. At the SGSN may send the RAB Assignment Request message to the RNC . At the RNC may then communicate with the UE using the information associated with the RAB Assignment Request message to set up the RAB between the UE and the RNC . In response to the RAB setup between the UE and the RNC successfully completing the RNC may send an RAB Assignment Response message to the SGSN at wherein the RAB Assignment Response message may acknowledge the RAB ID TEID and QoS specified in the Assignment Request message previously received from the SGSN .

At in response to receiving the RAB Assignment Response message from the RNC the SGSN may send an Activate PDP Context Accept message to the RNC wherein the Activate PDP Context Accept message may specify the TEID of the GGSN and or the SGSN the PDP address of the SGSN e.g. x.x.x.x the DNS server IP address and the time period during which the bearer for always on traffic from the UE will be held in an active state. At the RNC may forward the Activate PDP Context Accept message and the associated parameters to the UE which may then use the bearer availability time and ICMP keep alive messages in accordance with the mechanisms described above to manage always on service for App e.g. as illustrated in the communication flow shown in which may be used to optimize always on wireless service for App using network assistance and keep alives in accordance with the ICMP message shown in and the mechanisms associated therewith that are described in greater detail above .

According to one aspect of the disclosure illustrates an exemplary communication flow to optimize always on service for one or more applications using network assistance and keep alives. In particular at a UE B may initially attach to an LTE or EPS core network B and use a default Access Point Name APN to communicate with the LTE core network B. For example the default APN may generally include a network identifier that defines a Packet Data Network PDN to which the UE B has requested connectivity and an operator identifier that defines a Public Land Mobile Network PLMN where a Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN or PDN Gateway P GW that provides a point of interconnection with the defined PDN is located. At one or more applications running on the UE B referred to hereinafter as App A may require high priority service at some point in time and therefore request always on service from the UE B. At the UE B may exchange various signaling messages with the LTE core network B and an E UTRAN core network A to establish a bearer dedicated to the UE B for always on service. As such the signaling messages exchanged at may generally establish the bearer dedicated to the always on service and provide the UE B with state information associated with the bearer for the always on service e.g. a supplementary APN and a time period during which the bearer for the always on service will be held in an active state. For example in one embodiment the signaling messages that the UE B exchanges with the LTE core network B may be substantially similar to the signaling messages shown in and described in further detail above and the signaling messages that the UE B exchanges with the E UTRAN core network A may likewise be substantially similar to the signaling messages shown in and described in further detail above.

In one embodiment at the UE B may then communicate media or other data to and from App A over the bearer dedicated to the UE B for always on service using the supplementary APN and according to the required QoS for the high priority service associated with App A. Moreover at data that terminates at the UE B may be sent from an application server to the UE B over the supplementary APN that corresponds to the bearer dedicated to the UE B for always on service. Furthermore in response to learning the time period during which the bearer for the always on service will be held in an active state e.g. based on the signaling messages exchanged at the UE B may start a timer to maintain a state associated with the bearer availability for the always on service. In one embodiment at the UE B may transmit a keep alive message to the LTE core network B and or the E UTRAN core network A before the timer expires in order to reset the bearer state for each application App A that has registered to use the supplementary APN for always on service. For example in one embodiment the keep alive message may have a structure corresponding to the ICMP message shown in and described in further detail above or the keep alive message may alternatively comprise an ICMP ping message sent to the P GW located on the LTE core network B. Alternatively the UE B may transmit keep alives specific to each App A that has registered to use the supplementary APN for always on service. Furthermore if the UE B transitions to an RRC connected state for activity on EPS bearers other than the supplementary APN and the timer corresponding to the bearer availability period is near expiration or otherwise at or above a certain predetermined threshold the UE can opportunistically schedule the keep alive message at to reset the bearer inactivity wherein the opportunistic keep alive scheduling may reduce network signaling and frequent establishing of over the air resources.

In any case the keep alive message s transmitted at may cause the LTE core network B and the E UTRAN core network A to reset the time period during which the bearer will be held in the active state and thereby maintain the bearer in an always on state. At and the UE B may then exchange various signaling messages with the LTE core network B and an E UTRAN core network A and communicate media or other data to and from App A according to the required QoS using the supplementary APN in a substantially similar manner to that described above with respect to and . At some point in time App A may no longer require high priority service and therefore notify the UE B to disable always on service at . As such in response to determining that no applications running on the UE B require always on service the UE B may not initiate a keep alive and thereby allow the timer associated with the bearer for the always on service to expire whereby the LTE core network B and the E UTRAN core network A may deactivate the dedicated bearer and the default bearer at when the bearer availability time expires without receiving a keep alive message from the UE B. At this point the IP address associated with the supplementary APN may be lost such that data that terminates at the UE B cannot be sent to the UE B using the supplementary APN wherein the LTE core network B may therefore notify the application server that the bearers to the UE B have been deactivated and that the IP address associated with the supplementary APN has been lost. At the UE B may then continue to communicate with the LTE core network B and or the E UTRAN core network A over the default APN in a substantially similar manner to that described above with respect to the communication that occurs at . During this time at the application server may send non priority data that terminates at the UE B using the default APN Cloud to Device Messaging C2DM PUSH service or another suitable non priority mechanism. Alternatively the supplementary APN may be reactivated at and activity may be resumed over the supplementary APN in response to the application server receiving high priority data that terminates at the UE B in response to App A requesting priority service at or in response to the UE A otherwise transitioning to a high priority state.
