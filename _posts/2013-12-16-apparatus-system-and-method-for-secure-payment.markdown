Embodiments of the invention generally relate to apparatus systems and methods for identification in particular apparatus systems and methods for identifying an entity for computer and or network security secure authorization of a payment or for funds transfer and for selectively granting privileges and providing other services in response to such identifications. In addition embodiments of the invention relate generally to apparatus systems and methods for the communication of information between a mobile user device and a point of sale device to securely provide authorization for a financial transaction.

Millions of financial transactions are conducted daily using electronic systems. Many of these are conducted using traditional magnetic stripe readers while others are conducted using smart cards mobile phones or other handheld electronic devices. However these prior approaches all require that an account number bank account number credit card account number debit card account number etc. be provided to authorize the transaction. Because a thief with access to an account number poses a significant financial risk and risk of identity theft financial service providers go to great efforts to try to communicate the account numbers securely when conducting these transactions.

In addition electronic transactions often require that a user provide information that uniquely identifies the user to allow financial information or other personal information to be used in completing the transaction. This user identification is generally static information that is the information does not change over time for example user names and or passwords. In addition the user identification information uniquely identifies the user. As a result of the well documented risk posed by identity theft business entities spend enormous amounts of time effort and money to protect this static user identity information. The approaches implemented by business entities include using secure networks to transmit the user identity information and alternatively or in combination with the preceding using various forms of encryption to protect the user identity information from electronic eavesdroppers. Regardless each of these prior approach results in the transmission of the highly sensitive user identity information.

Further traditional approaches to identity authentication rely on a verification process. That is the authenticator receives static user identity information along with other information such as a time or event varying code. The authenticator employs the user identity information to establish the user that the entity purports to be. The authenticator then employs the other information to determine whether that information authenticates that the entity is who they purport to be. Such approaches can include multi factor authentication in which the entity provides the authenticator with information including evidence of one or more of something the user is for example a biometric something the user knows for example a PIN or something the user possesses for example a token . In this example static information for example a user name or password is used to verify the identity of the user to locate the other information for example any of biometric data the user s PIN and or a seed associated with the token concerning the user which is stored by the authenticator. With a proprietary algorithm and the current time the authenticator generates a non predictable code using the other information that is associated with the user. The authenticator then determines whether the time varying code received from the user is the same as that generated by the authenticator.

That is some existing token technologies use a verification process that requires the user to supply a remote authentication system with a unique static index such as a user name or email address. This static information is used to retrieve the user s file including a secret seed. With a proprietary algorithm and current time that seed generates the expected unpredictable code. If the user sends the same code the possession of the token is VERIFIED. With today s powerful computers it is possible to electronically eavesdrop or otherwise obtain a series of a particular user s codes at different times and then reverse engineer the algorithm and unique seed to counterfeit a token.

As mentioned above however the preceding approaches must begin with the entity providing the authenticator with the user identity of the user that the entity purports to be. The security of these approaches can be breached because each requires the communication of the static identifying information. For example today s powerful computers can be used by an electronic eavesdropper to reverse engineer the algorithm and the seed based on a series of intercepted time varying codes generated for a particular user. Such an attack would then allow the eavesdropper to counterfeit the user s token.

Because of the previously described shortcomings of current approaches improved identity authentication is needed to provide sufficient security in view of the processing power of today s computers and the sophistication of today s eavesdroppers.

According to some embodiments apparatus systems and methods employ tokens that never send or transmit any abusable or exploitable static information. For example in one embodiment an unpredictable number representing the satisfaction of all three identity factors is transmitted by radio frequency RF to a remote secure server. In the background the remote server has been generating all non predictable codes that are being generated on all or a group of authorized tokens. If the transmitted code is matched against the constantly changing database included in the remote server the user is IDENTIFIED. 

According to various embodiments identity authentication is achieved without transmitting any exploitable static information. In one aspect a system includes a processor configured to generate a non predictable code using multiple authentication factors for a user in possession of a token. The system includes a secure authentication system for example including a database and associated server that stores multiple authentication factors for a plurality of users respectively. In one embodiment the secure system periodically for example every minute generates the non predictable code associated with each of the plurality of users. When a non predictable code alone without any static index is transmitted from a user token and received at the secure system the system operates to compare the received code to all non predictable codes valid at that time. When a match is found the user is identified. This approach is in contrast to prior approaches in which the user s identity is verified. 

According to various embodiments the token includes a mobile phone a tablet or iPAD device or other wireless user device and the token wirelessly transmits the non predictable code.

Additional features can be included in combination with the preceding. For example in some embodiments a PIN is not stored in the token. Instead according to this embodiment the PIN is entered by the user and immediately integrated in an algorithm such that it is not stored transmitted or otherwise exposed. According to one embodiment the algorithm includes an exclusive or operation performed on the PIN. Further the non predictable code is generated without being exposed to the user and is transmitted from the token via radio frequency RF so that it remains unknown to the user. These approaches increase security speed and convenience.

For example according to some embodiments the generation and transmission of the non predictable code in the preceding approach avoids constraints on the size of data that is transmitted from the token because the transmitted value is not manually entered by the user. In addition the potentially large size of the non predictable value for example 20 digits or more can exponentially increase security while RF transmission dramatically increases speed and convenience.

According to some embodiments the non predictable value provides evidence of three factors including something the user is for example the biometric something the user knows for example the PIN and something the user possesses for example the token with the associated secret seed . Thus in one embodiment successful authentication of identity is only achieved where each of the three factors is valid for generation of a non predictable value corresponding to the user.

The robustness of the system can be enhanced in some embodiments by addressing the unlikely circumstance where the same non predictable code is generated for more than one user for a given time period. According to one embodiment when the preceding occurs the secure system delays the authentication until the occurrence of immediately subsequent non predictable code from the next time period to insure that the authentication proceeds based on a unique identification. In some embodiments the current code and several future codes may be generated at either or both USR and the token for computational efficiency and instant comparisons. According to one embodiment the codes are generated at USR on a substantially real time basis.

To reduce the risk of a man in the middle attack embodiments can operate to have the secure system confirm its identity to the token. In one embodiment the token generates and transmits a first non predictable code or portion thereof to the secure system. This first non predictable code is not used to execute the authentication used to approve the requested action. Instead according to this embodiment the secure system identifies the user based on the first non predictable code for example using a code matching algorithm as described herein and replies by generating a second non predictable code or portion thereof that corresponds to the code that would be generated by the token during the immediately subsequent time period. The token receives the second non predictable code and determines whether it is correct by comparing the code to that which it generates. If so the remote secure system has proven its identity and the token then generates a third non predictable value that is transmitted to the secure system where it is employed to authenticate the identity of the user.

According to some embodiments the systems and methods described herein provide approaches in which the user device for example smart phone tablet or other form of token do not store information that can be exploited by a hacker to impersonate the user. In one embodiment the PIN entered by the user is not authenticated locally at the token. Instead the PIN is either immediately employed in the generation of a non predictable value used by a secure registry to authenticate an identity of the user or is transmitted in a protected manner to the secure registry as part of an authentication process for example by XORing the PIN with the non predictable value. Because the PIN is not authenticated locally the PIN need not be stored by the token. In one embodiment the user device does not store information that can be exploited by a hacker to impersonate the user.

Unlike prior approaches in which a non predictable value is encrypted either in a consistent manner or a varying manner embodiments described herein do not require encryption of the transmitted non predictable value because the non predictable value is transmitted without static identifying information. As a result an eavesdropper gains no knowledge of the identity of the user even where the eavesdropper intercepts the non predictable value.

In accordance with one aspect a system for authenticating identities of a plurality of users includes a network having at least a portion that includes a wireless network a computer coupled to the network a handheld device configured to communicate with the computer over the wireless network and a secure registry system including a communication interface coupled to the network. In some embodiments the handheld device includes a user interface programmed to receive user input including secret information known to the user of the handheld device. In addition the handheld device can include a processor coupled to the user interface where the processor is programmed to authenticate the user of the handheld device and generate a time varying non predictable value following a successful authentication of the user by the processor based on the user successfully providing the secret information to the handheld device. Further the handheld can include a wireless transceiver coupled to the processor and configured to transmit via the network a wireless signal including the time varying non predictable value. According to further embodiments the secure register system includes a communication interface coupled to the network where the secure registry system is configured to receive the time varying non predictable value and successfully authenticate the user where the time varying non predictable value is matched to the user by the secure registry system. Further in accordance with some embodiments a user of the handheld device is permitted to operate the computer to access resources with the computer so long as the computer periodically receives subsequent authentication information that results in a continued successful authentication of the user for time periods subsequent to a time at which the time varying non predictable value is generated.

In accordance with some embodiments the handheld device includes a biometric sensor coupled to the processor where the biometric sensor is programmed to receive a biometric input provided by the user and where the processor is programmed to authenticate the user of the handheld device and can generate a time varying non predictable value following a successful authentication of the user by the processor. In one embodiment the biometric sensor includes a microphone configured to receive a spoken input provided by the user and the user interface is programmed to display a multicharacter string including at least one of a plurality of alpha characters and a plurality of numeric characters and further where the processor is programmed to authenticate the user based on the spoken input of the multi character string by the user. In accordance with some embodiments the secure registry system is programmed to randomly generate the multicharacter string and communicate the multicharacter string by the network to the handheld device for display.

In accordance with another aspect a method of authenticating identity using a secure registry system is provided where the secure registry system includes a processor a communication interface coupled to the processor and database coupled to the processor where the database is configured to store seed for each of the plurality of user respectively and the processor is configured to generate time varying non predictable values using the respective seeds. In accordance with some embodiments the method includes receiving at the secure registry system a first time varying non predictable value generated by a first handheld device in possession of the user the first time varying non predictable value generated using a seed associated with the first handheld device and a first time. Further the method can include identifying by the secure registry the user based on the first time varying non predictable value and generating a second time varying non predictable value with the secure registry. In one embodiment the second time varying non predictable value is generated using the seed associated with the first handheld device and a second time where the second time is subsequent to the first time.

In addition in accordance with some embodiments the method may also include communicating at least a portion of the second time varying non predictable value to the first handheld device. In these embodiments the second time varying non predictable value is employed by the first handheld device to communicate the identity of the secure registry system by confirming that the second time varying non predictable value is valid when generated using the seed at the second time. Further the method may include authenticating an identity of the user by the secure registry system using the third time varying non predictable value generated by the first handheld device and received by the secure registry system. In accordance with these embodiments the third time varying non predictable value is generated using the seed associated with the first handheld device and a third time subsequent to the second time.

In some embodiments a method of securing a computing device can include receiving at the computing device a first wireless signal including first authentication information wirelessly transmitted from a mobile device proximate to the computing device processing the first authentication information to initially authenticate a user in possession of the mobile device the user attempting to access resources with a computing device. The method can also include temporarily allowing the user to employ the computing device to access the resources when the initial authentication is successful and continuing to allow the user to employ the computing device to access the resources upon a continued receipt of authentication information from a mobile device that is successfully authenticated. Still further the method can include automatically terminating use of the computing device by the user based on at least one of authentication information no longer being received from the mobile device and authentication information received from mobile device no longer being successfully authenticated.

In some embodiments an information system is formed as a computer program running on a computer or group of computers configured to provide a universal secure registry USR system. The computer in this instance may be configured to run autonomously without the intervention of a human operator or may require intervention or approval for all a selected subset or particular classes of transactions. The invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments and may take on many different forms depending on the particular requirements of the information system the type of information being exchanged and the type of computer equipment employed. An information system according to this invention may optionally but need not necessarily perform functions additional to those described herein and the invention is not limited to a computer system performing solely the described functions.

In the embodiment shown in a computer system for implementing a USR system according to the invention includes at least one main unit connected to a wide area network such as the Internet via a communications port .

According to some embodiments cloud computing is employed such that access to the USR and associated features and elements is remotely available to users and or administrators.

The computer system may be a general purpose computer system which is programmable using a computer programming language such as C C Java or other language such as a scripting language or even assembly language. The computer system may also be specially programmed special purpose hardware an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or a hybrid system including both special purpose components and programmed general purpose components.

In a general purpose computer system the processor is typically a commercially available microprocessor such as Pentium series processor available from Intel or other similar commercially available device. Such a microprocessor executes a program called an operating system such as UNIX Linux Windows NT Windows 95 98 or 2000 or any other commercially available operating system which controls the execution of other computer programs and provides scheduling debugging input output control accounting compilation storage assignment data management memory management communication control and related services and many other functions. The processor and operating system defines a computer platform for which application programs in high level programming languages are written.

The database may be any kind of database including a relational database object oriented database unstructured database or other database. Example relational databases include Oracle 81 from Oracle Corporation of Redwood City Calif. Informix Dynamic Server from Informix Software Inc. of Menlo Park Calif. DB2 from International Business Machines of Armonk N.Y. and Access from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. An example object oriented database is ObjectStore from Object Design of Burlington Mass. An example of an unstructured database is Notes from the Lotus Corporation of Cambridge Mass. A database also may be constructed using a flat file system for example by using files with character delimited fields such as in early versions of dBASE now known as Visual dBASE from Inprise Corp. of Scotts Valley Calif. formerly Borland International Corp.

The main unit may optionally include or be connected to an user interface containing for example one or more input and output devices to enable an operator to interface with the USR system . Illustrative input devices include a keyboard keypad track ball mouse pen and tablet communication device and data input devices such as voice and other audio and video capture devices. Illustrative output devices include cathode ray tube CRT displays liquid crystal displays LCD and other video output devices printers communication devices such as modems storage devices such as a disk or tape and audio or video output devices. Optionally the user interface may be omitted in which case the operator may communicate with the USR system in a networked fashion via the communication port . It should be understood that the invention is not limited to any particular manner of interfacing an operator with the USR system.

It also should be understood that the invention is not limited to a particular computer platform particular processor or particular high level programming language. Additionally the computer system may be a multiprocessor computer system or may include multiple computers connected over a computer network. It further should be understood that each module or step shown in the accompanying figures and the substeps or subparts shown in the remaining figures may correspond to separate modules of a computer program or may be separate computer programs. Such modules may be operable on separate computers. The data produced by these components may be stored in a memory system or transmitted between computer systems.

Such a system may be implemented in software hardware or firmware or any combination thereof. The various elements of the information system disclosed herein either individually or in combination may be implemented as a computer program product such as USR software tangibly embodied in a machine readable storage device for execution by the computer processor . Various steps of the process may be performed by the computer processor executing the program tangibly embodied on a computer readable medium to perform functions by operating on input and generating output. Computer programming languages suitable for implementing such a system include procedural programming languages object oriented programming languages and combinations of the two.

As shown in the computer system may be connected to a plurality of interface centers over a wide area network . The wide area network may be formed from a plurality of dedicated connections between the interface centers and the computer system or may take place in whole or in part over a public network such as the Internet. Communication between the interface centers and the computer system may take place according to any protocol such as TCP IP ftp OFX or XML and may include any desired level of interaction between the interface centers and the computer system . To enhance security especially where communication takes place over a publicly accessible network such as the Internet communications facilitating or relating to transmission of data from to the USR database or the computer system may be encrypted using an encryption algorithm such as PGP DES or other conventional symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithm.

In one embodiment the USR system or USR database may be able to authenticate its identity to a user or other entity accessing the system by providing an appropriate code which may be displayed on the user s smart card mobile device such as a mobile phone ipad tablet laptop netbook or on a desktop computer as some examples. A comparison by the user or the code generator between the provided number and an expected number can validate to the user or other entity or a code generator included in the user device that communication is with the database and not an imposter. In another embodiment a challenge response protocol is employed to authenticate the identity of the USR system and or the user to the other.

The database shown in has a USR database containing entries related to persons 1 n. The data in the USR database may also be segregated according to data type to enable individual computer modules to handle discrete applications on discrete data types. Segregating the data in modules may make access to the database more robust by enabling portions of the data in the USR database to be accessible even when it is necessary to perform maintenance on a portion of the database. However storing the data in the USR database according to the scheme illustrated in may make it easier for a user of the database to make changes to multiple types of data simultaneously or in a single session. There are advantages and disadvantages to each data structure and the invention is not limited to a particular manner of organizing the data within the database data structures other than the two shown also being possible.

As shown in each entry in the database may contain multiple types of information. For example in the embodiment shown in the entry contains authentication information access information publicly available information address information credit card and other financial information medical information job application information and tax information . The invention is not limited to a USR containing entries with all of this information or only this particular information as any information on a person or other entity such as a company institution etc. may be stored in USR database .

If the database information is split between multiple databases each database will typically include at least the authentication and access information to enable the USR software to correlate an authentication attempt with a valid authentication and to enable the USR software to determine access privileges to the requested data. Alternatively databases may be linked to permit information not in a main USR database to be retrieved with successful authentication for all databases accessed being done at the USR system.

In the authentication information is information about the user of the database to whom the data pertains and is to be used by the USR software to validate that the person attempting to access the information is the person to whom the data pertains or is otherwise authorized to receive it. The authentication information may be any type of information that will reliably authenticate the identity of the individual. For example in some embodiments the information may include any of a secret known by the user e.g. a pin a phrase a password etc. a token possessed by the user that is difficult to counterfeit e.g. a secure discrete microchip and or a biometric information concerning a biometric for example a voiceprint a fingerprint DNA a retinal image a photograph etc.

The user s authentication information may be manually entered or scanned at the interface center. However a variety of types of communication may be employed to communicate the user s identifying information from the user device to the computer system. For example near field signal may be employed to communicate information between the user device and the computer system . According to one embodiment the user s authentication information is included in or entered via the user s cell phone where it is then communicated to the computer system . In one embodiment the cell phone is also configured to receive information from the computer system at the interface center .

In one embodiment the user of the database will carry a user device that allows for secure access to the USR database without requiring the user to transmit any personal information. In one embodiment to access the USR database the user device retrieves a secret seed associated with the device and or time varying value from memory and obtains from the user a secret personal identification code. The user device mathematically combines these three numbers using a predetermined algorithm to generate a one time non predictable code which is transmitted to the computer system . The computer system specifically USR software utilizes the received one time non predictable code to determine whether the user is authorized access the USR database and grants access to the USR database if the user is determined to be authorized. The authentication information in the database entry in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in contains information to enable the USR software to validate the user using such a card in this manner.

Alternative types of identification cards or tokens may likewise be used. For example other smart cards may be used which generate non predictable single use codes which may or may not be time varying or other access code generators may be used. An algorithm generating such non predictable codes may also be programmed onto a processor on user devices such as smart cards or other computing devices such as a cell phone pager ID badge wrist watch computer for example desktop laptop netbook tablet personal digital assistant key fob or other commonly available electronic device. For convenience the term electronic ID device will be used generically to refer to any type of electronic device that may be used to obtain access to the USR database.

Likewise various types of biometric information may be stored in the authentication area of the database entry to enable the identity of the user possessing the identifying device to be authenticated at the point of use. Examples of the type of biometric information that may be used in this situation includes a personal identification number PIN fingerprint voice print signature iris or facial scan or DNA analysis. If desired the verifying section of the database may contain a picture to be transmitted back to the person seeking to validate the device to ensure the person using the device is the correct person. Optionally the identifying device itself may also be provided with a picture of the person authorized to use the card to provide a facial confirmation of the person s right to use the card.

Further a challenge response protocol may be employed in combination with or as an alternative to the preceding to validate the person attempting to access the information. Various embodiments may employ a challenge response protocol with or without an identification card.

In the Access information is provided to enable different levels of security to attach to different types of information stored in the entry in the USR database . For example the person may desire that their address information be made available only to certain classes of people for example colleagues friends family Federal Express U.P.S. and the U.S. mail service. The names or universal identifiers for those selected individuals companies organizations and or agencies may be entered into appropriate fields in the Access information to specify to the USR software those individuals to whom the address information may be released. Likewise access fields may be specified for the other types of information. For example the individual may specify that only particular individuals and or companies have access to the credit card and other financial information medical information job application information and tax information . Additionally the individual may specify that no one have access to that information unless the individual participates in the transaction see .

As shown in the USR software contains algorithms for execution by the CPU that enables the CPU to perform the methods and functions of the USR software described herein. The USR software in this embodiment performs all functions associated with validating an electronic ID card. If desired a separate authentication software module may be provided to validate electronic ID devices outside of a firewall segregating the authentication information from other user information.

This algorithm comprising the USR software may be used to implement in one exemplary embodiment a USR system configured to enable selected information to be disseminated to selected individuals in a secure and dynamic fashion. This information may be used for numerous purposes several of which are set forth below and discussed in greater detail below.

For example the USR system may be used to identify the person enable the person to be contacted by telephone or mail anonymously enable the person to be contacted by telephone or by mail without revealing the person s telephone number or present location enable the person to purchase items over the Internet or in a store without revealing to the merchant any personal identification information or credit card information enable the person to complete a job application without completing a job application form enable the police to discern the person s identity and any outstanding warrants on the individual and numerous other uses. The invention is not limited to these several enumerated uses but rather extends to any use of the USR database.

At act an application for example a software application is communicated from the USR to the user s mobile device when the registration is complete. The application can include any of a variety of software programs configured to operate on the user s mobile device for example applications programmed for or using any of the Java Platform Micro Edition ME the Android platform Linux .NET Compact Framework BREW Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless the Symbian platform the Qt framework Windows Mobile Palm OS as well as applications developed for proprietary operating systems such as Blackberry by Research In Motion of Waterloo Ontario Canada and iOS by Apple Inc. of Cupertino Calif.

At act a digital seed which may be encrypted is communicated from the USR to the user s mobile device. In general the seed is employed to generate a random number for example a time varying random number that can be used to identify the user. In some embodiments the seed is combined with an electronic serial number ESN of the token and a digital representation of the time interval. Thus in accordance with some embodiments the seed itself is generated in a random fashion at the USR and then stored such that it is associated with the user and can later be used to derive random or pseudo random one time codes that are generated at the user device and also at the USR as is explained further herein.

In accordance with some embodiments the seed is generated in a random relatively non deterministic fashion by the USR using one or a combination of the following non limiting examples a real time clock a counter included in the USR that measures an unstable property of an element for example the settling time of an unstable phased locked loop circuit or the characteristics of a random external event an analog signal for example a voltage produced by noise or data which is generated by or received by the USR a random number generator or cryptofunction included in the USR for example a multi stage random number generator an xorshift random number generator a linear congruential generator algorithm the elapsed time of an external function for example a wireless message transfer time or a random number generator provided by an application programming interface API included in the USR.

Communication of the seed can be completed over any of a wide area network or a local area network or a combination of both wide area networks and local area networks. For example the seed can be communicated through a cellular network to a mobile device such as a smart phone. In accordance with other embodiments the seed can be communicated to the mobile device via a wide area network such as the Internet to a user s personal computer from which it can be communicated to the mobile device via a hardwire USB connection or any manner of wireless connections such as Bluetooth communication. According to one embodiment the seed is communicated to the mobile device along with the application. In addition the seed can thereafter be updated as described below.

In accordance with some embodiments for example where USR is employed in a system for proximity based computer security using a wireless user device for example as described in association with the computer can have a USR element that includes a seed associated with each user authorized to unlock the computer to access resources. In these embodiments updates to the seed or seeds included in the USR element at the computers can be updated as described above to maintain current information in the computer for the user s .

At act the user requests authorization from the USR for any of a secure payment authorization for other types of financial transactions authorization for access to a secure network or physical space or authorization for any of the activities described previously for which the USR can be employed to authorize the user s action to a third party. That is once the mobile device is provided with the application and the seed is communicated to the mobile device the user has the elements in place with which they can employ the process as generally shown in to identify themselves in a secure manner to a USR. Accordingly in some embodiments the process ends at act for user registration and system activation. Thereafter the process later begins at act when the user requests authorization to take one or a plurality of the listed actions.

Beginning at act the process illustrates a general approach employing the USR to identify the user to authorize an action requested by the user either directly by the user or via an intermediary for example a third party conducting a transaction with the user. At act the user employs the mobile device to generate a one time code for example a one time non predictable pseudo random code. According to one embodiment the random code is generated by employing a combination of time and the seed that was previously assigned to the user and communicated to the mobile device. In some embodiments the ESN is employed with the preceding. As described further herein embodiments can allow the time to be substantially synchronized between the USR and the mobile device to provide a highly secure manner of identifying the user. Further the seed that is assigned by the USR is stored and maintained by the USR such that the USR has all the information required by which it can generate the random one time code that corresponds to the random one time code generated using the mobile device.

In accordance to some embodiments the USR maintains a database for a plurality of user s where the database includes a random seed that is unique to each user where the seeds are assigned by the USR server. As used herein the term unique indicates that there is no probability that the USR will assign an identical seed that is a seed having an identical value to more than one user for example pseudo random seed generation with the result compared to all previously generated seeds and rejected if there is a match.

According to various embodiments the random one time code is a discrete value that is generated by an algorithm that employs a combination of the seed assigned to the user via the USR and at least one of time for example Coordinated Universal Time an electronic serial number of the mobile device a SIM card number of the SIM card included in the device and a PIN number provided by the user. According to some embodiments any of the seed the electronic serial number the SIM card number and the PIN can be stored in a secure element provided with the mobile device. In various embodiments the secure element can include a microcontroller memory or other electronic components that can be provided in the mobile device. Further in various embodiments the random one time code is generated by employing a PIN in combination with any one of or any combination of an electronic serial number of the user device a SIM number of the user device and a seed associated with the device.

In accordance with one embodiment at act the USR employs a code matching algorithm to locate a match between the random one time code communicated from the mobile device and the random one time codes that are calculated for each of a plurality of registered users as provided by the USR. That is because the USR can host tens of millions or more registered users the USR is programmed to conduct code matching searches by first determining a current code associated with each user and then comparing the random one time code received from the user by the mobile device with all the codes calculated for that moment in time by the USR. At act the user is identified if a match is found. The USR then reviews the authorization request to determine whether the identified user has the permission required to take the requested action i.e. the USR determines whether the requested action is consistent with those associated with the user.

According to some embodiments registered users are organized into groups for example based on the geography to reduce the plurality of users that are processed with the code matching algorithm on receipt of a random one time code. In one embodiment location information can be transmitted with the random one time code from a user s mobile device.

According to some embodiments the approach illustrated in can be employed over periods of time for a variety of authorized activities requested by the user. Thus at act the mobile device and the USR are available for identification to support the user s subsequent activities as needed. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment the process begins again for a subsequent act at act however in some embodiments the process can begin at act . Where for example the same seed is to be employed in the subsequent authorization request made relatively close in time to the first request.

As also illustrated in according to some embodiments the process can be used to assist a user in making payments and or fund transfers from the user s account which is maintained with the USR. As is described in greater detail herein such an approach can provide the user with a means by which the mobile device can be employed to transfer funds between their account and the account of another authorized user after the parties have agreed to the transfer and after the USR has been employed to identify the parties to the transaction. In addition the USR can be employed to maintain the accounts such that the transfer of funds occurs within the USR from an account of a USR account of the payer to a USR account of the payee.

According to one embodiment the user can establish a fund s transfer account with the USR during the act of registration or sometime thereafter. In the illustrated embodiment the user establishes the funds transfer account at Act . Further the user can activate the account by transferring funds to the USR for example such as electronically transferring the funds wiring the funds charging the funds to an account or mailing a check to the USR administrators. Once populated with funds the account can be employed to make or receive payments or otherwise transfer funds between their accounts and the accounts of other authorized registered USR users.

In some embodiments authorized users that is payors or payees are established on temporary real time basis to conduct a one time transaction. In further embodiments registered USR users are authorized by a payor for an anticipated series of transactions over a longer period of time in the future.

Further one of the ongoing actions illustrated in includes the act at which automatic replenishment of funds can be applied to the user s account. Such an approach can rely on preauthorized transfers or debits from the user s existing bank accounts or other forms of electronic transfer funds such as a transfer of funds from a credit card or debit account. The acts and are illustrated in phantom because they are optional in accordance with some embodiments.

Referring now to a process is illustrated by which a user can employ a mobile device to receive an authorization for one or more of the user s activities. Some embodiments include a process by which a user activates a mobile device for use in having their identification confirmed. According to one embodiment the process includes act in which a user enters a PIN number in their mobile device and at Act the PIN number is communicated to the USR for example in an encrypted form. According to some embodiments at Act the USR compares the PIN to PINs associated with a plurality of users all stored at the USR and where the PIN matches the identity of a user communicates the multi character numeric value to the user s mobile device. According to this embodiment the user s spoken input of the numeric value is employed to authenticate the user to activate the mobile device for use in an identification process with the USR. Thus in accordance with one embodiment the user s spoken input is communicated to the USR for authentication in order to activate the mobile device. According to another embodiment at Act the authentication of the user s spoken input is accomplished at the mobile device. In other embodiments the mobile device can have limited functionality for example allowing a user to make phone calls or browse the Internet prior to device activation while preventing the mobile device from being employed to execute secure transactions or take other actions that require interaction with USR based authentication until a device activation process is complete for example acts and of the process .

In some embodiments entry of a PIN is not required. Instead a selection of the USR application results in the multi character value being presented to the user in a display of their mobile device. The user s spoken input of the multi character value is then authenticated at act .

According to various embodiments the device activation portion of the process the acts and can differ from that described above for example the PIN may be used to derive a non predictable value that is used to identify the user prior to communication of the multi character numeric value. In still further embodiments the process does not include the acts and .

Although the process is described a employing a multi character numeric value other embodiments can employ a multi character string that includes either or both alpha or numeric characters. In some embodiments the user interface of the mobile device for example the wireless user device is configured to display a multi character string including at least one of a plurality of alpha characters and a plurality of numeric characters where a processor included in the mobile device is programmed to authenticate the user based on the spoken input of the multi character string by the user. In a further embodiment the processor included in the mobile device is programmed to authenticate the spoken input on a character by character basis.

According to various embodiments the device activation portion of the process the acts and can be employed by a user to allow their identity to be confirmed and their actions authorized in any of a wide variety of environments and situations. For example at act the activated mobile device can be employed with the mobile device to make a financial payment or credit debit card payment or funds transfer using the USR. At act the mobile device can be activated to make a direct personal payment and or funds transfer between accounts within the USR including third party accounts. In accordance with a further embodiment at act the device can be activated to allow the user s identity to be determined and their actions authorized in a number of other situations for example to gain access to a secure computer network to perform other types of commercial transactions to proceed through security checkpoints access physical facilities etc.

Returning again to act and the use of the mobile device with USR based identification system the process can be employed at a point of sale. For example a user located in a store or other commercial environment at the point of sale. The transaction details are communicated from the point of sale to the mobile device for review by the user. Such transaction details can include information for example the purchase amount the name of the vendor time and date and even a list of the individual item or items that are being purchased. This provides the user with an opportunity to review and approve the transaction on their mobile device. At act the user can elect to accept the transaction by for example selecting an element in the user interface of the mobile device or cancel the transaction. Where for example the user elects to cancel the transaction the process ends at act . Alternatively should the user accept the transaction the process moves to act . At act the mobile device generates a random one time code as described for example in the embodiments of . At act the one time code is communicated to the USR along with the transactions details. In some embodiments the transaction details can include a code representing one of a plurality of accounts.

The communication with the USR can occur via the POS or independent of the POS depending on the embodiment. At act the USR receives the random one time code and employs the code matching search to identify the user. The user is identified when a match is found between the random one time code communicated to the USR and the USR calculated codes determined for the registered group or groups of users. This registered group or groups of users can be those other registered users who also employ the identification approach described herein. Alternatively the various group or groups can be divided into subgroups of users who may have some common association or identifying feature that USR can employ in organizing and segmenting the data in the database to increase the processing speed of the code matching algorithm. Regardless of the size of the group however the USR employs a code matching search and identifies the user when a match is found between a USR calculated code included among a plurality of codes calculated for the plurality of users respectively and the code generated with the mobile device.

At act the USR determines whether the identified user is authorized to complete the transaction for example does the identified user have a financial account with USR and if so are they credit worthy. At act the USR communicates a denial of a transaction if the identified user is not authorized to complete such a transaction. At act the USR communicates an authorization for example communicates the authorization to the point of sale along with a digital image of the user if the identified user is authorized to complete the transaction. The digital image may come directly from USR or partially from USR and partially from the mobile device.

According to some embodiments the random one time code generated at act is communicated along with static identifying information at act for example where a verification process is employed to authenticate the identity of the user of the mobile device. According to other embodiments static identifying information is not communicated to USR with the random one time code generated at act for example where an identification process is employed to authenticate the identity of the user of the mobile device.

In addition a device activation process for example the device activation provided in by acts can be employed without the remaining acts included in the process illustrated in . For example the acts can be employed independently in a process that may not include any communication with the USR and or may not include generation of a one time code using the mobile device.

Referring now to a functional block diagram of the USR is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment. According to some embodiments the USR is employed to identify a user from among a plurality of users based on the receipt of a random one time code from a remote system element. According to various embodiments the remote system element can include any of an electronic device such as a handheld electronic device a point of sale device a computer server or other network device for example wireless user devices and described herein. Accordingly in some embodiments the remote system element includes a mobile phone such as a smart phone. Further in some embodiments any of the elements illustrated in can be included in the USR systems or portions thereof illustrated in either alone or in any combination with other elements described herein.

In the embodiment illustrated in the USR includes a seed generation module a database of assigned seeds a generation module a time reference a comparison module a first communication module and a second communication module . Other arrangements and system configurations are possible depending upon the desired functionality. For example the embodiment illustrated in can be employed with the USR system configurations illustrated herein. Accordingly in some embodiments system elements that communicate with the USR to execute the processes illustrated in can include any of the mobile device the POS terminal the interface device the mobile device the network access device the wireless user device and the computer as some examples. In some embodiments one or more of the preceding system elements can communicate with the system via the second communication module . Further functionality other than that illustrated in can also be provided with the USR. In particular the USR illustrated in can include functionality such as any or select portions of the functionality described herein concerning other embodiments of the USR. Further any of the illustrated modules can be configured in hardware software or a combination of hardware and software depending upon the embodiment.

Accordingly it should be appreciated that embodiments can include other modules and or modules configured differently than those illustrated. For example the first communication module and the second communication module can be included in the same module the comparison module can include a database data table or data tree to store the current random one time codes for comparison or alternatively a separate database data table or data tree can be included to store the current random one time codes which are provided to the comparison module for comparison. In various embodiments each of the modules included in the USR is coupled to others of the modules.

According to one embodiment the seed generation module is in communication with at least the database module and the second communication module . The database module is in communication with at least with the generation module . Further in the illustrated embodiment the time reference is in communication with the generation module . In addition the generation module is in communication with the comparison module while the comparison module is also in communication with each of the first communication module and the second communication module .

In accordance with one embodiment the seed generation module operates to randomly generate for example without replacement and assign seeds for a plurality of users registered with the USR for example users 1 N. Further the generation module communicates the seeds and their assignments to the database module where the assigned seed associated with each user for a given time period are stored in association with one another such that they can be searched and retrieved. According to a further embodiment a separate assignment module is included in the USR and operates to receive the seeds from the seed generation module and assign the seeds to the plurality of users. In accordance with various embodiments the database module can include a relational database such as relational database such as Oracle Database by Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores Calif. Advantage Database Server or SQL Anywhere each by Sybase of Dublin Calif. MySQL by Sun Microsystems of Santa Clara Calif. DB2 by IBM Corp. of Armonk N.Y. or InterBase by Embarcadero Technologies of San Francisco Calif. In other embodiments the database module can include an object oriented database such as InterSystems CACHE by InterSystems Corp. of Cambridge Mass. JADE by Jade Software Corp. of Christchurch New Zealand or FastObjects by Versant Corp. of Redwood City Calif.

In accordance with some embodiments the second communication module communicates seeds to the system elements including user devices secured computers and other elements included in the USR system. In one embodiment seed updates are performed without requiring any user interaction. For example in one embodiment a seed in a user device or remote USR element for example the USR element illustrated in is updated in the background at a time when the device or registry element are in communication. In a further embodiment the update occurs without knowledge of the user. Thus the systems described herein can include automatic reseeding of remote end user devices and USR systems elements.

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment the generation module receives a time reference from the time reference module and receives the assigned seeds and users from which it generates random one time code at the time T for the users 1 N and communicates that information to the comparison module .

According to some embodiments the comparison module receives via communication module a random one time code from a remote system element such as mobile device POS device or the like and compares using a code matching search the received random one time code with those generated by the generation module to determine whether a match exists. Depending on the embodiment the communication of the random one time code can be over a network such as the networks and as illustrated and described herein. According to some embodiments the current codes of a plurality of users are organized in a table for example a table that is organized numerically. In one embodiment the table can be searched using a search algorithm such as a binary search. In a further embodiment the search begins by comparing the value that is sought to the middle item of the table. If the value matches the middle item the search is successful. If the value is less than the middle item then the higher half of the table is eliminated from the search. If the value is greater than the middle item then the lower half of the table is eliminated. The process is then repeated for example depending on the embodiment either iteratively or recursively within each remaining half of the table until a match is identified. According to various embodiments other search techniques may be used to search the table.

In other embodiments the current codes of the plurality of users are organized in a tree data structure. According to one embodiment the tree can be searched using a search algorithm such as a binary search tree. For example a tree can include a plurality of nodes connected in a hierarchical tree structure where each node to the left of a root node only contains a value less than the value that is contained in the root node and where each node to the right of the root node only contains a value greater than contained in the root node. Using a binary search tree the search begins by comparing the value that is sought to a value stored in the root node of the tree. If the value matches the search is successful. If the value is less than the value of the root node for example then the nodes of the left subtree are searched iteratively or recursively. If the value is greater than the value of the root node then the nodes of the right subtree are searched. This process is repeated descending the nodes of each subtree until a match is identified. According to various embodiments other search techniques may be used to search the tree data structure.

As should be appreciated the USR illustrated in can be employed in embodiments that use an identification process and embodiments that use a verification process. Where an identification process is used the random one time codes received by the first communication module are received without any static identifying information. The comparison module compares the received code with the current codes for a plurality of users to authenticate an identity of the user. Where a verification process is employed a static nominal constant is included with the random one time code for example appended to the random one time code as a suffix or prefix. Here the comparison module indexes the database by the static number to verify an identity of the user by determining whether the current random one time code is associated with the user who is identified by the static number. In some embodiments the random one time code is discrete and constantly changing with each change from one period of time to the next.

It should also be appreciated that the system illustrated in and described with reference to can be employed with any embodiment described herein in which the USR is employed to authenticate identity using either an identification process or a verification process based on receipt of a random or pseudo random one time code.

Referring now to a system includes a POS system and a mobile device . According to some embodiments the mobile device can include a wireless device for example a tablet computer netbook computer laptop computer a mobile phone a PDA a smart card electronic passport and the like.

In accordance with some embodiments the interface device is employed by an operator of the POS terminal of the POS system for example a cashier or service person. Further in some embodiments the POS terminal includes a cash register as is traditionally found in a retail establishment.

In accordance with various embodiments the credit debit card interface can include a magnetic stripe card reader or other means by which account information is traditionally provided by the credit debit card holder to the point of sale system. Thus in some embodiments the credit debit card interface can include a wireless interface that can for example communicate wirelessly with a smart card. However as indicated here these traditional credit debit card interfaces may not always be configured to allow a user of a mobile device to take advantage of the functionality and greater security provided by the USR for financial transactions even where the mobile device includes a smart card. Thus the interface device provides transitional hardware and software to allow the user of the mobile device to take advantage of the functionality and increased security provided by the USR. These advantages are also beneficial to the operator of the POS system because they provide a higher degree of security for financial transactions that are conducted using the POS system . The increased security can be provided as described herein by using the USR and the mobile device in an identification process rather than a verification process to authenticate the user of the mobile device and to confirm their credit worthiness.

In accordance with one embodiment the processor includes a memory while in accordance with other embodiments at least some of the memory is external to the processor. In accordance with some embodiments a microcontroller is included in the interface device where the microcontroller includes the processor and at least some of the memory .

In accordance with various embodiments the interface device includes any one or any combination of wireless communication protocols and associated hardware including any of Wi Fi communication near field communication NFC GSM or other cellular communication protocols and Bluetooth communication . In accordance with various embodiments one or more of these wireless communication protocols can be employed to communicate between the interface device and the mobile device as well to communicate between the interface device and the USR. In other embodiments alternate forms of wireless communication protocols and or hardware can be employed in the system . According to some embodiments a first wireless network included in the wireless interface is employed to communicate locally between the mobile device and the interface device while a second of the wireless networks is employed to communicate between the interface device and the USR. In further embodiments a wired communication network is connected to the communication interface .

In general the interface device operates to receive and display transaction information concerning the transaction being conducted between the user of the mobile device and the operator of the POS terminal by for example displaying transaction details authentication requests approvals and the like to either or both of the user of the mobile device and the operator of the POS system on the display . Thus in some embodiments the interface device receives the information that is generally provided to the credit debit card interface concerning the transaction such as the total transaction amount the cost of individual items being purchased account information concerning an account of the user of the mobile device merchant identification and current time and date. In some embodiments this information is received and displayed at the interface device and also at the credit debit card interface in the traditional manner however where the USR is employed the interface device can operate to take the place of the credit debit card interface . For example the interface device can receive the information necessary to authorize and complete the transaction from the mobile device . In one embodiment the electrical connection of the interface device to the POS terminal can be completed by connecting the interface device in series between the POS terminal and the credit debit card interface . According to this embodiment signals are transmitted from the POS terminal to the interface device and are then communicated to the credit debit card interface . According to another embodiment the interface device is connected in parallel with the credit debit card interface such that communication of data from the POS terminal occurs with the direct receipt of the information by each of the credit debit card interface and the interface device .

In operation and in accordance with one embodiment a user of the mobile device activates the mobile device for conducting a financial transaction such as a purchase of an item at a retail or other commercial establishment. In accordance with one embodiment the device is activated in the manner illustrated and described at acts to of . That is the user first enters a PIN in the mobile device and communicates it to the USR. Following a receipt of the PIN by the USR a multi character numeric value is communicated to the mobile device and the user s spoken input of the numeric value is employed to authenticate the user and activate the device for the transaction. In accordance with one embodiment the communication between the mobile device and the USR to activate the mobile device is conducted without employing the interface device . Thus in accordance with one embodiment the communication is over cellular network or other wide area network between the mobile device and the USR.

Once the mobile device is activated the communication link can be established between the mobile device and the POS system . In general in these embodiments a wireless communication link is established between the mobile device and the POS system via the interface device . The user or an operator of the POS terminal can employ a barcode reader or other conventional means to enter information that identifies the item or items being purchased into the POS system . The POS terminal receives the information concerning the selected item or items and processes it in a conventional manner to provide a total transaction amount.

In accordance with one embodiment a transaction summary is communicated to the user s mobile device for display review and approval. In some embodiments the transaction summary is communicated via the interface device where it may it also be displayed using the display . This provides the user with an opportunity to review and if agreed accept the transaction and request authorization from the USR to execute the transaction. In accordance with one embodiment the USR application provided on the mobile device allows the user to select an acceptance key or icon to indicate their agreement with the transaction see for example act in . In accordance with further embodiments the mobile device using the USR application operates to generate a random one time code and communicate the random one time code to the USR along with all or some of the transaction details. As is described with reference to the USR performs a code matching algorithm to identify the user by locating a match between the USR calculated code included among a plurality of codes calculated for a plurality of users respectively and the code generated by and communicated from the mobile . According to some embodiments the communication between the mobile device and the POS and the USR can be completed at this stage using the information provided from the POS system but without the need to communicate directly between the POS terminal and the USR. However successful completion of the code matching algorithm and check for the credit worthiness of the user of the mobile device results in the USR communicating an approval back to the merchant and or operator of the POS system . In a further embodiment an acknowledgement of the transaction approval is also provided to the mobile device from the USR. According to some embodiments the receipt of this information occurs at the interface device where it is displayed to the operator of the POS terminal . According to another embodiment the communication from the USR of the acceptance or denial of the transaction is communicated to one of the conventional elements included in the POS system for example the POS terminal .

In some embodiments the mobile device communicates the random one time code to the POS system . According to these embodiments the POS system combines the code with information concerning any or all of the selected products and prices and a merchant account code. The combined information is communicated from the POS system to the USR. Here too a successful completion of the code matching algorithm and check for the credit worthiness of the user of the mobile device results in the USR communicating an approval back to the merchant and or operator of the POS system .

According to further embodiments the USR can be employed to provide apparatus systems and methods to conduct financial transactions between parties directly securely and with greater convenience than current approaches. Further in various embodiments these approaches provide increased security relative to known approaches by eliminating the necessity to communicate any of or at least any one of account numbers user names PIN numbers or passwords. In addition some embodiments are employed in mobile devices that allow flexibility in where and how these approaches are employed. For example in various embodiments the secure financial transactions can be conducted with a user s mobile device at vending machines parking meters and at a variety of other locations. Further the approaches described herein can be employed even in situations in which the parties to the transaction for example two users employing mobile devices are not in communication with the USR at the time of the transaction and or not in close proximity to one another.

According to one embodiment two users each registered with the USR and each having a funds transfer account in close proximity to one another intend to conduct a transaction that will result in a transfer funds between their accounts. Each user independently activates their respective mobile device for example using the approach illustrated and described concerning acts of . According to some embodiments the device activation includes multifactor authentication in which a biometric is employed. Further in some embodiments the current seed provided from the USR is used in combination with the biometric to activate the device. In some embodiments the activation of the two mobile devices can include separate authentication protocols such that the user of a first mobile device is identified in a multi factor authentication process that does not employ a biometric and the user of a second mobile device is identified in a multi factor authentication process that does include a biometric.

According to a further embodiment the mobile devices can store default values which can be employed in a financial transaction. The default values can be used to allow a more rapid completion of the transaction by reducing the amount of data that must be entered by the user of the mobile device.

In some embodiments the two users select the Funds Transfer application via the user interface of the respective mobile devices for example by using a keypad a soft keypad a pushbutton style keypad etc. or an icon located in a graphical user interface displayed at the mobile device. Once the two users have opened the applications the payer user enters the amount of the transfer. According to some embodiments the payee user then presses a receive control element GUI icon pushbutton etc. which is available at the payee s mobile device via operation of the funds transfer application. According to some embodiments the payer user presses a send control element either alone or in combination with the payee user pressing the receive control element which is available on their mobile device via operation of the funds transfer application.

Communication is opened between the two mobile devices and data is exchanged. According to the embodiment a selected one of a variety of wireless communication protocols can be employed. These may include Bluetooth NFC or infrared or other optical or RF signals depending on the embodiment.

According to another embodiment the mobile devices each include an accelerometer shock switch or other shock sensor such that communication between the two devices can be initiated when the two users bring the two mobile devices into contact with one another. For example the two mobile devices can be bumped into one another directly or indirectly for example via contact between the users hands so that the transmitted shock vibration acts on each to open communication via the funds transfer application. In addition the preceding can be employed in combination with other user acts such as a selection of an icon in the display of the user s mobile device.

In some embodiments the two devices can remain in communication for completion of the funds transfer authorization via the USR. According to one approach the user payer employs the mobile device to generate and communicate to the USR a first random one time code that is employed by the USR to identify the payer. Further the user payee employs their mobile device to generate and communicate to the USR a second random code that is employed by the USR to identify the payee. The USR can separately employ a code matching algorithm as described herein to perform the identification of the parties to the transaction.

In general at least the payer includes the transaction amount in the communication with the USR while in a further embodiment each of the payer and the payee communicate the agreed upon transaction amount to the USR. According to this later embodiment the transaction amounts must agree for the transaction to proceed.

According to some further embodiments the USR separately authenticates itself to the two mobile devices employed in the transaction by generating a subsequent random one time code based on a seed associated with the respective mobile device and the current time. The one time random code generated by the USR for the user payer is communicated to the payer s mobile device and the one time random code generated by the USR for the user payee is communicated to the payee s mobile device. The two mobile devices each employ their respective seed with the time that the USR generated the random one time code to confirm the identity of the USR.

The USR can communicate subsequent to or along with the communication of the respective random codes a digital image of the payer to the payee and a digital image of the payee to the payer. Further for added security the USR can transmit multiple images for example a line up of images of a plurality of individuals to the two parties and the funds transfer is not finalized until the payer accurately selects the image of the payee and the payee accurately selects the image of the payer from among the respective plurality of images which are received. Security of such an approach can be increased by allowing each of the parties only one or some other limited number of selections in which to accurately identify the correct image.

The parties communicate via the respective mobile devices the confirmation of the visual identity of the other party to the USR which then operates to transfer for example electronically transfer the requested amount of funds from the payer s account to the payee s account.

According to some embodiments a funds transfer can also be completed between a payer and payee even where the two parties are not in proximity with one another. According to these embodiments the payer activates their mobile device and selects the funds transfer application. The payer then enters an identifier that identifies the payee such as the payee s mobile phone number the payee s email etc. along with the amount of the transfer. The payer communicates with the USR and transmits a one time random code that the USR employs to identify the user. The USR identifies itself to the payer by transmitting a subsequent random one time code based on the seed associated with the payer s mobile device and the current time. According to this embodiment the payer confirms the identity of the USR based on the received one time random code. In some embodiments the payee is identified by the USR and the payee confirms the identity of the USR in a similar manner. Here too the USR can communicate a digital image of the payee to the payer and an image of the payer to the payee for increased security. Provided that the preceding identity process is successfully completed in some embodiments the payer can then select the pay soft key provided by the funds transfer application.

According to another embodiment the USR and a mobile device of a registered user with a funds transfer account can be employed by the user to conduct transactions for example make purchases at a vending machine self service check out unmanned kiosk and the like. According to these embodiments the owner or proprietor of the unmanned system is also registered with the USR and has an account that includes the funds transfer option. According to this embodiment the payer opens the funds transfer application as previously described and communicates with the unmanned system to conduct a transaction. Information concerning the transaction such as the selected item the cost sales tax if any the identity of the parties and the like can be communicated. According to one embodiment the owner or proprietor is a corporation or other business entity. According to this embodiment the logo of the business entity is communicated to the mobile device for display to the user. The user can visually confirm that they are dealing with the correct business entity and then enter the amount of the transaction and accept the purchase by selecting the appropriate soft key generated by the funds transfer application.

According to some embodiments the funds transfer described in the preceding paragraph is completed using an authentication process with the USR on a substantially real time basis. For example the identity of the payer can be performed as described above prior to the payer receipt of the item. Where real time communication between the mobile device and the USR is unavailable for the transaction the actual funds transfer is completed at a later point in time as described below.

According to any of the preceding embodiments execution of financial transactions including purchases etc. approved and authorized by a payer and a payee can be deferred if the two parties are not in communication with the USR at the time the parties agree to the transaction. The completion of the transaction including the communication of the random one time codes successful identification of the USR and cross identification by the parties can be separately completed by the payer and the payee when they are next in communication with the USR. The USR can defer the transaction until each of the two parties completes the parts of the transaction for which they are responsible. According to some embodiments the communication between the users mobile devices and the USR is automatically established when such communication is next available.

Referring now to a process is illustrated by which users can employ their mobile devices for use in a personal payment transaction or other types of interactions during periods where the user devices are in communication with USR. The process generally includes the authentication of the users by their respective devices for example by their mobile devices. The process may in some embodiments also include communication between the two devices for example wireless communication between the two devices. However in other embodiments communication between the two devices is not employed. In some embodiments identities of each of the two users are authenticated by USR. In other embodiments USR authenticates an identity of only one of the two users for example the payor. Further in some embodiments USR authenticates itself to either or both of the devices via a handshake process as described below.

The approaches described herein generally employ multi factor authentication. According to some embodiments the approaches employ 3 factor security. As referred to herein 3 factor security employs each of something the user knows something the user has and something the user is and in addition employs one of the preceding three factors more than once. Such approaches are described in greater detail herein.

Referring to the process at Act user 1 is authenticated by their mobile device Device 1 . Similarly at Act user 2 is authenticated by their mobile device Device 2 . According to some embodiments the process includes Act in which Device 1 and Device 2 establish a communication protocol with one another. The communication protocol may allow the wireless exchange of identifying information for example public identifying information for each of user 1 and user 2. For example Device 1 can transmit a public ID of user 1 to Device 2 while Device 2 transmits a public ID of user 2 to Device 1. Act is identified as optional because according to some embodiments the process is completed without any direct communication between Device 1 and Device 2.

Although the current embodiment is described with reference to a financial transaction that involves user 1 and user 2 the approaches described herein may be employed by two or more parties to authorize and or agree to a variety of actions. According to these embodiments the user selects an identity of the other party ies the agreed upon act and if necessary any other details constraints or qualifiers. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art the party identification is in the form of something other than a payee or payor where the action does not involve a payment. Further regardless of the form of transaction the identification of the parties to the transaction can include the identification of an entity such as a company or other organization rather than an individual.

According to one embodiment at Act user 1 selects each of the payee and an amount of a financial transaction. Further user 1 can also select at Act an amount of the transaction and or an account type or other identifier suitable with the selected transaction.

According to this embodiment user 1 can select enter the payee identification using data stored in the mobile device or by manually entering the ID information in the device. According to one embodiment the identifying information of user 2 is located in the contact or address book in Device 1. Therefore depending on the embodiment the identifying information of user 2 can be provided by user 1 in the form of any of a name a shorthand identification an email address or phone number of user 2 which is selected from the contacts stored in Device 1. Alternatively where the process includes the Act the payee identification can be provided to user 1 by transmission from Device 2 to Device 1. Similarly at Act user 2 selects each of a payer user 1 and an amount of the financial transaction.

In some embodiments the information selected by user 1 is communicated to USR at Act for example wirelessly transmitted . In addition Device 1 can be employed to generate a non predictable value as described elsewhere herein that is used to authenticate the identity of user 1 at USR. In the illustrated embodiment the transmission of the non predictable value is included in Act . According to other embodiments the non predictable value is transmitted in a separate act that precedes Act . In addition Act can be preceded with a step or series of steps included in the process in which USR authenticates itself to the device. For example as illustrated in the process of .

At Act user 2 employs Device 2 to generate and communicate a transaction request authorization to USR in a similar manner to that described with reference to Act . Here too a non predictable value can be communicated from the user s device Device 2 to USR along with the payer ID and the dollar amount of the transaction. Further according to some embodiments Device 2 can be employed to generate a non predictable value as described elsewhere herein that is used to authenticate the identity of user 2 at USR. In addition Act can be preceded with a step or series of steps in which USR authenticates itself to the device. For example as illustrated in the process of .

At Act USR authenticates identities of user 1 and user 2 respectively. According to various embodiments Act can include one or more additional acts. For example provided that the authentication of user 1 is successful USR can also check the availability funds for the requested transaction.

At Act where the authentication of either or both of user 1 and user 2 is unsuccessful or the necessary funds are unavailable USR can communicate the fact to either or both of user 1 and user 2. According to some embodiments the process ends where at least one of the authentications is unsuccessful. In some embodiments following act the process can include a subsequent attempt to complete the transaction by either or both of user 1 and user 2.

According to further embodiments execution of the transaction can also require confirmation by the respective users of the identity of the others. For example as illustrated in at Act USR transmits an image of the payer user 1 to the payee user 2 and an image of the payee to the payer for local authentication of identity by the parties to the transaction. According to this embodiment an image of the payer user 1 appears on display of Device 2 and an image of the payee user 2 appears on a display included in Device 1.

According to this embodiment USR defers executing the transaction until the users accept the identity of one another based on the image see Act . For example where user 1 accepts the identity of the displayed image of user 2 and communicates acceptance to USR for example by selecting a key or icon included in the display of Device 1 and user 2 confirms the identity of user 1 in the same manner using Device 2. In accordance with some embodiments only one of the two parties to the transaction receives an image of the other. In accordance with still other embodiments neither party receives an image of the other for example the process does not include Act . Here too the process can terminate where USR does not receive either or both of the acceptances.

According to some embodiments the process does not include Act . Instead the mobile devices of the two users do not directly share any information with one another. According to this embodiment Device 1 communicates identification of the payee in the form of the identification selected from data included in the mobile device or manually entered by user 1. User 2 can employ the same approach using Device 2 to identify the payor.

Referring now to a process is illustrated where a transaction is initiated by two users in situations in which either or both of the associated devices is not in communication with USR. This is sometimes referred to as an out of band transaction. At Act Device 1 authenticates user 1 and at Act Device 2 authenticates user 2. Either of Act and Act can be accomplished as described elsewhere herein by local authentication of the user respectively for example by the user s mobile device .

At Act the devices open a communication protocol with one another to initiate the transaction by for example exchanging public ID information as described concerning Act illustrated in . According to other embodiments the process does not include a direct communication between the two devices and the mobile devices of the two users do not directly share any information with one another. Instead the public ID info is provided to the USR by the respective user as described with reference to the process .

At Act user 1 selects each of a payee and an amount of the desired financial transaction. Similarly at Act user 2 selects each of the payer and an amount of the financial transaction.

Although the current embodiment is described with reference to a financial transaction that involves user 1 and user 2 the approaches described herein may be employed by two or more parties to authorize and or agree to a variety of actions. According to these embodiments the user selects an identity of the other party ies the agreed upon act and if necessary any other details constraints or qualifiers. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art the party identification is in the form of something other than a payee or payor where the action does not involve a payment. Further regardless of the form of transaction the identification of the parties to the transaction can include the identification of an entity such as a company or other organization rather than an individual. As will also be apparent where the action permission to be agreed upon does not include a payment the respective parties can provide USR with a description concerning the requested action for example access to a particular physical space or secure electronic system during a specific time period and or for an agreed upon cumulative amount of time.

In the illustrated embodiment where Device 1 is not in communication with USR the authentication of user 1 and processing of the payment request is delayed until such time that Device 1 can communicate with USR. Similarly where Device 2 is not in communication with USR the authentication of the identity of user 2 and the processing of the payment is deferred until such time that Device 2 is in communication with the USR. Accordingly the transaction is not completed until each of Device 1 and Device 2 are in communication with USR subsequent to acts and such that remaining acts included in the process can be completed.

For example where Device 1 is not in communication with USR at the time user 1 requests the transaction then the non predictable value associated with user 1 is transmitted to USR along with a payee ID and the dollar amount of the transaction when Device 1 is next in communication with USR. Similarly at Act where Device 2 is not in communication with USR at the time user 2 requests the transaction then the non predictable value associated with user 2 is transmitted to USR along with the payer ID and the dollar amount when Device 2 is next in communication with USR. As described with reference to the process of either or both of the acts and can be preceded by an authentication of USR to the respective mobile devices for example as illustrated in acts to of the process in .

At Act USR authenticates the identity of the payer user 1 using the non predictable value received from Device 1 while at Act USR authenticates the identity of the payee user 2 using the non predictable value communicated from Device 2.

At Act where USR successfully authenticates the identities of both payer and payee the request is processed. Alternatively should authentication of at least one of the parties to the transaction fail USR will not complete the transaction but will instead notify the parties that the request cannot be processed at Act . Where the transaction is completed successfully USR transmits confirmation to the payee and payer at Act .

Referring now to a process is illustrated including multi factor security where the factors include each of something the user knows something the user has and something the user is. The use of one of the preceding factors more than once in an authentication process in the same or different form adds an additional level of security that provides 3 security. For example in some embodiments a first form of biometric is included in the original three factors that are authenticated for example voice recognition and a second form of biometric for example an image must also be authenticated to allow the action for example a financial transaction to proceed. According to some embodiments the respective factors may be authenticated by the same elements or different elements included in the process. For example one or more factor can be authenticated for device activation while the same or different factor s are authenticated by USR. In a further embodiment the same or different factors for the same user or entity are authenticated by a third party for example an operator of a POS or a party to a personal payment.

At Act a user s device authenticates the user based on a biometric input. The biometric input can be any of the variety of biometric inputs described herein including voice fingerprint handwriting retinal scan or any other form of biometric that can be sensed and processed by the device. Although illustrated as authentication using a biometric other forms of device based user authentication can be used in accordance with various embodiments.

At Act the user enters a PIN in the device. Further the PIN is employed along with the time and the seed which was previously provided to the device by USR to provide a non predictable value NPV 1. As will be recognized the non predictable value includes a time varying value where time is employed in the derivation of the NPV 1. At Act the process continues with all or a portion of NPV 1 being transmitted to USR for an initial identification of the user in possession of the device. According to one embodiment the non predictable values generated in the process are 20 digits or more. However the number of digits either generated or transmitted can be adjusted in advance to achieve a desired level of security.

For example Act can include a transmission of a complete 20 digit non predictable value. Alternatively only a portion of the 20 digit non predictable value can be transmitted from the device to USR for an initial identification that is only a subset of digits generated are submitted . In some embodiments a generation and or transmission of a non predictable value having a smaller size can increase the efficiency and speed at which the process is completed. Then at Act USR employs the transmitted non predictable value to determine an identity of the user associated with the device. In various embodiments one or more of the code matching approaches described herein can be employed at USR in Act .

Should the initial identification using NPV 1 fail the process can also include an Act in which the USR notifies the user that the identification failed. According to some embodiments the user may get an opportunity to provide another NPV 1 to USR to initially establish their identity.

At Act USR using the time and the seed associated with the device determines the next non predictable value in sequence that would be generated by the device. The USR generates this next in sequence non predictable value NPV 2 and transmits it to the user device. Here too can include a transmission of a complete 20 digit non predictable value. Alternatively transmission of the non predictable value can include all or only a portion of a 20 digit non predictable value again only a subset of digits generated are transmitted . Considerations here include the desired level of security the processing power included in the user s device and the associated amount of time required for the device to perform the comparison required to authenticate USR.

Should the validation of the USR fail the process can also include an Act in which the USR receives notification that the validation at the user device was unsuccessful. According to some embodiments the USR the same or a different NPV 2 subsequent to Act .

At Act the user device validates USR based on NPV 2. For example user device can employ the seed and the time of the time increment at which NPV 2 was generated to determine the value that is generated by an authentic USR. The user device compares NPV 2 to this value to determine whether the device is in communication with USR rather than an imposter to detect man in the middle attacks . Provided that USR is successfully authenticated by the device the process proceeds to Act .

At Act the user device generates NPV 3 using at least the time and the seed associated with the device and transmits NPV 3 to USR. In this instance the full 20 digit non predictable value is transmitted in its entirety to provide a high level of security. In addition as illustrated at Act NPV 3 can be combined with information identifying the recipient of funds involved in the transaction as well as an amount of the transaction before being transmitted. In one example NPV 3 is XORed with the information regarding the recipient of the funds and the amount. Further in some embodiments where lower security is acceptable act includes transmission of fewer than 20 digits to increase the speed of the process .

At Act USR authenticates the identity of the user based on the non predictable value transmitted from the user device NPV 3 . In addition USR can check for the availability of funds in the user s account.

Should the authentication fail the process can also include an Act in which the USR notifies the user that the authentication failed. According to some embodiments the user may get an opportunity to try a subsequent authentication attempt with USR at Act .

At Act USR processes the transaction provided that the identity of the user is properly authenticated and that the available funds are sufficient to cover the requested transaction. USR can notify a selected party or party to the transaction should the authentication and or financial check fail.

According to alternate embodiments the USR acts as an intermediary to banks credit card companies or other financial service entities. According to these embodiments the USR communicates the transaction details to the financial services company. The approval or denial of the transaction is then communicated to the user either directly from the financial services company or via USR depending on the embodiment.

In addition in some embodiments an image of the user can be transmitted to either the user s device to allow the user to display the image to another party to the transaction or directly to the device of the other party for display. According to these embodiments USR defers the processing described at Act until receipt of an acknowledgement by the party who has responsibility for review of the image authenticating the identity of the user.

In this or any other embodiment in which an image of a first party to a transaction request is displayed for review by a second party the selection of the image that authenticates the identity of the first party can be a pre requisite to the completion of the transaction. For example as described herein with reference to Act and of or Act of . Further where embodiments include such an act at a point of sale a clerk or other staff member can select the image from among a plurality of images that are displayed at the POS terminal for example the POS terminal or the interface device illustrated in . In one approach each of a plurality of customers has established wireless communication with the POS terminal or interface device and an image of each is displayed to the clerk. The clerk selects the image of the customer who is currently conducting the sales transaction. For example the clerk can select the image of the user with a touch screen included for the POS either a fixed location POS or a portable tablet type POS .

Further where the close proximity of multiple individuals parties requires a selection of a unique party to the transaction from among a plurality of possible parties a customer can enter a unique POS identifier to either initiate or complete a selected transaction. For example the user enter the number associated with a particular check out station line gas pump etc. According to some embodiments a proximity signal is employed to restrict transactions to only those wireless user devices that are located immediately adjacent to the POS or the wireless user device of the other party.

According to various embodiments the non predictable values employed in the process are random one time numbers for example pseudo random numbers. Further according to some embodiments the non predictable values used to identify the user to USR for example at act and to identify the USR to the user for example at act are a partial or subset of digits from a non predictable value generated for a previous time period for the user that were not employed for authentication. For example the NPV 1 and the NPV 2 are previously generated but unused random one time numbers or portions thereof. Further the preceding embodiments can be used where the USR is a cloud resource available to the user. According to some embodiments the USR receives a first portion of NPV 1 from the wireless user device where the first portion is employed by the USR to identify the wireless user device to the USR. Prior to authenticating the identity of the user but with a high degree of certainty that it is communicating with an authorized user device the USR transmits a second portion of the NPV 1 to the user device. Thus the second portion of NPV 1 is employed as NPV 2 in the process . Where the second portion matches the value expected generated as a portion of NPV 1 by the user device the user device has a high degree of certainty that user device is communicating with the USR rather than an imposter to complete the authentication process for example the authentication process beginning at .

According to some embodiments an untransmitted portion of a previously generated non predictable value may be employed as an exclusive or XOR checksum to insure the integrity and authenticity of the information being transmitted. Similarly previously generated but unused non predictable values can be used to encrypt for example using an exclusive or operation data communicated from either the user device or the USR.

Further in various embodiments the random one time code for example any of NPV 1 NPV 2 and NPV 3 is generated by employing a PIN in combination with any one of or any combination of an electronic serial number of the user device a SIM number of the user device and a seed associated with the device. According to one embodiment the PIN is stored in the user device while in an alternate embodiment the PIN is not stored in the user device.

Referring now to a system including a USR and a plurality of wireless user devices for example wireless tokens 1 N is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment. As used herein the term token refers to a device that represents at least one factor employed in authenticating an identity of a user or entity. As should be apparent in some embodiments a token can include a mobile user device such as a mobile phone where the token represents something the user has. For example the token can include a seed that must be employed to generate authentication information that can be successfully processed by the USR . In the illustrated embodiment the system can also include one or more network access devices depending upon the embodiment and a network . In general the system can be employed by a user in possession of a wireless token such as a smart phone tablet or other form of wireless electronic device. According to various embodiments the network provides users with access to the cloud where a variety of remote resources for example the USR can be accessed.

In the illustrated embodiment each of the wireless user devices include a biometric sensor a user interface a wireless transceiver a processor a display a memory and a power source . According to one embodiment the display is included in the user interface . In various embodiments the biometric sensor can detect at least one of a voiceprint a fingerprint a signature and a retinal scan. Further one or more communication busses can be included in the wireless user device to a communication of electronic signals within the user device such as the communication of data and or instructions. The processor can for example control communication within the user device . According to some embodiments the processor is included in a microcontroller.

In some embodiments the system includes all or some of the features and functionality described with reference to the system illustrated in . For example the wireless networks and wireless communication protocols employed for communication between the wireless user devices and or between the user devices and the network access device can include any of those identified with reference to the system . As another example the wireless device can include all or some of the features and functionality described with reference to the wireless user device of the system illustrated in . For example the wireless user device can include any of the seed the SIM and the ESN illustrated in . Further in some embodiments the USR includes all or some of the features and functionality of the USR of the illustrated in .

In various embodiments the system can also be employed as a peer to peer secure identification system. According to one embodiment biometric information for a pre defined affinity group for example U.S. air marshals FBI CIA Secret Service Homeland Security or TSA personnel airline employees members and or employees of Congress the White House the Pentagon Fortune 500 companies private organizations or the armed services is maintained by the system. The system allows members of the affinity group to challenge and or identify themselves to one another in a highly secure manner with a high degree of certainty that the authentication information that is presented is legitimate. According to some embodiments the wireless user device for example the wireless user device of a challenger is stationary rather than a mobile device.

In general authorized individuals register and establish their secure account at the USR see for example approaches described with reference to herein . In some embodiments their digital photograph or other biometric information is obtained and stored in the database included in the USR . Other members of the affinity group register similarly and an affinity group manager establishes the members of the group. In one embodiment the affinity group manager directly manages the membership on the USR server s . According to another embodiment the manager contacts the business entity that operates the USR and that organization implements the necessary change s in membership status. In some embodiments a different type of biometric is employed either alone or in combination with the image in an authentication process.

The stored biometrics and or images are used as described below to authenticate identity. According to these embodiment each of the user devices stores a first portion the A portion of the biometric respectively of all members of the affinity group with the possible exception of themselves . The user device stores a second portion a B portion of the biometric of the user associated with the user device .

In a further embodiment when two members of an affinity group meet they employ their respective user devices and stored biometric information to authenticate one another. In one embodiment a first user wirelessly transmits the B portion of their biometric to the user device of a second user. The user device of the second user receives the B portion for the first user and combines it with the previously stored A portion for the first user to provide the full biometric for the first user. The second user then reviews this full biometric of the first user to authenticate the first user. According to one embodiment the biometric includes an image where the A portion and the B portion are different portions of the image for example they may be different halves. The full biometric of the first user can be displayed in a display included in the user device of the second user. Similarly in some embodiments the second user also wirelessly transmits the B portion of their biometric to the user device of first user. The user device of first user receives the B portion for second user and combines it with the previously stored A portion for the second user to provide the full biometric for the second user. The first user then reviews this full biometric of the second user to authenticate the second user.

In some embodiments the biometric is split in half and the first portion and the second portion are halves. However the biometric need not be split in half. Accordingly in some embodiments the percentage of the biometric of other members of the affinity group stored on a user device can be either a higher or lower percentage of the full biometric. Regardless of the split the combination of the two biometrics need only provide a full biometric in combination with the corresponding portion.

According to some embodiments the biometric for example an image is divided in a manner that further increases the security of these approaches. For example an algorithm can be employed at each of the USR and the user devices to divide the stored images for a particular affinity group in a varying and irregular manner. According to one embodiment the division is latitudinally horizontally so that the first and second portions are upper and lower regions of the image respectively. According to another embodiment the division is occurs longitudinally vertically so that the first and second portions are left and right regions of the image respectively. Employing such an algorithm the two portions of the images provide the A and B portions respectively as a ratio of the percentage of the image included in portion A to the percentage of the image included in portion B varies.

In some embodiments the parties in an affinity group can using their wireless user devices challenge one another when they meet. In one embodiment a soft key is selected in a user interface of the mobile device . The selection of the identity application on the user device initiates a Bluetooth handshake in which authentication information is communicated from one device to another. In general the communication serves to establish to each user that the other user appears to be a registered member of the affinity group and following that authenticates their identity. In some embodiments a proprietary protocol is employed by the devices . In one embodiment such a protocol utilizes asymmetric encryption. A high resolution image of the challenged individual and relevant identifying information for example identifying who they purport to be is displayed on the user device of the challenger. The image is a full image including the A portion and the B portion of the image which are assembled by the wireless user device of the challenger.

An approach in which the user devices store the various portions of the biometrics is advantageous because the user devices need not be in communication with USR to perform an authentication. According to these embodiments access to the network or other network for communication with the USR is not required. Thus the authentication process can be completed in locations where external network access is unavailable such as for example underground locations black facilities in a plane at 30 000 feet of altitude on land sea or space. However in other embodiments the A halves are not stored on the user devices but are instead stored at USR . According to this embodiment USR communicates the A half of a user on request from a member of the affinity group.

Advantages of these approaches include the fact that the approach is rapid. Simple and convenient to use provides increased security relative to other approaches is incorporated in an existing item carried by the great majority of people does not draw attention to the participants when in use can be field upgradeable with affinity group additions and deletions in substantially real time where communication with the USR is available and cannot be used by a third party if lost or stolen.

Further embodiments can also provide any of control of secure access to classified computers and or networks provide secure access to physical facilities supplement or replace existing less secure personal ID approaches such as conventional ID badges ID documentation drivers licenses and passports replace credit cards toll payment devices activate deactivate security alarm systems at home or office and provide audit trails via for example the use of GPS integrated in the wireless user devices .

In addition the system can include the following features in the wireless user device a duress alarm whereby a user can employ the user device to signal the USR that they are under duress without detection by others for example where the user adds a known value 1 to the PIN at the time of entry and a self destruct mode in which either or both of hardware or software stored data of the user device is destroyed or rendered inoperable when tampering or abuse of the device is detected. In some embodiments self destruct can also be triggered based on a passage of time without receiving and or being able to communicate a reset signal based on targeted events or when a location of the user device is out of a pre defined geographic area. To further increase security the user device can cryptographically hash data files when not in use.

In some embodiments the user is challenged by other than an individual with another wireless user device . For example the preceding approaches can be applied to point of sale transactions or an access control point. Also although the above described approach describes use of an image as the shared biometric further approaches can employ any of a fingerprint a signature a voiceprint and DNA codes as the shared biometric.

According to some embodiments the system is employed as proximity based computer security system using the wireless user device to generate authentication information to allow a user in possession of the device to unlock the computer . According to some embodiments the wireless user device is employed to provide authentication information wirelessly to the computer when the wireless user device is in proximity of the computer for example where proximity is determined by a range of the wireless network. According to these embodiments the wireless network allows the wireless transceiver of the device to communicate with the wireless transceiver of the computer .

In various embodiments the wireless network over which the device and the computer can communicate can include any one of Wi Fi communication near field communication NFC and Bluetooth communication. For the preceding examples each type of wireless communication has limited range where Wi Fi communication has the greatest range NFC has the most limited range and Bluetooth has a range greater than NFC but less than Wi Fi. Thus for each of the preceding types of wireless communication the wireless user device and the computer can remain in wireless communication only so long as the device and the computer are in proximity of one another. In further embodiments other forms of wireless communication can be employed. Further where the inherent maximum communication distance is greater than desired security can be increased by modifying the wireless network hardware or software such that the range is further limited for example to a few feet.

According to one embodiment a user can unlock the computer to access computer resources by successfully authenticating their identity with the USR and then keeping their wireless user device proximate to the computer .

In accordance with some embodiments at least a portion of USR is included in the computer . In the illustrated embodiment the USR element is deployed in the computer . The USR element can take various forms depending upon the embodiment. According to one embodiment the USR element is a software module that performs local authentication of authentication information received from the wireless user device . In some embodiments the USR element includes a combination of hardware and software. Further where the USR element includes software the USR element can be electronically distributed to the computer for example via the network or via a different network.

In accordance with other embodiments the USR element only provides an interface between the computer and the USR . In accordance with this latter embodiment communication from the wireless user device is relayed or can be relayed to the USR via the computer using the USR element . In still other embodiments the computer can relay authentication information or other communication from the wireless user device over the network without need for the USR element .

In embodiments where USR elements can locally authenticate the user of the wireless user device the USR element can provide it in software such that element can be distributed for example securely distributed to a variety of computers that are remote from the USR . In accordance with one embodiment the USR element includes a seed for each user authorized to unlock the computer respectively. According to this embodiment the complete authentication of non predictable values provided by users can be accomplished locally by the computer . Thus in some embodiments authentication including bilateral authentication can be accomplished by the computer without any real time interaction by the computer with the USR . These authentication protocols can include all or some of the acts illustrated in where the protocols are employed to allow access to the computer for example rather than authorize a financial transaction . Further automatic seed updates for both the wireless user device and the computer can occur as described above with reference to . These seed updates can occur with or without knowledge and or interaction with the user for example they may occur randomly.

According to some embodiments the proximity based security provided with the wireless user device in combination with the USR is achieved where a USR element is not included in the computer .

The overall operation of the system allows the user to operate the computer to access resources using the computer so long as the computer periodically receives authentication information from the wireless user device where that authentication information is successfully authenticated by the USR system either at the USR at the USR element or employing each of the USR and the USR element . In some embodiments a portion of the authentication protocol is performed by each of the USR elements and the USR .

Various authentication information can be communicated from the wireless device to the USR to authenticate the user of the device depending on the embodiment. For example the information transmitted from the wireless user device to the computer can include a time varying non predicable value. Multi factor communication protocols described herein can be employed including protocols in which a time varying non predictable value is generated as a result of 2 3 or 3 factors.

In some embodiments the protocol includes the generation of an initial time varying non predictable value by the device . This value is wirelessly communicated to the computer for authentication with the USR. In one embodiment the USR element authenticates the user based on the value that is communicated from the device . Successful authentication allows the user of the device to unlock the computer to access local or remote resources. The resources can include any of files images forms e mail document management systems catalogs or other information whether located locally on the computer or accessible over a network such as the Internet or an intranet. Thereafter the device and the computer can periodically communicate where the device communicates subsequent time varying non predictable values to the computer for ongoing authentication. According to this embodiment the computer remains operable to the user for example unlocked so long as the computer continues to receive subsequent authentication values. In accordance with one embodiment the subsequent authentication values also include a time varying non predictable value.

In one embodiment the initial time varying non predictable value used to authenticate the user and unlock the computer includes only a portion of a larger time varying non predictable value. In this example subsequent time varying non predictable values can include additional portions of the same time varying non predictable value or a portion of or all of a newly generated time varying non predictable value. In alternate embodiments a complete time varying non predictable value for example a 20 character value with the full set of characters as generated is employed for the initial authentication and newly generated time varying non predictable values are employed for each of the subsequent authentications respectively to maintain the computer in an unlocked state. Depending upon the embodiment these subsequent authentications can employ a time varying non predictable value including a 20 character value with the full set of characters as generated or a time varying non predictable value that includes a subset of the full set of characters. According to some embodiments the time varying non predictable value only includes numeric characters and the subset is a subset of digits. According to other embodiments the time varying non predictable value includes both alpha and numeric characters for example a value represented in hexadecimal notation .

In one embodiment static identifying information is not included and the system employs an identification process as described elsewhere herein. In accordance with an alternate embodiment at least some form of static identifying information concerning the user is communicated with the non predictable value in a verification process that is employed either locally at the computer with the USR element or remotely at the USR to authenticate the user.

As mentioned above the system can maintain the computer in the unlocked state so long as time varying non predictable values are received subsequent to the initial authentication and provided that these later received values are successfully authenticated. Thus where the user moves with the wireless user device out of the proximity of the computer for example out of wireless range the computer can go into a locked state that will prevent its further use until an authentication protocol is successfully initiated by the same or a different user.

In some embodiments the system employs an initial user authentication process such as the process described in association with embodiments of for example a handshake or bilateral authentication must be completed at a start of the process to unlock the computer. However in one embodiment the computer can temporarily lock up for a permissible time period following the initial successful user authentication. Provided that the user returns within the permissible time period the computer will unlock provided that a subsequent time varying non predictable values is received and successfully authenticated without need for the user to repeat the initial user authentication process.

In this example the computer is unlocked with an initial authentication and remains in the unlocked state so long as the subsequent time varying non predictable values is received and successfully authenticated. Where a subsequent time varying non predictable value is received and not successfully authenticated the computer will return to a locked state that requires a user to complete the initial user authentication process to unlock the computer . However where the computer stops receiving subsequent time varying non predictable values for less than a predetermined period of time for example a matter of minutes when the user has momentarily left the immediate vicinity of the computer that user can return and unlock the computer with the successful authentication of subsequent time varying non predictable values generated with the wireless user device without beginning the authentication process anew.

The computer can be configured to authenticate one or more users to employ one or more wireless user devices . For example computer can be accessible to a plurality of users where each of the users employs a different wireless device respectively. According to these embodiments the computer can maintain or access via USR authentication information such as seeds for each of the plurality of authorized users. Further each of the plurality of wireless user devices generates time varying non predictable values independently of others of the plurality of wireless user devices.

Further activation of the wireless user device can employ approaches described herein using multiple factors including something the user knows something the user has something the user is alone or in combination with each other or with additional factors. Thus in accordance with one embodiment the wireless user device includes a seed that is used to generate a time varying non predictable value. In accordance with some embodiments the seed is provided by the USR in the manner described else where herein. In accordance with a further embodiment the electronic serial number of the wireless user device can also be employed as a seed either alone or in combination with the USR seed . Similarly the subscriber identity module can include information that is employed alone or in combination with the USR seed and or the electronic serial number as a seed that is used to generate a time varying non predictable value. As should be apparent the approach then employs the seed to generate the time varying non predictable value and also employs a temporal element such as the current time for example a time at which the code or the value is generated. According to some embodiments the processor of the wireless user device is configured to employ time secret information known to the user and a seed to generate the time varying non predictable value. In accordance with further embodiments the processor is configured to generate the non predicable value at least in part by combining the secret information and the seed and in an exclusive or operation. Either or both of the electronic serial number and the SIM number may be employed in any combination with the preceding to further increase security of the multi factor authentication process.

According to some embodiments the subsequent time varying non predictable values are generated for subsequent time periods respectively. The selection of the increment of time that provides the subsequent time periods can be selected based on the embodiment such that a new period of time occurs with a relatively high frequency in high security applications or at a lower frequency for lower security applications. Accordingly depending upon the embodiment the subsequent time varying non predictable value used in an authentication process can refer to a time varying non predictable value that is generated for a time period that is immediately subsequent to the preceding time period or a later occurring time period. For example the NPV 1 the NPV 2 and the NPV 3 can be generated for three consecutive time periods or in sequence for time periods that include one or more time periods for which a NPV is not generated and transmitted. The approach can vary depending upon a length established for the time periods and the time required for a transmission and or processing of the time varying non predictable value. In one embodiment the USR system operates to vary the length of the time periods to increase security.

The preceding embodiments can be employed to provide an uncounterfeitable token that may be used in processes that have increased security relative to prior approaches.

According to some embodiments an electronic wallet included in a mobile phone allows one to use any number of credit or debit cards at the point of sale where no private sensitive or secret information or account numbers are stored in the device or transmitted by near field communication NFC . In further embodiments the electronic wallet in addition to NFC can also communicate in Bluetooth and Wi Fi and can be used for interpersonal funds transfer computer network access access to physical facilities and to otherwise authenticate one s identity and act as an individual s trusted agent.

In some embodiments a user must satisfy 3 factor security to make a transaction for example by using a discreet token the mobile phone a secret the users PIN and a voice print a biometric . In these embodiments the biometric can not be recorded and replayed because the biometric required for authentication and or device activation is a new code that must be spoken digit by digit with each authentication. In embodiments where a digital picture of the identified user is sent to POS from USR the requirements of 3 factor Security are met.

Embodiments of the system and method described herein can employ identification technology to increase security because no static abusable or exploitable static identifier is used. The preceding feature distinguishes these embodiments from verification technology where some form of static identifier is required. Further where static identifying information is not employed the generated successful unpredictable code transmitted from the mobile user device represents satisfaction of all three security factors and identifies rather than verifies the identification of the user.

Further the various embodiments described herein can be employed in an identification process or a verification process depending on the specific embodiment. For example in one approach identification static identifying information that identifies the user is not included with the transmitted random one time code. Because an identification process provides increased security in this embodiment the USR employs a code matching algorithm to authenticate the user s identity without benefit of any static identifying information. In contrast in another approach for the embodiments described herein the USR employs the static identifying information in combination with a code matching algorithm to authenticate the user s identity.

In some embodiments no PIN is stored in the token. In some of these embodiments the PIN is integrated with the algorithm and never stored transmitted or exposed.

In the improbable circumstance where at a particular time period more than one unpredictable code is generated for more than one user at USR USR can in some embodiments wait for the next immediately subsequent in time code to authenticate based on a user s unique identity.

Further in some embodiments a token can first send a non transactional subset non predictable code to the USR server. The server then sends a subset of the next code that the USR token would generate to the token. Thus the server has demonstrated its authenticity to the token and then the token can send the actual active non predictable code to the now trusted authenticated secure USR server.

Still further in various embodiments some of the preceding can employ or be employed in apparatus systems and methods where a verification process in used. For example the non predictable value can be communicated along with static identifying information. Where even greater security is required an identification process can be employed. For example with the identification process the non predictable value can be communicated without any static identifying information.

According to any of the preceding embodiments the mobile devices each include a GPS. According to these embodiments the GPS capabilities can be used to track user activities and apply security criteria that can act to limit transaction activity based on the location of the mobile device and or the relative change in position of the mobile device.

According to each of the preceding embodiments in which a PIN is employed to generate a non predictable value communicated for authentication the PIN need not be stored in the wireless user device. According to these embodiments the PIN can be supplied by the user and immediately employed in an algorithm used to generate the non predictable value for example a time varying non predictable value .
