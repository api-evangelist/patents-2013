title: Non-persistent heterogeneous neighbors
abstract: A heterogeneous network comprising macro network devices and micro network devices operates to maintain a dynamic data set of neighbor relations for a potential transfer of a User Equipment (UE) device from one network zone to another network zone. In response to detecting a failure of a macro network device to establish a network connection with a network device, a dynamic management of the data set initiates. A capacity number of network connections is determined for the macro network device (e.g., macro eNB sector carrier) based on the data set of neighbor relations. A threshold number is determined from the network neighbor device data, representing the set of micro network devices with which the macro network device is operable to establish the network. A defined number of micro network devices is maintained that is less than the threshold number of the network neighbor device data.

The subject disclosure relates to wireless communications and in particular to heterogeneous network neighbors of wireless communication networks.

Conventional macro network platforms that provide service to mobile devices e.g. user equipment UE contend with mobility of the UE when providing communication services. Networks e.g. long term evolution LTE technologies utilize an automatic neighbor relations ANR feature to establish neighbor relations between nodes of the network e.g. eNodeBs based on measurement reports from UEs in the operator network. Traditional ANR mechanisms are designed for single layer networks where cells are of similar size e.g. macro network cells and importance for real time mobility. Multi layer heterogeneous networks including macro cell networks pico cell networks Femto cell networks Metro cell networks etc. do not fit this model. Large cells may be presented with additional infrequently used small cell neighbors to manage. If those small cell neighbor relations are persistent in nature the large cell neighbor lists are truncated or can become too large to broadcast in a timely fashion. This can prevent mobile stations from identifying sites that are potential handover candidates and adversely affect mobile handover performance.

Aspects of the subject disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings that illustrate different example embodiments. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. However the subject disclosure can embody many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein.

The management of small cell relationships or neighbor relations among multi heterogeneous networks can ensure less delay in identifying sites or network devices having network coverage areas that are potential handover candidates. Network data e.g. a network list data store network table network candidate data or the like can be utilized to store network neighbor relations or communication connections for handover potential among UEs. The network data can be dynamically updated resorted and managed based on various network dynamics with each macro network cell device the macro network neighbors and micro cell neighbors e.g. Femto cell network devices pico cell network devices metro cell network devices or other network devices facilitating a network coverage area for mobile communication . For example the network data can be a list or data store having potential handover candidates in which the data can be updated as network devices are added and deleted as potential handover candidates for the hand off from one network to another network neighboring or having neighbor relations with the first network device. As a macro cell for example approaches or reaches a maximum amount of neighbor relations neighbor connections some neighbor relations can get dropped from the permanent list or truncated to accommodate additional neighbors as potential hand over candidates. When these additional neighbors are not frequently used or have a low rate of attach attempts dropping the neighbor relations of other cells can be an inefficient use of resources and cause delay among other UE s for potential hand off.

In an aspect disclosed an aggressive addition of neighbors is created by UE discovery of candidates cell network listening schemes or other automated processes while avoiding the danger of creating permanent neighbor lists that are too long to be broadcast in an efficient manner or too long for a managing server or UE to efficiently scan. This method is particularly applicable to small cells Femto cells closed subscriber group CSG cells or other controlled access cells that have small or restricted access coverage areas relative to a macro network device and or areas where there is pedestrian or low mobility such that a very minor delay in hand in to the cell caused by extra signaling to set up the neighbor relation would not adversely affect customer perceived performance.

In one embodiment various methods allow for infrequently used ephemeral or restricted access cells that have had neighbor relations created via an automated process such as ANR to be deleted after a relatively short delay of fixed calculated or operator settable duration with minimal impact on performance and signaling load. This functionality can be deliberately applied to the non macro layers in order to reduce impact and work with legacy macro systems. LTE and Femto specific mechanisms are described for example but the intended application is not limited to LTE or Femto. The embodiments herein can be applied for example to many other network layers and technologies than LTE and Femto examples such as with any macro cell network devices and micro cell devices that comprise smaller coverage zones or coverage areas than the macro cell network devices. Macro LTE eNB evolved node Bs or macro cell devices that can comprise macro level network nodes or macro network cell devices can add and remove other LTE handover neighbors according to the 3GPP ANR. In addition the macro eNB macro network cell device does not differentiate heterogeneous network layers such as macro network devices and micro cell devices operating as neighbors in the same network environment for these neighbor additions and deletions. These operations can be addressed via specific ANR controls in the lower layer networks specifically in Femto cell network devices or other micro cell network devices or micro cell network managing devices. Pertinent functionality is implemented for potential hand off or handover from one network cell device to another in three stages 1 construct available neighbor history for macro network 2 operate neighbor neighbor candidates neighbor connections addition and 3 neighbor prioritization and cleanup.

The wireless communications environment includes one or more macro cell network devices that broadcast macro network zone coverage areas and one or more micro network devices e.g. Pico network access point Metro network access point Femto network access point or other similar micro network access points deployed within the wireless communications environment and servicing one or more UE devices in corresponding network coverage zones. Each wireless communications network e.g. macro access points and micro access points comprises one or more network devices e.g. a set of network devices such as base stations that operate in conjunction with one another in order to process network traffic e.g. handoff operations and coverage for the one or more UE devices or . The network devices e.g. can be neighbors within one another that overlap or have coverage boundaries alongside or proximate to one another. For example a number of FAPs or other micro network devices can overlap or have neighboring coverage with each macro network device respectively. The macro network devices can comprise a set of network devices that are cellular enabled network devices which could provide different network speeds e.g. 2G 3G 4G etc. . In another example the micro access point devices can include a set of network devices that extend network coverage or expand the network environment at the cell edge especially where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable and can include any standard such as for WCDMA GSM CDMA2000 TD SCDMA WiMAX for LTE or other solutions.

The communications environment can include one or more management servers that are communicatively coupled to the network devices such as the macro network devices and the micro network devices as a control node for one or more networks. The management servers can operatively control UE device tracking and paging procedures including retransmissions and handover hand off operations to ensure seamless mobility through various network zones within the network environment . The management servers can control for example the bearer activation deactivation process and choosing a serving gateway for the UE devices or at the initial attach and at the time of an intra network handover e.g. among the different networks 4G to 3G 3G to 3G or the like . Further the network devices e.g. macro network devices or micro network devices can include the management server respectively and thus these and other management operations can be controlled by each network device itself with the management servers internal or independently external to the network devices. The management servers can authenticate UEs by interacting with the other devices communicatively coupled thereto and or sets of data servers such as a home subscriber server and the like. The management servers can operate in conjunction with one or more backend packet core components having a processor and memory that can operate to generate and allocate temporary identities to UEs and terminates Non Access Stratum NAS signaling or other signaling protocol layers. The NAS can be used to manage the establishment of communication sessions e.g. between UEs and for maintaining continuous communications with the user equipment as the UE moves such as for hand over operations from network device to network device. The management servers can also manage signaling to the Access Stratum for carrying information over the wireless portion of the network and security key management operations e.g. authentication verification authorization operations with UE application data and UE device functions. In particular one or more of the managing servers can operate to maintain and establish network relations via one or more base stations or network devices via an X2 interface or as a mobility management entity MME via an S1 interface for example.

The communication environment can operate to implement techniques for a heterogeneous network environment in a SON network that provide automatic configuration of neighbor cell relations such as ANR for example. The managing servers can operate as network devices that can facilitate ANR operations to configure discovered neighbor relations such that handovers can be performed in combination with neighbor relation establishment without dropping a UE connection to the networks of the network environment . In one example the network environment can comprises a LTE environment that can comprise one or more evolved radio access networks E UTRAN with corresponding network devices or macro network devices with micro network devices overlapping and an evolved packet core such as the backend packet core . Each cell can be served by an eNodeB eNB base station or other macro network device in which handover can pass between the macro network devices and or the smaller micro network devices for example.

As illustrated each of the one or more micro access points can have a corresponding service area . In addition each of the one or more macro network devices can have a corresponding service or broadcast area . However the wireless communications environment is not limited to this implementation and various other architectures can also be employed. For example the self organizing network devices of the communication environment can deploy any number of Wi Fi access points and respective service areas within the wireless communications environment further comprise other mechanisms than LTE Femto specific mechanisms or devices other than LTE or Femto and comprise other network layers and technologies.

A UE device can contain some or all of the functionality of a system subscriber unit subscriber station mobile station mobile wireless terminal device mobile device remote station remote terminal access terminal user terminal terminal wireless communication device wireless communication apparatus user agent user device or UE device for example. A mobile device or UE can be a cellular telephone a cordless telephone a Session Initiation Protocol SIP phone a smart phone a feature phone a wireless local loop WLL station a personal digital assistant PDA a laptop a handheld communication device a handheld computing device a netbook a tablet a satellite radio a data card a wireless modem card and or another processing device for communicating over a wireless system. Each UE device can be served by the macro cell devices or micro cell devices in which handovers can be controlled by a network data data store a data set a data list neighbor relation table NRT or the like that is managed or maintained by the managing servers a macro network device a micro network device or the other network device for example. The UE devices can respectively broadcast an identifying signature or waveform which can be an identification or fingerprint that the network devices store from the UE devices as a time and frequency reference as well as for identification. Each waveform can be enumerated by the Physical Cell Identity PCI . The network devices of the network environment can communicate broadcasts with UE devices comprising a globally unique cell identifier CGI as well and the network devices of the communication environment can utilize UE ANR functions in which UE devices can decode and report CGI information of neighbor cells to the serving cell upon request.

For example a network device such as a macro cell network device or can maintain network data e.g. an NRT for each cell. The entries or candidates of the network data can comprise data that the network device utilizes about neighboring networks and network devices. Network device for example can have a complete knowledge of its neighbors such as of network device and . Network devices and can have a complete knowledge an incomplete knowledge or not be aware of all neighbors depending upon inaccuracies in signal propagation maps data or if a network has been newly installed.

In an example scenario networks can service UE devices and through one of the macro network devices or other micro access points . As a UE device travels within the wireless communications environment the respective UE device can move in and out of the coverage area of the associated serving network device. For example as a user is sending receiving communications through their respective UE device the user might be walking riding in a car riding on a train moving around a densely populated urban area e.g. a large city wherein the movement might cause the mobile device to be moved among various wireless communications networks. In such cases it is beneficial to route the network traffic e.g. handoff from a serving network to a target network in order to continue the communication e.g. avoid dropped calls . However macro network devices can have large network zones or coverage areas overlapping or with neighbor relations with micro cell network devices that are infrequently used and managed by the macro network devices or for example. If the small cell or micro network device neighbor relations are persistent in nature the neighbor lists in the NRT or other network data store can be truncated or can become too large to broadcast in a timely fashion. This can prevent mobile stations or other network devices from identifying sites or networks that are potential handover candidates and adversely affect mobile handover performance.

In an aspect infrequently used ephemeral or restricted access cells or network devices that have had neighbor relations created via an automated process such as ANR can be deleted after a relatively short delay of fixed calculated or operator settable duration with minimal impact on performance and signaling load. For example non macro layers such as the micro network devices can be removed from a network data in order to reduce impact and work with legacy macro systems comprising the macro network devices . Each macro eNB sector carrier or macro network device can support a limited number of X2 neighbor relations such as for example twenty four neighbor relations of other network devices communicatively coupled to one another. This list of 24 neighbors can include all heterogeneous network layers including macro network devices Pico network devices Femto network devices and the like. From the micro network device perspective a relatively large number of micro network devices e.g. FAP devices can have overlapping neighboring coverage with each corresponding macro network device e.g. macro eNB sector carrier device . As active UE in call or communicating UEs approach micro macro coverage boundaries the UE devices can detect and report new neighbor information PCI . If the detected PCI is not already populated as a neighbor in the data list or NRT the macro cell devices and managing servers e.g. eNB FAP Elemental Management System EMS and or MME can operate to exchange pertinent information to build an interface connection e.g. an X2 link and pertinent neighbor list entries. A network device such as the managing servers can operate to track the number of micro network device neighbors per macro network device as part of ANR behavior which can continue until the macro neighbor list or network data is full and unable to comprise more neighbor relationships. If the macro neighbor list is full for example a new X2 and neighbor setup connection will fail. This failure can operate as a trigger for the managing server or as a Femto cell EMS to begin heterogeneous neighbor list management.

The managing server or for example can determine the capacity for neighbor relations for a macro neighbor list corresponding to a particular network device e.g. macro network device or other network device etc. based on or in response to the failure to establish a new network connection or neighbor setup. The failure for example can indicate that the list table or data tracking the neighbor candidates or entries is full and the macro device is not operable to establish further network relations. The failure can operate as a trigger event in which the managing server or other network device e.g. macro network device maintaining the particular data set of candidate entries initiates management operations of the list. The capacity number can be determined according to the number of entries or potential handover candidates populated in the list at the time of the failure event. Alternatively or additionally the capacity number can be based on a statistical analysis of the number of failures occurring in the list to establish a network connection and the number of entries within the list or network data at those times. For example an average number based on a defined number of failure events over a period of time especially when failure instances could occur for one type of network relation but not for others for example.

In one embodiment a network device e.g. the managing server or other network device can determine a threshold number of micro network devices that are allowed to populate the list or network data for a macro network device e.g. the particular macro network device in response to the failure event or an analysis that a capacity number of neighbor relations is being reached with greater frequency over a period of time. The threshold number can be determined to be less than the capacity number and also determined based on a number of macro network devices within the neighbor list for a particular time or time period either before the failure trigger event or after. For example the threshold number of micro network devices allocated for neighbor entries of the data can be based on a number of macro network devices within the network data or list that the micro network devices have an overlapping coverage zone with at the time of the failure trigger. The basis for determining the threshold number can be a one to one correspondence another ratio or a capacity for each macro network device of the network data store being managed to establish neighbor relations with the micro network devices for example. The threshold number can be a number that initiates other trigger events for further analysis of the neighbor relation data and be considered as a threshold trigger or a soft threshold number for the additional analysis of neighbor relations within the communication environment . For example as new micro network devices are added the threshold number could be crossed or exceeded but not exceed the capacity number without a failure to establish a network neighbor relation occurring or having a high probability of occurring.

After a neighbor relation entry or the network data for handover candidates exceeds the capacity number further analysis of the network devices and statistical data corresponding to the different network devices within the network data as entries can be computed by the managing server or other network device in which the network data is associated with for maintaining neighbor relations. For example where a Femto network device keeps track of neighbor relations for each macro network device and the micro network devices when the micro network devices cross the threshold number within the data list the Femto network device can remove current micro network device candidates or entries from the list based on the statistical analysis of those candidates.

For example micro cell network devices can be ranked based on the number of attachment attempts by UE devices with respect to time or based on rates of attachment attempts by UE devices over a period of time from historical data collected. Different intervals of time could be considered and weighted for example based on a time of day certain days of the week seasonal dates or the like. Based on the rankings the network data could have certain micro network devices dropped as viable neighbor relation candidates and other or new network data relations can be added for a network device attempting to establish as a network candidate. The neighbor relation data thus becomes dynamic and updateable for each network device and corresponding neighbor relations when the list becomes overly large and or failure conditions operate as triggering events. Other examples and implementations are further detailed below.

Referring now to illustrated is an example non limiting wireless communications environment in accordance with various embodiments described. The wireless communications environment can include a heterogeneous network environment that has a multitude of wireless communications networks each having a respective coverage area. For example a macro network device facilitates a network coverage area or zone that neighbors other coverage areas of macro network devices and micro network devices . The coverage area of some of the wireless communications networks can overlap such that one or more network devices can provide coverage areas or zones to UEs or mobile devices whose coverage areas from different networks of network devices overlap. For example a relatively large number of FAP can have overlapping neighboring coverage with each macro eNB sector carrier such as with the macro network device . The network devices of the heterogeneous network environment can operate with one another as a Self Organizing Network SON in which at least some of the network devices can be configured to provide self configuration and self optimizing capabilities that provide the ability to automate certain operations management functions and system management functions such as in establishing network neighbor relations for potential handover of the UE device .

A management server is communicatively coupled to the macro network device and a network neighbor management component . The management server is configured to facilitate self configuration self optimization monitoring and operation management to allow the network devices to be communicatively coupled into the network and operate with little to no human intervention without delay for potential handover within the SON network environment . The management server can be configured to communicate event data to the network neighbor management component . For example the management server can operate to program and communicate trigger events to the network neighbor management component . A trigger event can comprise for example one or more events such as a failure of a network device e.g. a macro network device a micro network device to establish a neighbor relation entry or to establish an interface connection e.g. an X2 interface link with the macro network device or another network device. Although the network environment is illustrated for a macro sector carrier the macro network device other network devices of the heterogeneous network could also be considered and included for neighbor relations management via the management server and the network neighbor management component .

Additional trigger events can comprise a number of entries in a network data e.g. a data store candidate list NRT or the like satisfying a threshold condition with a threshold amount number and or satisfying a defined amount of neighbor relation entries relative to the threshold number. For example a threshold number of network device neighbor relations or handover candidates stored in the network data can be set as a trigger. The trigger event can occur in response to the threshold condition being satisfied such as meeting or exceeding a number of neighbor relations with macro network devices micro network devices a combination of macro and micro network devices in a particular ratio e.g. 1 to 1 2 to 1 or the like macro to micro devices with neighbor relations or thresholds corresponding respectively to a determined number of macro network devices and micro network devices for established neighbor relations. The threshold number or a defined number relative to the threshold number can be less than the capacity number. The defined number for example can be less than the threshold number which can enable a reserve capacity with respect to macro network devices or specifically for micro network devices to be able to establish future neighbor relations and initiate neighbor relation management operations in response to a trigger event for example.

The threshold can be determined by the management server and or the network neighbor management component . The threshold can comprise a number of data entries or neighbor relations corresponding to macro network device neighbor relations and or micro network device neighbor relations tracked with the data store . Additionally or alternatively the threshold can be determined based on a capacity of neighbor relations with respect to a network device such as the macro network device or in other words that are communicatively coupled to the macro network device or with which the macro network device is potentially initialized or set up with for handover operations. For example a capacity of neighbor relations for a macro sector carrier or macro network device could be twenty four entries as illustrated. However other capacities or numbers could also be determined based on a capacity of the network device e.g. macro network device to establish neighbor relations for potential handover candidates with the UE from the network area . For example the threshold number could be half the capacity number of network device neighbor relations entries or a number relative to the number of macro network device neighbor relations currently stored in the data store . For example the threshold number could be determined to be twelve micro network devices that the macro network device is operable to establish network neighbor relations with and perform handover operations for transfer of the UE device .

The threshold can comprise a number of micro cell network devices with neighbor relations for example that are determined based on a number of macro network devices with neighbor relation entries stored within a period of time in the data store . For example within an hour or other time period twelve macro network devices could have neighbor relations stored within the data store . As the micro network devices overlap with or share boundaries with the macro network devices the threshold number for neighbor relations with micro network devices can be determined to be ten or a number that is equal to or less than the number of macro network devices with neighbor relations already stored in the data store . Alternatively the threshold number of neighbor relations for micro network devices could be greater than the number of macro device neighbors tracked with the data store . The threshold number determined can also be less than the capacity number without a probability of failure occurring. Consequently a trigger can include the threshold number or threshold condition being satisfied such as a number of neighbor relations corresponding to the micro network devices exceeding or meeting the threshold number of relations designated for the micro network devices within the data store .

Further the management server is configured to determine a defined number of neighbor relations for a particular type of network device operating within the network environment such as for micro network devices which can include Femto cell devices Pico cell devices Metro cell devices and the like. The defined number can be a number that defines a defined condition as a trigger event for initiated management operations for the neighbor relations and the data store for example. The defined number can be defined specifically for all micro cell network devices and corresponding neighboring networks that are brought online or in communication with the network environment as potential neighbors for a particular macro network device e.g. . The defined number can be determined to be equal to or less than the threshold number for a threshold condition. For example the threshold number can be determined to be twelve for Femto or micro network devices because twelve macro network devices have established neighbor relations that the micro network devices can overlap with and or based on other factors such as the capacity number of network relations as discussed above. In addition the defined number can be determined based on the threshold number and be determined to be less than twelve such as ten. In this example a second or additional trigger event can be a micro network device attempting to connect or establishing neighbor relations with the macro sector carrier or macro network device . In this case the number of micro network devices with neighbor relations in the data store becomes eleven and exceeds the defined number. The number does not exceed the threshold number or the capacity number for neighbor relations but can further trigger management operations to ensure that the threshold is not exceeded.

In accordance with the above example the network management component is configured to further analyze the data store and the statistics of operation for the micro network devices . The network management component operates to determine a statistical use of the micro network devices . A statistical profile can be generated and stored within the data store corresponding to each one of the network devices. With regard to managing the micro network devices a statistical average of attach attempts can be determined as a function of an interval of time e.g. the last hour from the initialization or setup of the additional micro network device as a neighbor provided as part of the statistical profile. The number of attach attempts of UE device to the corresponding networks can be used to assess frequency of use common travel paths high usage for particular times data periods or time of the year with regard to seasonal use of the particular network. Work hours or lunch hours in a day could prompt more use during certain other hours for UE devices to travel through for example. A rate of attachment could be determined for each network device. As such the network neighbor management component can assess attach attempt rates of the micro network devices that have establish neighbor relations.

In addition UE device parameters can be also factored into the statistical profile for potential handover candidates with other network devices such as mobility location direction speed and the like as well as times and locations of the network devices or the network environment conditions for determining the priority of the micro network device and corresponding neighbor relations connections. For example where a new network device such as a new micro network device is more active during a certain time of day the time frame for analysis of the number of attach attempts could be delayed for the newly added neighbor connection with the new micro network devices because the management server or the network neighbor management component has ascertained this is a high activity time for this particular network relation compared to other times. Thus maintaining the neighbor relations and connections for the newly joining or connection network devices would be more efficient event though previous times have indicated little or no activity e.g. attach attempts .

The network neighbor management component is configured to prioritize and clean the network neighbor relations established and stored within the data store . The prioritization can be established based on a rank of the micro network devices which can increase or decrease in rank based on the statistical profile. For example the micro network device can comprise a high rate of attempts per time period e.g. within an hour time of day or other set of time period and dates . Conversely the micro network device has a number of low attach attempts per time period. The network neighbor management component can thus determine that micro network device has a higher rank or a higher priority than other micro network devices for maintaining neighbor relations or keeping a more permanent neighbor relation entry in the data store for example such as the micro network device . As a result the network neighbor management component is configured to delete or cancel the neighbor relation e.g. an X2 interface link corresponding to the micro network device . The entry can be deleted or canceled from the data store for identifying the micro network device such as with PCI or the neighbor information pertaining to the device . The network neighbor management component is configured to prioritize and cleanup the neighbor relations and corresponding data in the data store in order to decrease the number of neighbor relation entries for the data store to a number of micro network cell devices to be at or below the defined number. For example where the defined number is ten micro network devices and the number has increased beyond ten the network neighbor management component operates to maintain the defined number by prioritizing and removing micro network devices with established neighbor relations to satisfy the defined number for the defined condition. Alternatively or additionally the prioritization and removal operations generated by the network neighbor management component can be based on a tier of the statistical profile and ranks. For example a top tier of network devices and corresponding neighbor relations could be kept and a bottom tier could be removed by the prioritization and cleanup or removal operations initiated by the network neighbor management component . For example the micro network devices having a low attach attempt rate or low attach attempt success rate or an attach rate attempt that is below a bottom threshold e.g. no attempts within a period of time or equal to the attach attempt rate of the lowest micro network device could be removed to allow for further periods of time between prioritization and cleanup operations to be performed.

The management server and the network neighbor management component are configured to dynamically determine the various conditions e.g. the threshold condition the capacity number and or the defined condition and respective numbers based on the changing conditions of the neighbor relations. For example given the above example of data store can be expanded or decreased depending upon the determination of the threshold number for a threshold condition or the other conditions e.g. capacity condition number and or change in the defined condition number or success rate . When an increase in the number of macro network devices with neighbor relations for a given time period occurs the threshold number corresponding to the number micro network devices for neighbor relations could be changed and thus the defined number operating a trigger for prioritization and cleanup operations can also be re assessed or re determined.

The network neighbor management component can operate to analyze and manage the entries of the data store based on a period of time a trigger event occurring or being communicated via the management server for example. In response to a trigger event such as a failure of a network device establishing a neighbor relation or to be communicatively coupled to the macro network device via an entry in the data store or an interface connection failing to generate when a network device is detected the network neighbor management component can operate to determine data about the data store for a determination of the capacity number and a threshold number as another threshold event. For example the network neighbor management component can receive the failure event trigger and initiate data analysis that determines a number of macro network devices with neighbor relation entries in the data store the number of micro network devices and set a capacity number of total neighbor relation entries corresponding for the data store to store entries. The management server can analyze the data and determine a second threshold event in response based on the capacity number for neighbor relations to be established and other criteria discussed above such as a relative number of other network devices e.g. macro network devices micro network devices or other network devices that have established network neighbor relations e.g. X2 interface connections or some other interface link . The network neighbor management component the management server and or the macro network device can operate to determine and monitor the data store according to the threshold number determined as a second trigger mechanism. For example the threshold number could be determined to be twelve or a number less than the capacity number or number of macro network devices . The defined condition could be determined to be less than the threshold number based on a defined interval for reserve such as two less or less than two to enable other devices to establish network relations and maintain greater dynamics in establishing neighbor relations.

Consequently the operations of the network environment in a heterogeneous network of different macro and micro network devices with less coverage area and or overlapping the coverage zones of a macro network provide an automated means to optimize large neighbor lists in complex layered networks. Neighbors are maintained when where needed most and removed when where needed least. Mobility probability in a set of statistics or a statistical profile can be considered in the neighbor operations among the components devices of the network to before neighbors and neighbor relations connections e.g. neighbor networks and corresponding network devices are deleted. Thus the risk of a delayed handover neighbor list instability and associated signaling overhead can be reduced.

Referring now to illustrated is another example of the environment . A micro network has newly established neighbor connections with the macro network device and is operable as a potential handover candidate for the UE device . The management server is configured to detect the new network neighbor connection relationship with the macro network device for example and enters the data store with the identifying information e.g. PCI data or other identification data to operate normal neighbor relations automatically such as part of 3GPP ANR for LTE neighbors or for other network types e.g. 4GPP Wi Fi etc. . The management server can operate to communicate a trigger event in the case that a defined number for a defined condition has been satisfied or met such as when the number of micro network devices with neighbor relations established has exceed the defined number of ten or some other determined defined number.

The network neighbor management component can operate in response to the trigger event such as the defined number being less than the number of micro network devices neighbors that are set up or having interface connections for potential handover candidates within the network environment . In response to the trigger event the network neighbor management component can analyze the statistical or data of the statistical profile and perform prioritization and cleanup of the neighbor relations and ANR data of the data store as discussed above.

Referring now to illustrated is another example of the network environment in accordance with embodiments described. The network neighbor management component operates to resort the data of the neighbor relation statistics and determines different priorities based on different statistics of attach attempts over one or more time periods for analysis. As described above the network neighbor management component can determine a statistical profile of the networks devices such as the micro network devices that have initiated and established neighbor relations e.g. X2 or other interface links for each macro network device such as macro network device or other network devices.

The resorting operations of the network neighbor management component can result from the defined number e.g. 10 according to the above example being exceeded or met based on a defined condition being satisfied. The result of resorting or prioritization operations determines for example that the micro network device has increased in priority according to a different rank being determined from among the micro network devices . The statistical profile can comprise a graph or chart with respect to time or as a function of attach attempt clusters with respective dates or other graphical analysis that is dynamic for the statistics of each micro network device. Thus the micro network device has been moved upward relative to the position represented in of the example embodiments based on the change in priority for handover operations with the UE device or other UE device.

The network neighbor management component can operate to cancel the lowest priority network devices such as the micro network device . The network neighbor management component can initiate cleanup at various times and dynamically as network conditions or activity e.g. an increase in UE device data delivery or communications increase. The cleanup or removal of micro network devices for example can occur at the instance of the defined number being exceeded or in a time frame thereafter based on whether the newly added micro network device is included in the analysis or not. When the micro network device is included for cleanup the prioritization operations can be initiated after UE device operations are not continued or ceased or based on the probability of handover according to the UE devices mobility at the time of prioritization. Consequently UE device parameters can be factored into the statistical profile for potential handover candidates with other network devices and removed accordingly.

Referring now to illustrated is an example of network devices operable to manage neighbor relations corresponding to a network communication environment of a heterogeneous network. A network comprises a network device such as a Macro evolved NodeB device a Femto cell network device or other network cell device that operates to provide a coverage area for UE devices. The network device comprises a data store s a Radio Resource Control RRC component and a network neighbor management component .

The network device can be communicatively coupled to management server that can provide maintenance and operations control to the network device as well as ANR functions within 3GPP or other protocols. The data store can operate as a NRT to store and maintain neighbor entries for potential network neighbor candidates in a handover operation. The NRT entries can be managed or defined by the management server when ANR or neighbor relations management component is implemented. However base stations such as the network device can be launched without entries initially. Each NRT entry or neighbor relation connection can be uniquely identified by a target cell identifier. If the target cell is an LTE cell at the same frequency the identifier is the CGI and NRT also contains the PCI. It is the CGI that the network device uses when signaling to another network device via the management server since the management server can route messages based on network device identity which is a part of CGI. The CGI is also used when acquiring the IP address of another network device which is used for X2 interface or another interface e.g. S1 establishment. Additionally the NRT entry contains information about the interface connection availability whether the network neighbor management component can remove the neighbor relation and whether the neighbor relation can be used for handover or not.

The network neighbor management component can function to automatically add and remove entries to from NRT or data store . Additions are driven by the RRC component signaling between the network devices e.g. macro or micro network devices and mobiles which provides measurement control and reporting means. The RRC component can be used to define measurements of candidate cells which means that the mobiles or UE devices report measurement information to the serving base station or network device and upon request the mobile also decodes and reports the unique CGI information.

In one embodiment each network device e.g. macro eNB sector carrier can support a limited number of X2 neighbor relations e.g. a capacity number . For example the figures discussed above used the example of twenty four entries although other capacity numbers could also be functional depending upon the type of network device e.g. macro micro Wi Fi etc. . This list or network data of 24 neighbors includes all heterogeneous layers including macro Pico Femto etc. From the Femto network device or other micro network device perspective a relatively large number of FAP or micro network device access points have overlapping neighboring coverage with each macro network device e.g. a macro eNB sector carrier device. As active UE devices in call or communicating on the heterogeneous network approach the macro micro coverage boundaries they will detect and report new neighbor information PCI . If the detected PCI is not already populated as a neighbor the macro network device e.g. eNB the micro network device and or management server can exchange pertinent information to build an X2 link and pertinent neighbor list entries in the data store . The network neighbor management component can be specific for each macro and or micro network device e.g. as a Femto element management server EMS can operate to track the number of Femto neighbors per macro network device e.g. per macro eNB sector carrier . The network automatic neighbor behavior can continue until the neighbor list is full such as with macro network device neighbor relation entries or candidate entries. If the macro neighbor list is full the new X2 and neighbor setup will fail. This failure is a trigger for the network neighbor management component e.g. as Femto EMS to begin heterogeneous network neighbor list management.

For example assume the neighbor list maximum size capacity number is twenty four and the ANR failure occurs for the thirteenth micro neighbor addition attempt. In this case the network neighbor management component can automatically determine that the maximum number of micro network device neighbors is twelve or some other threshold number defined for the micro network devices. The network neighbors can be dynamic such as for Macro LTE neighbors and thus the neighbors can be added and subtracted as coverage and user distribution change. The network neighbor management component or the management server will occasionally or at defined intervals re test limits beyond twelve micro network device neighbors but the limit is assumed to be twelve for illustration.

Macro ANR neighbor additions for example can be relatively fast but removals can be relatively slow. Thus it can be impractical to remove neighbors fast enough to support fast additions when the neighbor list is otherwise full. For this reason the network neighbor management component can maintain at least one empty neighbor list position in this case to allow for rapid neighbor addition before neighbor re sorting and cleanup. In this case the maintained micro network device neighbor list size is ten as a defined number relative to the threshold number.

As active UE in call approach Micro Macro network device coverage boundaries they will detect and report new neighbor information PCI . If the detected PCI is not already populated as a neighbor the devices and components of the network will exchange pertinent information to build an X2 link or other interface connection and pertinent neighbor list entries are populated in the data store . This activity can result in a successful handover from macro network devices e.g. a macro LTE sector carrier to micro network devices e.g. a Femto network device . The network neighbor management component is configured to update the number of micro network device neighbors per macro network device. In this case the number of micro neighbors has increased from ten to eleven which is beyond the maintained micro network device neighbor list size threshold number .

The network neighbor management component can operate to be able to detect and remember the number and rate of attach attempts from nearby UE devices. This is an indication of the number of nearby users and their mobility. This is also an indication of the probability of more incoming handover attempts. That is in cases where more nearby UE device attempt exists to attach to the micro network device then there is a higher probability that at least one nearby UE device shall require handover to the micro network device. Ideally existing neighbor relations are in place before the handover is needed but not necessarily. Micro network devices with a high rate of attach attempts therefore require more permanent neighbor relations than micro network devices with a low rate of attach attempts. This therefore can reduce the need to repeatedly add and delete the same neighbor relation. Micro network devices with a low rate of attach attempts likely will not experience handover with a macro network device any time soon. Removing these neighbors quickly leaves neighbor list room and time for other micro network devices in a more active a dynamic network environment. For these reasons the micro network neighbors towards a specific macro sector carrier are ranked according to the rate of attach attempts. If necessary to remove neighbors to stay within the maintained micro network neighbor list size the defined number micro network devices with a low rate of attach attempts are removed first. Micro network device neighbor lists are constantly re sorted as new neighbors are added and deleted. Micro network device neighbor lists also expand or contract according to the detection mechanisms discussed above. According to the prior example the eleventh Femto neighbor was added. Next the Femto neighbor list is resorted according to the rate of attach attempts. Finally the eleventh Femto neighbor at bottom of the list lowest rate of attach attempts can be removed by the network neighbor management component for example. This clears space for new neighbors to be quickly added to the Micro Macro neighbor list as required. An advantage of these operations is that it enables heterogeneous networks to proactively adapt to dynamic neighbor scenarios typical for heterogeneous service areas.
