This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 663 546 filed Jun. 23 2012 and titled TARGETED CONTENT DELIVERY which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

An electronic social networking platform may store data about or otherwise related to users of the electronic social networking platform.

An application may extract data from an electronic social networking platform on behalf of users of the application who also are represented by user identities within the electronic social networking platform. This data extracted from the electronic social networking platform may include data about or otherwise related to the users of the application. In addition in some implementations this data extracted from the electronic social networking platform may include data about or otherwise related to user identities within the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of the users of the application.

The application may use the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to glean intelligence about the user identities for whom the application extracted data from the electronic social networking platform. Additionally or alternatively the application may use the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to identify segments of the user identities for whom the application extracted data from the electronic social networking platform who share certain characteristics and or satisfy certain criteria. After using data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to identify a particular segment of user identities who share one or more characteristics and or satisfy one or more criteria the application may deliver content that is specifically targeted to members of the particular segment to the user identities identified as belonging to the particular segment.

Referring first to is a schematic diagram that illustrates an example of targeted content delivery to mobile devices and associated with targeted user identities. The targeted content delivered to mobile devices and was delivered by an application that targeted the user identities associated with mobile devices and based on characteristics of the user identities that the application gleaned from data extracted from an electronic social networking platform. As illustrated in the targeted content delivered to mobile device is different from the targeted content delivered to mobile device . This may be attributable to the fact that the user identity associated with mobile device has different characteristics than the user identity associated with mobile device and therefore was targeted with different content by the application than the user identity associated with mobile device .

Mobile device is associated with a user identity identified as James. The underlying human user represented by the user identity James may be a user of both an electronic social networking platform and the application that delivered the content to mobile device . The electronic social networking platform stores various different data about or otherwise associated with the user identity James as a consequence of James use of the electronic social networking platform. For the purposes of the example illustrated in assume that the user profile for the user identity identified as James reflects that James lives in New York City and speaks English as his primary language. Further assume that based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform the application is able to infer that James is interested in business intelligence software.

Mobile device is associated with a user identity identified as Jacques. Like James the underlying human user represented by the user identity Jacques may be a user of both the electronic social networking platform and the application that delivered the content to mobile device . Furthermore the electronic social networking platform also stores various different data about or otherwise associated with the user identity Jacques as a consequence of Jacques use of the electronic social networking platform. For the purposes of the example illustrated in assume that the user profile for the user identity identified as Jacques reflects that Jacques lives in Montreal and speaks French as his primary language. Further assume that based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform the application is able to infer that Jacques is interested in business intelligence software.

By extracting data about or otherwise associated with the user identities James and Jacques from the electronic social networking platform the application may be able to glean various different characteristics of the user identities James and Jacques. The application then may utilize the characteristics of the user identities James and Jacques gleaned from the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to deliver specifically targeted content to the user identities James and Jacques. For example the application may deliver content to the user identity James that is specifically targeted to user identities having one or more the characteristics possessed by the user identity James. Similarly the application may deliver content to the user identity Jacques that is specifically targeted to user identities having one or more the characteristics possessed by the user identity Jacques.

In the specific example illustrated in the application may target user identities who are interested in business intelligence software with invitations to seminars about mobile business intelligence being conducted by the company MicroStrategy. However instead of sending the same general invitation to all user identities interested in business intelligence software the application may utilize characteristics of the user identities gleaned from data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to deliver targeted and potentially more personalized invitations to the user identities. For example because the application was able to glean that the user identity James lives in New York City and speaks English as his primary language the application delivered an English language invitation to James to attend the mobile business intelligence seminar being held in New York City. In addition the invitation included an offer for a free cup of coffee and a donut at Dunkin Donuts a coffee and donut shop found throughout New York City. Similarly because the application was able to glean that the user identity Jacques lives in Montreal and speaks French as his primary language the application delivered a French language invitation to Jacques to attend the mobile business intelligence seminar being held in Montreal. In addition the invitation included an offer for a free cup of coffee and a donut at Tim Hortons a coffee and donut shop found throughout Montreal.

There are many different examples of electronic social networking platforms. Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google MySpace and Orkut are just a few examples. But there are many others and it is reasonable to expect many more to be developed in the future. Techniques are described herein for extracting analyzing and or acting upon data from an electronic social networking platform. These techniques are widely applicable and may be employed in connection with any of the above electronic social networking platforms or any other electronic social networking platforms.

Electronic social networking platforms often enable an individual user identity to create a user profile that reflects various different types of information about or otherwise related to the user identity. Such a profile for a particular user identity may be helpful to other user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are interested in learning more about the particular user identity. Similarly the profile for the particular user identity may be helpful to the user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are interested in confirming that the particular user identity represents a particular human user within the electronic social networking platform.

For example an electronic social networking platform may maintain a user profile for a user identity that reflects the user identity s name gender age relationship status education history e.g. schools attended and or degrees awarded employment history e.g. employers and or positions held contact information e.g. e mail address es telephone number s other electronic addresses physical addresses etc. current residence information e.g. city state territory and or country hometown information e.g. city state territory and or country primary language and or sexual orientation.

Additionally or alternatively the user identity s profile also may reflect various different interests of the user identity and or indications of various different locations that the user identity or another user identity such as for example a member of the user identity s social network has registered with the electronic social networking platform as locations that the user identity has visited. Such locations may include a wide variety of different types of locations including for example geographic locations such as cities states or countries as well as commercial venues businesses or other places such as restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. For ease of reference indications of locations registered with an electronic social networking platform as locations that a user identity has visited may be referred to herein as check ins and information stored in a user identity s profile that reflects such indications of locations registered with the electronic social networking platform as locations that the user identity has visited may be referred to herein as check in information. 

Electronic social networking platforms also typically enable an individual user identity e.g. representing a human user who has registered with the electronic social networking platform and or a human user who has been assigned a unique or otherwise identifying identifier by the electronic social networking platform to establish connections with other user identities. These connections between user identities may reflect relationships between the underlying human users of the electronic social networking platform who are represented by the user identities. For example a connection between two user identities within an electronic social networking platform may reflect a social friendship e.g. developed through physical interaction in the real world and or through on line interaction in the cyber world or a professional relationship between the underlying human users represented by the user identities.

In some electronic social networking platforms user identities may be able to form connections with other user identities unilaterally. For example an electronic social networking platform may enable a first user identity to form a connection to a second user identity simply by requesting to form a connection to the second user identity without requiring authorization of the connection by the second user identity . Alternatively in other electronic social networking platforms the formation of connections between two user identities may involve bilateral participation by both user identities. For example in such electronic social networking platforms when a first user identity requests to form a connection to a second user identity the electronic social networking platform may establish the connection between the first and second user identities only after receiving authorization to form the connection from the second user identity.

A user identity s social network within an electronic social networking platform may be defined based on the connections between the user identity and other user identities of the electronic social networking platform. In some cases the social network of a particular user identity of an electronic social networking platform may be defined as the group of other user identities to whom the particular user identity is directly connected. Alternatively in other cases the social network of a particular user identity of an electronic social networking platform may be defined to extend beyond the group of other user identities to whom the particular user identity is directly connected to include other user identities who are within a threshold level of proximity to the particular user identity within the electronic social networking platform. For example social proximity between two user identities of an electronic social networking platform may be measured in terms of the number of degrees of separation or the number of other intermediate interconnected user identities required to form a connection between the two user identities within the electronic social networking platform and the social network of a particular user identity within the electronic social networking platform may be defined to include a group of other user identities who are within a threshold number of degrees of separation of the particular user identity.

Commonly an electronic social networking platform may provide a particular user identity with certain increased functionality in connection with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform that the electronic social networking platform may not provide to the particular user identity in connection with user identities who are not members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform. For example an electronic social networking platform may provide a particular user identity with one or more different mechanisms for electronically communicating or otherwise sharing content with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform. Furthermore an electronic social networking platform may allow a particular user identity to access more detailed profile information about other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform than the electronic social networking platform allows the particular user identity to access about user identities who are not members of the particular user identity s social network. Additionally or alternatively an electronic social networking platform may enable a particular user identity to access check ins registered with the electronic social networking platform by members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform while not enabling the particular user identity to access check ins registered with the electronic social networking platform by user identities who are not members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform.

The connections between individual user identities within an electronic social networking platform may be represented in the form of a graph where user identities are represented by nodes and connections between user identities are represented by edges connecting the nodes. As new user identities join and other user identities stop using the electronic social networking platform and or as new connections between user identities are formed and old connections between user identities are dissolved this graph of interconnected user identities may change dynamically in time to represent the current state of connections between user identities within the electronic social networking platform.

As further discussed above an electronic social networking platform may facilitate the sharing of information and the exchange of electronic communications between a particular user identity and other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform. For example referring to the electronic social networking platform represented in the electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of electronic communications between the user identity represented by node and the user identities represented by nodes who are members of the social network of the user identity represented by node . In some implementations the electronic social networking platform may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node to send private electronic messages to any one or more of the user identities represented by nodes . Furthermore the electronic social networking platform also may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node to publish an electronic message e.g. a status post that is broadcast to all or some defined subset of all of the user identities represented by nodes . Additionally or alternatively the electronic social networking platform may provide a mechanism that enables the user identity represented by node to send a directed electronic message to a user identity who is represented by a particular one of nodes . In such cases the recipient user identity of the directed message may define whether this directed message is shared publicly with other user identities of the electronic social networking platform.

In addition to enabling user identities to establish connections to other user identities an electronic social networking platform also may enable user identities to establish connections with other types of objects. Among other examples such other types of objects may include interest objects location objects event objects and application objects.

Interest objects may represent a variety of different types of interests including for example local businesses or places e.g. restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. companies organizations or institutions brands or products artists bands or public figures media or other forms of entertainment e.g. books music albums movies etc. and causes or communities. As described in greater detail below in connection with interest objects may be manifested within an electronic social networking platform as so called pages that provide information about the interests that the interest objects represent. These pages may be maintained by one or more representatives of the interests that the interest objects represent.

An electronic social networking platform that supports interest objects may enable an individual user identity to record various different interests within the electronic social networking platform by registering endorsements of the interest objects that represent the user identity s interests with the electronic social networking platform. The electronic social networking platform may represent the individual user identity s endorsement of different interest objects within the electronic social networking platform as connections between the user identity and the interest objects that the user identity has endorsed. Furthermore the electronic social networking platform may provide various different mechanisms that enable the one or more representatives of a particular interest object to share electronic communications or otherwise interact with those user identities who have endorsed the particular interest object. For example the electronic social networking platform may enable the one or more representatives of the particular interest object to publish status posts including for example text images and or videos that are broadcast publicly to user identities who have endorsed the particular interest object.

Location objects may represent a variety of different types of locations including for example geographic locations such as cities states or countries as well as commercial venues businesses or other places such as restaurants retail stores parks train or bus stations airports etc. An electronic social networking platform that supports location objects may enable an individual user identity to form various different types of connections to different location objects. For example an electronic social networking platform may enable a user identity to record information about the user identity s hometown by establishing a hometown connection with a location object that represents the user identity s hometown. Similarly an electronic social networking platform may enable a user identity to record information about the user identity s current place of residence by establishing a current city connection with a location object that represents the user identity s current place of residence. Additionally or alternatively an electronic social networking platform may enable a user identity to register locations that the user identity has visited by establishing check in connections with location objects that represent locations that the user identity has visited.

In some cases an electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to manually check in at a location. For example a social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to manually define and or search for a location object that corresponds to a location that the user identity is visiting or has visited or plans to visit and create a connection to the location object that corresponds to the location in order to check in at the location. Additionally or alternatively an electronic social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to check in at a location in a more intelligent or automated fashion. For instance a social networking platform may provide mechanisms that enable a user identity to check in at a location using a mobile computing device e.g. a smartphone or tablet computer using global positioning system GPS map and or other location identifying data available to the mobile computing device.

Event objects may represent events hosted by user identities of an electronic social networking platform and or events hosted by representatives of interest objects. Furthermore event objects may include mechanisms that enable the hosts of the events represented by the event objects to invite user identities to the events. In some electronic social networking platforms event objects may be manifested within the electronic social networking platforms as event pages that provide information about the events the event objects represent e.g. date time and location information for the events and the electronic social networking platforms may enable one or more designated representatives associated with the event e.g. the hosts to share information and exchange electronic communications with user identities who have been invited to the event via the event page. 

An electronic social networking platform that supports event objects may establish a connection between an event object and the user identity or interest object responsible for hosting the event represented by the event object. In addition the electronic social networking platform also may establish a connection between an event object and user identities who have been invited to the event represented by the event object and or user identities who register with the electronic social networking platform that they will be attending the event represented by the event object.

As described in greater detail below electronic social networking platforms may enable independent applications to leverage the electronic social networking platforms for example to provide more compelling user experiences for the users of the independent applications by accessing and or extracting data from the electronic social networking platforms generally on behalf of user identities who have granted the independent applications authorization to access and or extract data from the electronic social networking platforms on their behalf. Application objects in an electronic social networking platform thus may represent different applications that leverage the electronic social networking platform.

A wide variety of different types of applications may leverage electronic social networking platforms. Among other examples gaming applications are one common example of applications that leverage electronic social networking platforms. Such gaming applications may allow user identities to engage in interactive or multiplayer games that involve other user identities of the electronic social networking platforms that they leverage. Other examples of types of applications that may leverage electronic social networking platforms include social electronic marketplace applications social event management applications content delivery and sharing applications collaboration applications and social recommendation applications.

An electronic social networking platform that supports application objects may establish connections between an individual application that leverages the electronic social networking platform and user identities who are users of the application represented by the application object and or who are users who have granted the application represented by the application object authorization to access or extract data from the electronic social networking platform on their behalf. Furthermore the electronic social networking platform may provide various different mechanisms that enable an application that leverages the social networking platform to share electronic communications or otherwise interact with those user identities for whom connections have been established with the application object that represents the application within the electronic social networking platform. For example the electronic social networking platform may enable an application that leverages the electronic social networking platform and or users of the application that leverages the electronic social networking platform to transmit communications within the electronic social networking platform to user identities for whom connections have been established with the application object that represents the application within the electronic social networking platform.

As illustrated in an edge that connects two nodes represents a connection between the two objects that are represented by the connected nodes . For example the edges that connect node to nodes represent connections between the user identity represented by node and the user identities represented by nodes . For ease of reference such a connection between two user identity objects in an electronic social networking platform may be referred to herein as a friend connection. 

Similarly the edge that connects node to node represents a connection between the user identity represented by node and the interest object represented by node . As discussed above a user of an electronic social networking platform may form a connection to such an interest object by endorsing the interest object. Therefore for ease of reference connections between a user identity object and an interest object in an electronic social networking platform may be referred to herein as an endorsement connection. 

Furthermore the edges that connect node to nodes represent connections between the user identity represented by node and the location objects represented by nodes . Depending on the electronic social networking platform a user identity may be able to establish various different types of connections to location objects. For example in order to store a record of the user identity s hometown the user identity may establish what may be referred to herein as a hometown connection to a location object that represents the user identity s hometown. Additionally or alternatively in order to store a record of the user identity s current residence the user identity may establish what may be referred to herein as a current city or current residence connection to a location object that represents the user identity s current residence. Furthermore in order to store a record of a location the user identity visited the user identity may establish what may be referred to herein as a check in connection to a location object that represents a location that the user identity visited.

The edge that connects node to node represents a connection between the user identity represented by node and the event represented by event object . For ease of reference such a connection between a user identity object and an event object may be referred to herein as an event connection. There may be various different types of event connections between user identities and event objects in an electronic social networking platform. For example one type of an event connection between a user identity and an event object in an electronic social networking platform may signify that the user identity is the host of the event. Another type of an event connection between a user identity and an event object in an electronic social networking platform may signify that the user identity has been invited to the event. Still another type of event connection between a user identity and an event object in an electronic social networking platform may signify that the user identity has registered with the electronic social networking platform that the user identity will be attending the event. Yet another type of event connection between a user identity and an event object in an electronic social networking platform may signify that the user identity has registered with the electronic social networking platform that the user identity will not be attending the event. Still one more type of event connection between a user identity and an event object in an electronic social networking platform may signify that the user identity has registered with the electronic social networking platform that the user identity tentatively will be attending the event.

Finally the edge that connects node to node represents a connection between the user identity represented by node and the application represented by application object . For ease of reference such a connection between a user identity object and an application objected may be referred to here as an application connection. 

Electronic social networking platforms may provide various different types of user interfaces for interacting with the electronic social networking platforms. For example for each user of an electronic social networking platform the electronic social networking platform may provide a first GUI that generally presents a feed of content shared by or otherwise related to other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network as well as content shared by or otherwise related to other objects e.g. interest location event and or application objects to which the user identity is connected within the electronic social networking platform. In some electronic social networking platforms this feed may be referred to as the user identity s news feed. In addition the electronic social networking platform also may provide a second GUI for each user identity of the electronic social networking platform that presents a feed that generally records the activity of the user identity within the electronic social networking platform as well as content shared with the user identity directly by other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network and or by other objects to which the user identity is connected within the electronic social networking platform e.g. interest location event and or application objects . In some electronic social networking platforms this feed may be referred to as the user identity s wall or timeline. 

An electronic social networking platform may include a variety of different content in a user identity s news feed. For example among other types of content a particular user identity s news feed may include i electronic messages such as for example status posts and other content such as for example images videos and or links that have been published generally by other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network ii electronic messages and other content such as for example images videos and or links that have been published publicly by other types of objects e.g. interest location event and application objects to which the particular user identity is connected within the electronic social networking platform iii electronic messages such as for example walls posts or timeline posts and other content such as for example images videos and or links that have been shared directly with recipient user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network and who have configured their privacy settings to share such directed electronic messages and other content with the particular user identity and or iv information about activities engaged in within the context of the electronic social networking platform by other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network such as for example check ins events hosted and or attended and application usage e.g. participation in a gaming application .

Similarly an electronic social networking platform may include a variety of different content in a user identity s wall or timeline. For example among other types of content a particular user identity s wall or timeline may include i electronic messages such as for example status posts and other content such as for example images videos and or links that the particular user identity published generally to other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network ii electronic messages such as for example wall posts or timeline posts and other content such as for example images videos and or links that the particular user identity shared directly with specific members of the particular user identity s social network iii electronic messages such as for example wall posts or timeline posts and other content such as for example images videos and or links that user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network shared directly with the particular user identity iv electronic messages such as for example wall posts or timeline posts and other content such as for example images videos and or links that applications to which the particular user identity is connected within the electronic social networking platform shared directly with the particular user identity and or v information about activities engaged in within the context of the electronic social networking platform by the user identity such as for example check ins events hosted and or attended and application usage e.g. participation in a gaming application .

Referring first to GUI includes a news feed that includes different feed items . The items included within news feed include content and or electronic messages that have been shared with James by other user identities who are members of James social network as well as by other types of objects e.g. interest location event and application objects to which James is connected within the electronic social networking platform.

For example item includes an image and a corresponding message shared with James by a member of James social network identified as John. Similarly item includes a message e.g. a status post shared with James by a member of James social network identified as Jane and item includes a hyperlink to a web page and a corresponding message shared with James by a member of James social network identified as Joe. Although not illustrated in in addition to enabling user identities to share images and hyperlinks with members of their social networks e.g. as illustrated by items and respectively the electronic social networking platform also may enable user identities to share other types of content with members of their social networks including for example videos. Items and may represent content and or messages that the particular user identities who shared these items i.e. John Jane and Joe respectively published generally to user identities who are members of their own social networks.

In addition to enabling user identities to publish electronic messages and other content generally to other user identities who are members of their social networks the electronic social networking platform also may enable user identities to send directed messages and other content to individual user identities who are members of their social networks. Such directed messages and other content may be presented within the walls or timelines of the user identities to whom they are targeted. Therefore these directed messages and other content may be referred to as wall posts or timeline posts. The electronic social networking platform may provide user identities with controls for configuring whether such directed messages and other content posted to their walls or timelines also are shared with members of their own social networks. In the event that a targeted user identity selects configuration settings that provide for directed messages and other content posted to the targeted user s wall or timeline to be shared with other members of the targeted user identity s social network such wall posts or timeline posts may be presented to the other members of the targeted user identity s social network in their news feeds. 

Item in the news feed of the GUI is an example of a wall post or timeline post that was directed to a targeted user identity who is a member of James social network and who selected configuration settings that provide for the wall post or timeline post to be shared with other members of the targeted user identity s own social network. More particularly message was posted to the wall or timeline of a member of James social network identified as John by another user identity identified as Jane. Because the user identity identified as John is a member of James social network and because the user identity identified as John selected configuration settings that provide for wall posts or timeline posts to be shared with other members of his social network the wall post or timeline post from the user identity identified as Jane is presented in James news feed . The user identity identified as Jane may or may not be a member of James own social network.

 News feed also includes information about activities engaged in within the context of the electronic social networking platform by other user identities who are members of James social network. For example item indicates that a user identity identified as Joe checked in at a location identified as World Caf . The location World Caf may be represented as a location object within the electronic social networking platform and may correspond to for example a local restaurant.

The items included within news feed also include content and or electronic messages that have been shared with James by other types of objects e.g. interest location event and application objects to which James is connected within the electronic social networking platform. For example item includes a message shared with James by an interest object manifested as a page within the electronic social networking platform that represents MicroStrategy Incorporated a software and technology company.

Invitations to events that a user identity receives within the electronic social networking platform also may be presented in the user identity s news feed. For example item in news feed represents an invitation to an event named Housewarming Party being held on April 17 in Washington DC that was sent to James by a user identity who is a member of James social network identified as Joe. As illustrated in item includes a selectable View control that when invoked may provide James with more information about the Housewarming Party event. In addition item also includes a selectable Join control that enables James to register with the electronic social networking platform that he will be attending the Housewarming Party event. As discussed above the Housewarming Party event may be represented as an event object within the electronic social networking platform.

The items presented in news feed provide mechanisms that enable James to react to the content included within the items presented in news feed . For example as illustrated in each of the items presented in news feed includes a selectable Endorse control and a selectable Comment control .

A selectable Endorse control in an item enables James to register an endorsement of the content e.g. message image video link activity etc. included in the item . The electronic social networking platform records such endorsements and may present the number of endorsements registered in connection with the content presented in an item in connection with the presentation of the item itself. For example item includes an indication that six different user identities have registered endorsements of the picture and message included in item .

A selectable Comment control in an item enables the particular user identity to enter a responsive comment to the content included in the item . The electronic social networking platform records such responsive comments and associates them with the content included in the item so that the electronic social networking platform may present any such responsive comments in connection with the presentation of the item itself. For example item includes a message by a user identity identified as Joe that was entered in response to the message originally posted by the user identity identified as Jane.

In addition to news feed GUI also includes a selectable Post A Message control a selectable Share A Photo Video control and an associated text entry field and selectable Post control . Selectable Post A Message control enables James to compose and publish a status post by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control . Similarly selectable Share A Photo Video control enables James to share a picture or a video and to compose and publish a corresponding status post by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control .

Referring now to GUI includes a wall or timeline feed that includes different feed items . The items included within the wall or timeline feed include content and or electronic messages that the user identity identified as James shared with other members of his social network. Such content and or electronic messages may include status posts that James published generally to members of his social network responsive comments that James entered in response to content and or messages shared by other user identities who are members of James social network and wall or timeline posts that James posted to the walls or timelines of specific user identities who are members of his social network.

For example item includes a status post that James published generally to user identities who are members of his social network. Similarly item includes an image and a corresponding message that James published generally to user identities who are members of his social network. In the event that user identities who are members James social network enter responsive comments to and or endorse status posts that James published generally to user identities who are members of his social network any such responsive comments or endorsements also may be presented within wall or timeline feed . For example item includes an indication that two user identities have endorsed message . Similarly item includes a message that was entered by a user identity who is a member of James social network identified as Joe in response to the picture and corresponding message originally posted by James.

Meanwhile item includes a responsive comment that James posted in response to content and or a message shared by a user identity who is a member of James social network identified as John. Item also includes a wall post or timeline post that James posted on the wall or timeline of a specifically targeted user identity who is a member of James social network identified as Joe.

The items included in wall feed or timeline feed also include content and or messages that were posted directly on James wall or timeline by user identities who are members of James social network. For example item includes a message that was posted directly on James wall or timeline by a user identity who is a member James social network identified as Jane.

In addition the items in wall or timeline feed also include information about activities that James has engaged in within the context of the electronic social networking platform. For example item includes an indication that James has endorsed the MicroStrategy Incorporated interest object as well as four additional interest objects all of which as described in greater detail below in connection with may be manifested within the electronic social networking platform in the form of individual pages. Meanwhile item includes an indication that James has established a connection within the electronic social networking platform to the user identity identified as Jane.

Although not illustrated in a user identity s wall or timeline feed also may include content and or messages that were shared with the user identity as a consequence of the user identity s interaction with an application that leverages the electronic social networking platform. For example in some cases an application that leverages the electronic social networking application may post messages to the user identity s wall or timeline. Additionally or alternatively another user identity may originate a message to the user identity within an application that leverages the electronic social networking platform and the application then may cause the message from the other user identity that originated within the application to be posted to the user identity s wall or timeline. 

In addition to wall or timeline feed GUI also includes a profile section that presents a snapshot of profile information for the user identity identified as James. As illustrated in profile section includes information about James employment history software developer at MicroStrategy education history Massachusetts Institute of Technology current residence Washington DC hometown Chicago and birthday July 4 .

As with GUI GUI also includes a selectable Post A Message control a selectable Share A Photo Video control and an associated text entry field and selectable Post control . Selectable Post A Message control enables James to compose and publish a status post by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control . Similarly selectable Share A Photo Video control enables James to share a picture or a video and to compose and publish a corresponding status post by entering text in associated text entry field and invoking selectable Post control .

As discussed above in some electronic social networking platforms interests may be represented as interest objects that are manifested within the electronic social networking platform as pages. is a diagram of an example of a GUI for an example of an electronic social networking platform within which interests are represented as interest objects that are manifested within the electronic social networking platform as pages. More particularly GUI displays the MicroStrategy page corresponding to the MicroStrategy interest object that represents the software and technology company MicroStrategy within the electronic social networking platform.

As illustrated in the MicroStrategy page includes a description section that provides background information about MicroStrategy. The MicroStrategy page also includes a feed that includes among other content messages generated by the MicroStrategy page and published to user identities of the electronic social networking platform who have endorsed the MicroStrategy page or otherwise established a connection to the MicroStrategy page within the electronic social networking platform. In addition as further illustrated in the feed also includes messages posted directly to the MicroStrategy page by user identities of the electronic social networking platform. The electronic social networking platform may provide a variety of different mechanisms that enable user identities of the electronic social networking platform to post messages directly to a page such as for example the MicroStrategy page . In one example the electronic social networking platform may enable a user identity to post a message directly to the MicroStrategy page by entering text in text entry field and invoking selectable Post control . Although not illustrated as such in feed also may include various additional or alternative types of content.

The MicroStrategy page also includes a selectable Endorse control that enables user identities who view the MicroStrategy page and who have not already endorsed MicroStrategy to record an endorsement of MicroStrategy as one of their interests. In response to invocation of selectable Endorse control by a particular user identity the electronic social networking platform records that the particular user identity has endorsed MicroStrategy as an interest for example by establishing a connection between the user identity and the interest object that represents MicroStrategy within the electronic social networking platform. As illustrated in the MicroStrategy page also includes an indication reporting that 7 443 user identities already have endorsed MicroStrategy within the electronic social networking platform.

In some electronic social networking platforms interests endorsed by a particular user identity may be shared with or otherwise made available to other user identities of the electronic social networking platform. In particular in some electronic social networking platforms interests endorsed by a particular user identity may be shared with other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network. For example an electronic social networking platform may provide user identities who are members of a particular user identity s social network with access to a detailed user identity profile page that includes among other information indications of interests that the particular user identity has endorsed within the electronic social networking platform.

As described above an electronic social networking platform may enable independent applications to leverage the electronic social networking platform for example to provide more compelling user experiences for the users of the independent applications by accessing and or extracting data from the electronic social networking platforms.

Electronic social networking platform may be implemented using one or more computing devices e.g. servers configured to provide a service to one or more client devices e.g. computing device connected to electronic social networking platform over network . The one or more computing devices on which electronic social networking platform is implemented may have internal or external storage components storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. The one or more application programs may be implemented as instructions that are stored in the storage components and that when executed cause the one or more computing devices to provide the features of an electronic social networking platform . Furthermore the one or more computing devices on which electronic social networking platform is implemented each may include one or more processors for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . In addition these computing devices also typically may include network interfaces and communication devices for sending and receiving data. Electronic social networking platform also may provide an application programming interface API that enables other applications to interact with and extract data from the electronic social networking platform .

Computing system also may be implemented using one or more computing devices e.g. servers . The one or more computing devices on which computing system is implemented may have internal or external storage components storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. The one or more application programs may be implemented as instructions that are stored in the storage components and that when executed cause the one or more computing devices to provide the functionality ascribed herein to the computing system . Furthermore the one or more computing devices on which computing system is implemented each may include one or more processors for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . In addition these computing devices also typically may include network interfaces and communication devices for sending and receiving data.

As described in greater detail below computing system hosts an independent application that leverages electronic social networking platform to provide a service to one or more client devices e.g. computing device . As such computing system is configured to extract and store data from electronic social networking platform . For example computing system may be configured to exploit API to extract data from electronic social networking platform .

Network may provide direct or indirect communication links between electronic social networking platform computing system and computing device . Examples of network include the Internet the World Wide Web wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs including wireless LANs WLANs analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks radio television cable satellite and or any other delivery mechanisms for carrying data.

Computing device may be any of a number of different types of computing devices including for example a tablet computer as illustrated in or a mobile phone a smartphone a personal digital assistant a laptop or netbook computer or a desktop computer. Furthermore computing device typically may have internal or external storage components for storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. In particular the internal or external storage components for computing device may store a client application for interfacing with electronic social networking platform and or a client application for interfacing with computing system . Additionally or alternatively computing device may be configured to interface with electronic social networking platform or computing system without a specific client application using for example a web browser. As such one or more user identities of electronic social networking platform may be able to use computing device to access electronic social networking platform . Similarly one or more users of the independent application that leverages electronic social networking platform hosted by computing system may be able to use computing device to access the independent application.

Computing device also typically may include a central processing unit CPU for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . Computing device also usually may include one or more communication devices for sending and receiving data. One example of such communications devices is a modem. Other examples include antennas transceivers communications cards and other network adapters capable of transmitting and receiving data over a network e.g. network through a wired or wireless data pathway.

As illustrated in the electronic social networking platform may be represented in the form of a graph where user identities are represented by nodes and connections between user identities are represented by edges connecting the nodes. The electronic social networking platform may enable individual user identities to construct social networks within the electronic social networking platform by establishing connections with other user identities. Electronic social networking platform enables user identities who are members of a social network within electronic social networking platform to share various different types of data and other content e.g. including electronic messages with each other within the context of the electronic social networking platform .

Furthermore in addition to the service s that electronic social networking platform itself provides to user identities electronic social networking platform also provides mechanisms e.g. API that enable independent applications to leverage electronic social networking platform to provide services to user identities of the electronic social networking platform . For example among other features electronic social networking platform enables user identities of electronic social networking platform to grant access tokens or some other form of access mechanism or access right e.g. a password or PIN to such independent applications that authorize the independent applications to which the tokens are granted to extract data from electronic social networking platform on behalf of the user identities.

In some implementations the token or other form of access mechanism or access right e.g. a password or PIN that a particular user identity grants to an independent application may enable the independent application to access and or extract the particular user identity s user profile data as well as the user profile data for any other user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform . Additionally or alternatively the token or other form of access mechanism or access right e.g. a password or PIN that the particular user identity grants to the independent application may enable the independent application to access and or extract data shared or received by the particular user identity within the electronic social networking platform as well as data shared or received by any other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network within the electronic social networking platform .

As discussed above computing system hosts an independent application that leverages electronic social networking platform . The electronic social networking platform is accessible to the application hosted by computing system over network and for example via API . In addition the application hosted by computing system is accessible to client devices e.g. computing device also over network .

As illustrated in in order for the application hosted by computing system to extract data about or otherwise related to a particular user identity and or other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network from electronic social networking platform the particular user identity first may grant the application hosted by computing system a token or some other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN that authorizes the application to extract such data from the electronic social networking platform on behalf of the particular user identity. Upon acquiring a token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN for the particular user identity the application thereafter may transmit the token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN to electronic social networking platform along with requests to extract data from the electronic social networking platform on behalf of the particular user identity. Although schematically illustrates token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN as being transmitted to the application hosted by computing system from the computing device of the particular user identity e.g. computing device it will be understood that token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN actually may be transmitted to the application by the electronic social networking platform e.g. after being authorized to do so by the particular user identity . 

Referring now to when electronic social networking platform receives a request from the application hosted by computing system on behalf of the particular user identity to extract data about or otherwise related to the particular user identity and or other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network from electronic social networking platform that is accompanied by the appropriate token authorizing the application to extract data from the electronic social networking platform on behalf of the particular user identity the electronic social networking platform locates and returns the requested data about or otherwise related to the particular user identity and or other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network to the application hosted by computing system .

In some implementations the application hosted by computing system may extract the following data about or otherwise related to the particular user identity from the electronic social networking platform name gender birthday and or age current city hometown relationship status sexual orientation primary language employment history education history contact information e.g. mailing address es e mail address es phone number s etc. interests recorded with the electronic social networking platform e.g. by endorsing interest objects manifested as pages within the electronic social networking platform check ins registered with the electronic social networking platform event information for events to which the particular user identity has been invited within the context of the electronic social networking platform status posts published by the particular user identity to other user identities who are members of the particular user identity s social network and any related responsive comments and or endorsements and wall posts or timeline posts received by the particular user identity.

Additionally or alternatively the application hosted by computing system also may extract the following data N about or otherwise related to each other user identity who is a member of the particular user identity s social network from the electronic social networking platform name gender birthday and or age current city hometown relationship status sexual orientation primary language employment history education history contact information e.g. mailing address es e mail address es phone number s etc. interests recorded with the electronic social networking platform e.g. by endorsing interest objects manifested as pages within the electronic social networking platform check ins registered with the electronic social networking platform event information for events to which the user identity has been invited within the context of the electronic social networking platform status posts published by the user identity to other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network and any related responsive comments and or endorsements and wall posts or timeline posts received by the user identity.

The application hosted by computing system may extract from the electronic social networking platform data about or otherwise related to each user identity for whom the application hosted by computing system has received a token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN . Additionally or alternatively the application hosted by computing system may extract from the electronic social networking platform data about or otherwise related to the other user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of each user identity for whom the application hosted by computing system has received a token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN . In this manner in some implementations the application hosted by computing system may extract from the electronic social networking platform data about or otherwise related to user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are not also users of the application hosted by computing system .

After extracting data from the electronic social networking platform the application hosted by computing system may store the extracted data e.g. in the storage components accessible to computing system . More particularly in some implementations the application hosted by computing system may store the extracted data in one or more databases. For example the application hosted by computing system may store the extracted data in one or more on line transaction processing OLTP databases. Such OLTP databases may be implemented as relational or other forms of databases.

As described in greater detail below the application hosted by computing system may process the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to glean intelligence about the users of the application and or the other user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of the users of the application. In some such implementations the application hosted by computing system may process the extracted data stored in the database s and load the processed data into a data warehouse e.g. an on line analytical processing OLAP data warehouse that may facilitate analyzing and or acting upon the processed data.

In order to keep the data that is available to the application hosted by computing system generally synchronized with the data in the electronic social networking platform the application hosted by computing system occasionally may repeat the extraction from the electronic social networking platform of data about or otherwise related to each user identity for whom the application hosted by computing system has received a token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN as well as data about or otherwise related to other user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of each user identity for whom the application hosted by computing system has received a token or other form of access mechanism or right e.g. a password or PIN .

The application hosted by computing system may use the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform for a variety of different purposes. For example the application hosted by computing system may use the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to provide a compelling user experience for users of the application that is tied into the users social networks.

Additionally or alternatively as suggested above the application hosted by computing system may process the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform to glean intelligence about the users of the application and or the other user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of the users of the application. The application then may utilize this intelligence to transmit targeted content to user identities for example by identifying segments of user identities who share one or more characteristics and transmitting content perceived as relevant attractive or appealing to these segments to the user identities identified as belonging to the segments.

Referring now to the application hosted by computing system may enable an administrator or other representative associated with the application to access the data that the application extracts from the electronic social networking platform and to otherwise interact with the application hosted by computing system for example via a computing device . Computing system may be accessible to computing device over a network connection e.g. network or any other form of communication mechanism capable of carrying data. Computing device may be any of a number of different types of computing devices including for example a desktop computer a laptop or netbook computer a tablet computer a mobile phone a smartphone or a personal digital assistant. Furthermore computing device typically may have internal or external storage components for storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. In particular the internal or external storage components for computing device may store a client application for interfacing with computing system . Additionally or alternatively computing device may be configured to interface with computing system without a specific client application using for example a web browser.

In some implementations the application hosted by computing system may provide a representative of the application with various tools for manipulating and analyzing the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform. Additionally or alternatively the application hosted by computing system may provide a representative of the application with tools that enable the representative of the application to define one or more segments of user identities who share one or more characteristics or who otherwise satisfy one or more criteria and to target these segments for delivery of content perceived as being highly relevant attractive or appealing to these segments. Such tools may reside on or otherwise be provided by computing system . Additionally or alternatively such tools may be provided within a client application that is resident on computing device and that is configured to enable the client application to access the application hosted by computing system .

Depending upon the application and the scope of the information that the application extracts from the electronic social networking platform in some implementations the analysis and segmentation of user identities of the electronic social networking platform enabled by the application may be limited to analysis of user identities who also are users of the application. In other implementations the application may enable analysis and segmentation of user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are users of the application as well as user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are members of the social networks of the user identities who are users of the application. The discussion of the analysis and segmentation of user identities of the electronic social networking platform enabled by the application that follows will not generally distinguish user identities of the electronic social networking platform who also are users of the application from user identities of the electronic social networking platform who are not also users of the application. Instead the following discussion generally will focus on the analysis and segmentation enabled by the application of user identities of the electronic social networking platform for whom the application extracts data from the electronic social networking platform irrespective of whether the user identities are users of the application or are members of the social networks of users of the application.

As discussed above the application may extract a wide variety of different types of information from the electronic social networking platform for each user identity for whom the application extracts information from the electronic social networking platform. For example for each user identity for whom the application extracts information from the electronic social networking platform the application may extract or attempt to extract the following information name gender birthday and or age current city hometown relationship status sexual orientation primary language employment history education history contact information e.g. mailing address es e mail address es phone number s etc. interests recorded with the electronic social networking platform e.g. by endorsing interest objects manifested as pages check ins registered with the electronic social networking platform event information for events to which the user identity has been invited within the context of the electronic social networking platform status posts published by the user identity to other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network and any related responsive comments and or endorsements and wall posts or timeline posts received by the user identity.

In some situations the application may be unable to extract certain types of information from the electronic social networking platform for a particular user identity. In some cases this may be due to the fact that the particular user identity has not supplied the desired type s of information to the electronic social networking platform. Alternatively the particular user identity may have supplied the desired type s of information to the electronic social networking platform but the application may not be authorized to extract the desired type s of information from the electronic social networking platform for the particular user identity e.g. based on the particular user identity s privacy settings .

Referring first to GUI displays aggregated statistics about various different demographic characteristics of 11 825 335 user identities of the electronic social networking platform based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform by the application for the 11 825 335 user identities.

For example GUI includes a Basic Demographics panel that presents aggregated statistics about the gender relationship status age and education level of the users identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. More particularly the Basic Demographics panel includes a gender sub panel that indicates that the application extracted gender information from the electronic social networking platform for 11 617 221 user identities and that 52 of these user identities were male while 48 were female.

The Basic Demographics panel also includes a relationship status sub panel that indicates that the application extracted relationship status information from the electronic social networking platform for 6 209 791 user identities and that 42 of these user identities were married 34 were single 21 were in a relationship and 4 were engaged.

In addition the Basic Demographics panel includes an age sub panel that indicates that the application extracted birthday or age information from the electronic social networking platform for 5 259 790 user identities and that provides a breakdown by age bracket of these 5 259 790 user identities. It will be understood that the age brackets illustrated in age sub panel may be arbitrary and that the application may use other age brackets instead. Moreover the application actually may enable a user to configure the age brackets to be used within age sub panel .

Finally the Basic Demographics panel includes an education level sub panel that indicates that the application extracted education history information for 8 120 390 user identities and that the highest level of education attended was high school for 23 of these user identities college for 60 of these user identities and graduate school for 17 of these user identities. The application may determine the highest level of education attended for an individual user identity based on the highest level of education for which the user identity specified a school that the user identity attended in the user identity s profile. For example if a user identity specified a high school that the user identity attended but no college or graduate school the application may determine that high school was the highest level of education that the user identity attended. Similarly if a user identity specifies a graduate school that the user identity attended but no high school or college the application may determine that graduate school was the highest level of education that the user identity attended.

GUI also includes a Geographic Profile panel that presents aggregated statistics about the current locations of residence of the user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. More particularly the Geographic Profile panel includes an urbanicity sub panel that indicates that the application was able to map the current locations of residence of 6 298 671 user identities for whom current residence information was extracted from the electronic social networking platform to either urban or rural areas and that of these user identities 80 currently reside in urban areas while 20 currently reside in rural areas. As described in greater detail below the current residence information for user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform may not actually indicate whether the locations of current residence of the user identities are in urban or rural areas. Instead the current residence information for user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform may simply identify the current cities and perhaps states territories and or countries of residence of the user identities. As such the application may employ intelligent mapping techniques to the current cities and perhaps states territories and or countries of residence of the user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform to determine whether the current locations of residence of the user identities are in urban or rural areas. In some cases the application may not be able to determine whether a particular user identity s location of current residence is located in an urban or rural area based on the current residence information extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the particular user identity. In such cases the application may not include data for the particular user identity in the statistics presented in the urbanicity sub panel .

The Geographic Profile panel also includes a metro area sub panel that indicates that the application was able to map the current locations of residence of 6 173 847 user identities for whom current residence information was extracted from the electronic social networking platform to different metro areas and that provides a breakdown of current residence by metro area for these 6 173 847 user identities. As illustrated in the view of metro area sub panel displayed within GUI includes only seven different metro areas accounting for only 20 of the user identities for whom the application was able to map the current residence information extracted from the electronic social networking platform to different metro areas. Therefore GUI is configured to enable a user to scroll the view of metro area sub panel to display metro area information for additional user identities.

As described in greater detail below the current residence information for user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform may not actually indicate metro areas to which the locations of current residence of the user identities belong. Instead the current residence information for user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform may simply identify the current cities and perhaps states territories and or countries of residence of the user identities. As such the application may employ intelligent mapping techniques to the current cities and perhaps states territories and or countries of residence of the user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform to determine whether the current locations of residence of the user identities belong to different metro areas. In some cases the application may determine that a particular user identity s location of current residence does not belong to any metro area based on the current residence information extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the particular user identity. In such cases the application may not include data for the particular user identity in the statistics presented in the metro area sub panel .

The Geographic Profile panel also includes a country sub panel that indicates that the application was able to identify the country of current residence of 7 258 729 user identities for whom current residence information was extracted from the electronic social networking platform and that provides a breakdown of current residence by country for these 7 258 729 user identities. As illustrated in the view of country sub panel displayed within GUI includes only eleven different countries accounting for only 77 of the user identities for whom the application was able to identify the country of current residence based on the current residence information extracted from the electronic social networking platform. Therefore GUI is configured to enable a user to scroll the view of country sub panel to display country information for additional user identities.

As described in greater detail below the current residence information for user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform may not actually indicate the countries of current residence of the user identities. Instead the current residence information for user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform may simply identify the current cities and perhaps states territories of residence of the user identities. As such the application may employ intelligent mapping techniques to the current cities and perhaps states territories of residence of the user identities extracted from the electronic social networking platform to determine the countries of current residence of the user identities. In some cases the application may be unable to identify a country of current residence for a particular user identity based on the current residence information extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the particular user identity. In such cases the application may not include data for the particular user identity in the statistics presented in the country sub panel .

GUI also includes an Estimated Income Profile panel that presents aggregated statistics about the estimated incomes of user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. More particularly the Estimated Income Profile panel indicates that the application was able to generate income estimates for 6 514 443 user identities based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the user identities and presents a breakdown by income bracket for these 6 514 443 user identities. It will be understood that the income brackets illustrated in Estimated Income Profile panel may be arbitrary and that the application may use other income brackets instead. Moreover the application actually may enable a user to configure the income brackets to be used within Estimated Income Profile panel .

As described in greater detail below the electronic social networking platform may not actually maintain estimated income information for user identities of the electronic social networking platform. As such the application may employ intelligent techniques to other data extracted from the electronic social networking platform for user identities such as for example the user identities age employment history education history and current residence to estimate the user identities income. In some cases the application may be unable to estimate a particular user identity s income based on the information extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the particular user identity. In such cases the application may not include data for the particular user identity in the statistics presented in the Estimated Income Profile panel .

GUI also includes a Language Profile panel that presents aggregated statistics about the primary languages of user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. More particularly the Language Profile panel indicates that the application was able to identify primary languages for 11 821 412 of the user identities for whom data was extracted from the electronic social networking platform and presents a breakdown of these 11 821 412 user identities by primary language. As illustrated in the view of Language Profile panel displayed within GUI includes only ten different languages accounting for only 90 of the user identities for whom the application was able to identify primary languages based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform. Therefore GUI is configured to enable a user to scroll the view of Language Profile panel to display primary language information for additional user identities.

Referring now to GUI displays aggregated statistics about various different interests of the 11 825 335 user identities of the electronic social networking platform for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform based on interests that the user identities recorded with the electronic social networking platform for example by endorsing interest objects manifested as pages within the electronic social networking platform.

As illustrated in GUI includes an Affinity panel and a Popularity panel . Affinity panel is described in greater detail below in connection with . Popularity panel meanwhile presents a list of the interests determined to be most popular among the user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. More particularly Popularity panel presents a list of the pages in the electronic social networking platform that were endorsed by the greatest number of user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. As illustrated in the Facebook page is the most popular page among user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform having been endorsed by 820 753 user identities. The remaining pages presented in Popularity panel following the Facebook page are listed in descending order of popularity. The view of Popularity panel displayed within GUI includes only twenty one different pages. Therefore GUI may be configured to enable a user to scroll the view of Popularity panel to display additional pages determined to be popular among the user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform.

As illustrated in GUI also includes a page group filter control and a page category filter control . Individually or in combination the page group filter control and the page category filter control enable a user to specify that the collection of pages from which pages to be presented within GUI are drawn should be filtered to include only some subset of all of the pages endorsed by user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. More particularly the page group filter control and the page category filter control enable a user to specify that the collection of pages from which pages to be presented within GUI are drawn should be filtered according to the types or categories of pages. 

Some electronic social networking platforms may maintain their own taxonomies for categorizing pages or more generally interests . In some implementations the application may retain the categories assigned to pages or interests by the electronic social networking platform. In such implementations the application may enable a user to use page category filter control to specify that the collection of pages from which pages to be presented within GUI are drawn should be filtered to include only pages categorized by the electronic social networking platform as belonging to one or more categories designated by the user.

Additionally or alternatively the application may group the various different categories assigned to pages or interests by the electronic social networking platform into supersets of page or interest types. For example an electronic social networking platform s taxonomy for categorizing pages or interests may include the categories concert venue musician band record label playlist radio station album musical instrument concert tour song music musical genre music chart and music video which the application may group all together into a superset identified as being related to music. In such implementations the application may enable a user to use page group filter control to specify that the collection of pages from which pages to be presented within GUI are drawn should be filtered to include only pages belonging to one or more designated supersets of page types identified by the application.

Referring now to GUI displays aggregated statistics about subsets of the 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform classified as belonging to different psychographic profiles. Generally speaking psychographic profiles may represent one or more particular interests lifestyles values attitudes behaviors and or personality types.

As illustrated in GUI includes a Psychographic Profile panel listing a number of different selectable psychographic profiles including music lovers movie lovers TV fans social activists sports lovers food lovers book lovers travel lovers art connoisseurs health and beauty conscious game lovers techies comedy lovers car lovers brand conscious religious people outdoor enthusiasts frequent travelers do it yourselfers party goers politics Democrats pet lovers brides to be budget shoppers deal hunters politics Republicans and parents of young kids.

In addition for each psychographic profile listed Psychographic Profile panel includes a number of the user identities from among the 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform that the application identified as belonging to the psychographic profile. The Psychographic Profile panel also includes an indication of the percentage of the user identities from among the 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform that the application identified as belonging to each psychographic profile. For example the Psychographic Profile panel indicates that the application identified 1 741 363 user identities from among the 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform as belonging to the music lovers psychographic profile and that this number represents 15 of the 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform. As illustrated in the psychographic profiles included in Psychographic Profile panel are listed in descending order of the number of user identities the application identified as belonging to each psychographic profile.

Given screen real estate constraints the view of Psychographic Profile panel displayed within GUI may not include all of the psychographic profiles to which the application has identified user identities as belonging. Therefore GUI may be configured to enable a user to scroll the view of Psychographic Profile panel to display additional selectable psychographic profiles including for example environmentally aware charity minded shopping lovers beverage lovers and on line shoppers.

As described in greater detail below the electronic social networking platform may not actually classify user identities as belonging to different psychographic profiles. As such the application may employ intelligent techniques to identify user identities as belonging to different psychographic profiles based on data extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the user identities including for example interest objects endorsed by the user identities check ins registered by the user identities and or various different demographic characteristics of the user identities.

GUI also includes a Demographic Panel configured to display aggregated statistics about various different demographic characteristics of the user identities who the application identified as belonging to a psychographic profile selected from the list of psychographic profiles presented in Psychographic Profile panel .

Responsive to selection of a different one of the psychographic profiles included in Psychographic Profile panel GUI updates Demographic Profile panel to present aggregated statistics about the various different demographic characteristics of the user identities whom the application identified as belonging to the newly selected psychographic profile.

Referring now to GUI displays aggregated statistics about measures e.g. scores of the affluence influence and popularity of the 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform derived from various different types of data that the application extracted from the electronic social networking platform. As described in greater detail below the electronic social networking platform may not actually calculate measures of the affluence influence and or popularity of user identities. As such the application may employ intelligent techniques to calculate measures of the affluence influence and or popularity of user identities based on data extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the user identities. Depending upon the data available from the electronic social networking platform for individual user identities the application may be unable to calculate measures of the affluence influence and or popularity of some of the 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform.

As illustrated in GUI includes a Scores Summary Panel that presents an average affluence score of the user identities for whom the application was able to calculate affluence scores an average influence score of the user identities for whom the application was able to calculate influence scores and an average popularity score of the user identities for whom the application was able to calculate popularity scores.

Values for various different characteristics of the user identities for whom the application extracted information from the electronic social networking platform may be plotted as a function of the geographic locations of the user identities using bubble charts overlaying maps.

For example referring now to GUI presents a bubble chart overlaying a map that plots the number of user identities for whom the application extracted current residence information from the electronic social networking platform who currently reside at various different geographic locations. As illustrated in the sizes of the bubbles plotted over geographic locations represent the number of user identities for whom the application extracted current residence information from the electronic social networking platform who currently reside at the locations where larger bubbles represent greater numbers of user identities.

Referring now to GUI presents a bubble chart overlaying a map that plots the average affluence of user identities for whom the application extracted current residence information from the electronic social networking platform and for whom the application was able to calculate measures of affluence as a function of the geographic location of the user identities current residences. As illustrated in the sizes of the bubbles plotted over geographic locations represent the average affluence of user identities for whom the application extracted current residence information from the electronic social networking platform and for whom the application was able to calculate measures of affluence who currently reside at the locations where larger bubbles represent higher levels of average affluence.

Referring now to GUI presents a bubble chart overlaying a map that plots the average influence of user identities for whom the application extracted current residence information from the electronic social networking platform and for whom the application was able to calculate measures of influence as a function of the geographic location of the user identities current residences.

As illustrated in the size of the bubbles plotted over geographic locations represents the average popularity of user identities for whom the application extracted current residence information from the electronic social networking platform and for whom the application was able to calculate measures of popularity who currently reside at the locations where larger bubbles represent higher levels of average popularity.

As discussed above in connection with the GUIs and illustrated in various different characteristics or estimates of various different characteristics of the user identities for whom the application extracted data from the electronic social networking platform may be derived from the data extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the user identities even if the electronic social networking platform itself does not record or make available data about such characteristics. For example the hometown and or current residence information for a user identity returned by the electronic social networking platform may be incomplete providing only an indication of a city but not the state territory and or country in which the city is located and the application may identify the state territory and or country in which the city is located. Additionally or alternatively the application may determine if a user identity s current residence is urban or rural. The application also may determine if a user identity s current residence belongs to a particular metro area. In addition the application may estimate a user identity s income affluence influence and or popularity based on data extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the user identity. Furthermore the application may determine if the user identity belongs to any one of a number of different psychographic profiles based on data extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the user identity.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine the state territory and or country in which a user identity s hometown or current residence is located when the hometown or current residence information for the user identity returned by the electronic social networking platform provides an indication of a city but not the state territory and or country in which the city is located. In some implementations the hometown or current residence information for the user identity returned by the electronic social networking platform may include geographic coordinates corresponding to the user identity s hometown or current residence city. In such implementations the geographic coordinates may be used to identify the location of the city from which the state territory and or country in which the city is located then can be determined. In other implementations the city returned by the electronic social networking platform may be compared to hometown or current residence cities already extracted from the electronic social networking platform for other user identities and if the city matches one of the cities already extracted from the electronic social networking platform for one or more other user identities the state territory and or country information associated with the matched city may be assumed to be the same. In the event that the city returned by the electronic social networking platform matches multiple cities already extracted from the electronic social networking platform located in different states territories and or countries the state territory and or country information associated with the matching city corresponding to the greatest number of other user identities may be assumed to be the state territory and or country to associate with the city.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine if a user identity s current residence is urban or rural. For example a database of geographic locations e.g. identified by one or more of city state territory and or country name latitude longitude or other geographic coordinates etc. known to be urban locations may be maintained. When a user identity s current residence location is extracted from the electronic social networking platform the user identity s current residence location may be compared to the geographic locations known to be urban locations. If the user identity s current residence location matches one of the geographic locations known to be an urban location then the user identity s current residence may be determined to be urban. If the user identity s current residence location does not match any of the geographic locations known to be urban locations one or more databases that store population data for different locations may be accessed. If the population for the user identity s current residence location can be determined by accessing the database s storing population data and the population for the user identity s current residence location is greater than or equal to a defined threshold value e.g. 15 000 then the user identity s current residence may be determined to be urban. If the population for the user identity s current residence location can be determined by accessing the database s storing population data and the population for the user identity s current residence location is less than a defined threshold value e.g. 15 000 then the user identity s current residence may be determined to be rural. If the population for the user identity s current residence location cannot be determined by accessing the database s storing population data the application may be unable to determine if the user identity s current residence location is urban or rural.

Various different techniques may be employed to determine if a user identity s current residence belongs to a particular metro area. For example a database of known metro areas may be maintained. This database may store geographic coordinates for each of the known metro areas. In some implementations these coordinates may correspond to the primary city around which the metro area is centered e.g. the coordinates may be the coordinates for the center of the city around which the metro area is centered . In other implementations these coordinates may correspond to the geographic center of the metro area. In still other implementations these coordinates may correspond to boundaries of the metro area. When a user identity s current residence location is extracted from the electronic social networking platform geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence may be determined. In some implementations geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence may be provided by the electronic social networking platform. In other implementations the electronic social networking platform may return the city state territory and or country name of the user identity s current residence. In such implementations a query may be run against the city state territory and or country name of the user identity s current residence to determine geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence. Once geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence have been determined distances between the geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence and any one or more of the geographic coordinates for the known metro areas may be calculated. If the distance between the geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence and the geographic coordinates for any known metro area is determined to be less than or equal to a defined threshold distance e.g. 60 miles the user identity s current residence may be determined to be a part of that metro area. In the event that the distances between the geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence and the geographic coordinates for multiple metro areas are less than or equal to the defined threshold distance the user identity s current residence may be determined to be a part of the metro area to which it is closest. If the distance between the geographic coordinates for the user identity s current residence and the geographic coordinates for all of the known metro areas is determined to exceed a defined threshold distance e.g. 60 miles the user identity s current residence may be determined to not be a part of any metro area.

Various different techniques may be employed to estimate a user identity s income based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform. One particular example is described below.

First a determination may be made as to whether the user identity likely has an income. This determination may be made based upon one or more of the user identity s age employment history and education history. If the user identity has a current employer specified in his her employment history the user identity may be determined to have an income irrespective of the user identity s age and or education history. If the user identity is less than 18 years old and does not have a current employer specified in his her employment history the user identity may be determined not to have an income. If the user identity is between 18 years old and 21 years old does not have a current employer specified in his her employment history and does not have a college university or a graduate school specified in his her employment history the user identity may be determined to have an income. In contrast if the user identity is between 18 years old and 21 years old does not have a current employer specified in his her employment history and does have a college university or a graduate school specified in his her employment history the user identity may be determined not to have an income. If the user identity is between 22 years old and 25 years old does not have a current employer specified in his her employment history and does not have a graduate school specified in his her employment history the user identity may be determined to have an income. In contrast if the user identity is between 22 years old and 25 years old does not have a current employer specified in his her employment history and does have a graduate school specified in his her employment history the user identity may be determined to not have an income. If the user identity is between 25 years old and 65 years old and does not have a current employer specified in his her employment history the user identity still may be determined to have an income. If the user identity is more than 65 years old and does not have a current employer specified in his her employment history the user identity may be determined not to have an income. Finally if no age information is returned from the electronic social networking platform for the user identity the application may not be able to estimate the user identity s income.

If the user identity is determined to have an income a base income then is determined for the user identity. Different techniques may be employed to determine a base income for the user identity. For example one or more databases may be maintained that store base incomes to be used for user identities based on the current residence locations of the user identities. In some implementations the same base income may be used for all user identities within a single country. In such implementations the base income to be used for user identities from each country may be the mean or median income for the country. In other implementations different base incomes may be used for user identities from a single country. In such implementations the base incomes to be used may vary at the regional state or even city level and may be based on the mean or median incomes for the corresponding regions states or cities. For example the base incomes to be used for user identities residing in one country may be determined based on the cities in the country where the user identities currently reside. More particularly the base income to be used for a user identity may be the mean income for individuals in the user identity s current residence city. Alternatively the base income to be used for a user identity may be the median income for individuals in the user identity s current residence city.

After determining the base income for the user identity age and education level multipliers then are determined for the user identity. The age multiplier for the user identity may be calculated according to Equation 1 below 

Meanwhile the education level multiplier for the user identity depends on the user identity s education history. If the user identity s age is less than 22 years old the user identity s education level multiplier may be calculated according to Equation 2 below. Similarly if the user identity s education history specifies a high school but no college university or graduate school the user identity s education level multiplier may be calculated according to Equation 2 below 

If the user identity s education history specifies a college university but no graduate school and the user identity is at least 22 years old or no age is specified for the user identity the user identity s education multiplier may be calculated according to Equation 3 below. Similarly if the user identity s education history specifies a graduate school and the user identity is less than 25 years old the user identity s education level multiplier may be calculated according to Equation 3 below 

If the user identity s education history specifies a graduate school and the user identity is at least 25 years old the user identity s education level multiplier may be calculated according to Equation 4 below 

The education level multiplier for a user identity who does not satisfy any of the above conditions is 1. 

After the age and education level multipliers for the user identity have been determined the user s estimated income is determined according to Equation 5 below est. income base income age multipler education level multiplier Eq. 5 

Various different techniques may be employed to estimate a user identity s affluence based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform. In one example an affluence score for a user identity may be determined for the user identity based on the income estimated for the user identity for example as described above. More particularly the affluence score for the user identity may be calculated by dividing the estimated income for the user identity by the highest estimated income for all user identities for which the application is able to calculate an estimated income and then multiplying the result by 100.

Various different techniques may be employed to estimate a user identity s influence based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform. One particular example is described below.

In this example an influence score may be calculated for a user identity based on the user identity s activity within the electronic social networking platform over a defined period of time e.g. the previous 30 days the previous 60 days the previous 90 days the previous year etc. . First the number of status posts M that the user identity has published within the electronic social networking platform during the defined period of time is determined. In addition the number of distinct users who endorsed each of the M posts is determined and the number of distinct users who commented on each of the M posts is determined. A raw influence score for the user identity then may be calculated according to Equation 6 below raw influence square root over distinct users endorsing post 3 distinct users commenting on post Eq. 6 

A final influence score for the user identity then is calculated for the user identity by converting the user identity s raw influence score to a logarithmic scale and dividing by a maximum cut off value so that the user identity s final influence score is within the range 0 99 according to Equation 7 below 

Various different techniques may be employed to estimate a user identity s popularity based on information extracted from the electronic social networking platform. One particular example is described below.

In this example a popularity score may be calculated for a user identity based on targeted wall or timeline posts from other user identities wall or timeline posts from gaming applications and or event invitations that the user identity received within the electronic social networking platform over a defined period of time e.g. the previous 30 days the previous 60 days the previous 90 days the previous year etc. .

First the wall or timelines posts from other user identities the wall or timelines posts from gaming applications and the event invitations that the user received within the electronic social networking platform during the defined time period are identified. In addition the sources of each of the identified wall or timeline posts from other user identities the wall or timeline posts from gaming applications and the event invitations are identified. Then for each identified source i of wall or timelines posts from other user identities wall or timeline posts from gaming applications and event invitations a weighted score is calculated according to Equation 8 below posts posted 0.1 of gaming posts 2 quality event invites sent Eq. 8 where of posts posted represents the number of wall or timeline posts from a user identity that originated from the source i of gaming posts represents the number of wall or timeline posts from gaming applications that originated from the source i and quality event invites sent represents the number of event invitations for which more than a defined threshold of invitees have accepted an invitation that originated from the source i.

After the score nhas been calculated for each source i a sum of the scores nfor all M sources may be calculated according to Equation 9 below Eq. 9 

A final popularity score for the user identity then is calculated for the user identity by converting the user identity s raw popularity score to a logarithmic scale and dividing by a maximum cut off value so that the user identity s final popularity score is within the range 0 99 according to Equation 11 below 

As discussed above the application may determine if user identities for whom the application extracted data from the electronic social networking platform belong to one or more different psychographic profiles based on the data for the user identities that the application extracted for the user identities from the electronic social networking platform. A variety of different techniques may be used to determine if a user identity belongs to a particular psychographic profile and the application may consider a variety of different types of data extracted for the user identity from the electronic social networking platform in determining if the user identity belongs to the particular psychographic profile. For example the application may consider the user identity s page endorsements check ins and or demographic characteristics when determining if the user identity belongs to a particular psychographic profile.

Each psychographic profile may be defined as corresponding to a collection of certain pages within the electronic social networking platform. The collection of pages corresponding to any particular psychographic profile may be identified based on pages that have been specifically designated within the application e.g. pages that have been hardcoded within the application as belonging to the psychographic profile pages that have been assigned one or more category designations within the electronic social networking platform and or pages that include one or more specified keywords within the text of their page descriptions within the electronic social networking platform.

The application may determine if a user identity belongs to a particular psychographic profile based on the extent to which the user identity has endorsed pages that the application identities as corresponding to the particular psychographic profile. The application may consider any user identity who has endorsed at least one page that corresponds to the particular psychographic profile as a candidate for the psychographic profile. For a user identity that the application has identified as a candidate for a particular psychographic profile the application then may calculate a psychographic profile page score for the user identity according to Equation 12 below psychographic profile page score Eq. 12 where A represents the number of pages that the user identity has endorsed that correspond to the particular psychographic profile and B represents the total number of pages that the user identity has endorsed within the electronic social networking platform. As described in greater detail below the application then may use the psychographic profile page score calculated for the user identity in determining if the user identity belongs to the particular psychographic profile.

Another factor the application may consider in determining whether a user identity belongs to a particular psychographic profile is the user identity s check ins that the application extracted from the electronic social networking platform. Each psychographic profile may be defined as corresponding to a collection of certain check in locations. The collection of check in locations corresponding to any particular psychographic profile may be identified based on check in locations that have been assigned one or more category designations within the electronic social networking platform and or check in locations that have been assigned one or more category designations by the application e.g. specific check in locations that have been hardcoded as belonging to one or more different categories by the application itself . The application may determine if a user identity belongs to a particular psychographic profile based on the extent to which the user identity has checked in at locations that the application identifies as corresponding to the particular psychographic profile.

The application also has updated the aggregated statistics about the various different demographic characteristics presented in Basic Demographics panel the Geographic Profile panel the Estimated Income Profile panel and the Language Profile panel of GUI to reflect the demographic characteristics of the 19 741 user identities that the application identified as belonging to the segment.

Presenting the aggregated statistics about the various different demographic characteristics of the user identities identified as belonging to the segment for example as illustrated in may enable a representative of the application to assess whether the segment actually includes the types of user identities that the representative desires to target or whether additional or alternative filtering may aid in better defining a segment of user identities the representative desires to target.

Referring now to the application also has updated the aggregated interest statistics presented in Affinity panel and Popularity panel of GUI to reflect interests that the 19 741 user identities that the application identified as belonging to the segment have recorded with the electronic social networking platform for example by endorsing interest objects manifested as pages within the electronic social networking platform. As discussed above Popularity panel presents a list of the interests determined to be most popular among the user identities that the application identified as belonging to the segment. Affinity panel meanwhile presents a list of interests that user identities that the application identified as belonging to the segment have demonstrated stronger interest in than the overall population of 11 825 335 user identities for whom the application extracted data from the electronic social networking platform.

Identifying interests of the user identities who belong to the segment for example as illustrated in may facilitate the identification of content that may be relevant attractive or appealing to the user identities who belong to the segment. As such identifying interests of the user identities who belong to the segment may assist the application in selecting relevant attractive or appealing content to deliver to user identities identified as belonging to the segment in an automated fashion. For example in response to recognizing that the television show Mad Men is significantly more popular among user identities who belong to the defined segment than it is among the overall population of user identities for whom the application extracted data from the electronic social networking platform the application may identify content accessible to the application that has been tagged as being related to the television show Mad Men and deliver the so identified content to user identities identified as belonging to the defined segment in an automated fashion e.g. by transmitting the content to user devices associated with the user identities identified as belonging to the defined segment over a network . Additionally or alternatively presenting interests of the user identities who belong to the segment for example as illustrated in may assist a representative of the application in creating content to be targeted to user identities who belong to the segment. For example if the representative of the application is interested in conducting a marketing campaign that targets user identities who belong to the segment the representative may decide to incorporate a Mad Men theme within the marketing campaign in an effort to appeal to the user identities identified as belonging to the segment.

Referring now to the application has updated the membership of the different psychographic profiles represented in GUI to include only user identities that the application identified as belonging to the segment. In addition the application has updated the aggregated statistics presented about each of the different psychographic profiles in GUI to reflect the characteristics of the user identities that belong to the segment that the application identified as belonging to the different psychographic profiles.

Information about the psychographic profiles of the user identities who belong to the segment may facilitate the identification of content that may be relevant attractive or appealing to the user identities who belong to the segment. As such uncovering information about the psychographic profiles of the user identities who belong to the segment may assist the application in selecting relevant attractive or appealing content to deliver to user identities identified as belonging to the segment in an automated fashion. Additionally or alternatively presenting information about the psychographic profiles of the user identities who belong to the segment for example as illustrated in may assist a representative of the application in creating content to be targeted to user identities who belong to the segment.

Referring now to the application has updated Scores Summary Panel to present an average affluence score of the user identities within the segment for whom the application was able to calculate affluence scores an average influence score of the user identities within the segment for whom the application was able to calculate influence scores and an average popularity score of the user identities within the segment for whom the application was able to calculate popularity scores.

Presenting statistics about the affluence influence and or popularity of the user identities identified as belonging to the segment for example as illustrated in may enable a representative of the application to assess whether the segment actually includes the types of user identities that the representative desires to target or whether additional or alternative filtering may aid in better defining a segment of user identities the representative desires to target.

Referring now to the application has updated the bubble chart of GUI to plot the number of user identities within the segment who currently reside at various different geographic locations. Similarly referring now to the application has updated the bubble chart of GUI to plot the average affluence of user identities within the segment for whom the application was able to calculate measures of affluence as a function of the geographic location of the user identities current residence. Likewise referring now to the application has updated the bubble chart of GUI to plot the average influence of user identities within the segment for whom the application was able to calculate measures of influence as a function of the geographic location of the user identities current residence. Finally referring now to the application has updated the bubble chart of GUI to plot the average popularity of user identities within the segment for whom the application was able to calculate measures of popularity as a function of the geographic location of the user identities current residence.

Plotting various different characteristics of the user identities identified as belonging to the defined segment as a function of the geographic location of their current residences for example as illustrated in may facilitate the identification of geographic locations around which user identities identified as belonging to the segment and or user identities identified as belonging to the segment who possess certain other characteristics are concentrated. This information may be useful in selecting geographic regions within which to focus outreach efforts directed at user identities identified as belonging to the segment or other individuals who may share characteristics in common with the user identities identified as belonging to the segment.

In addition to or as an alternative to enabling analysis of different characteristics of user identities identified as belonging to a segment after the segment of user identities has been defined for example as illustrated and described above in connection with the application also may enable targeted content to be directed to the user identities identified as belonging to the defined segment.

Referring now to examples of techniques and systems for targeting content to segments of user identities identified by the application hosted by computing system are now described.

As illustrated in computing system may maintain one or more data stores for example in the internal or external storage components accessible to computing system that store data extracted from electronic social networking platform . In addition computing system also may maintain one or more data stores for example in the internal or external storage components accessible to computing system that store content that is to be delivered to users of the application hosted by computing system . For illustrative purposes data store s and data store s are represented as separate entities. However data store s and data store s may be integrated or otherwise implemented as a single data store either on a single computing device or distributed across several computing devices.

In some implementations a representative of the application hosted by computing system may define content to be delivered to users of the application for example using computing device . The application hosted by computing system may store this content in data store from which the application may deliver the content to one or more users of the application for example by transmitting the content to computing devices associated with users of the application over network .

Computing devices may be any of a number of different types of computing devices including for example tablet computers as illustrated in or mobile phones smartphones personal digital assistants laptop or netbook computers or desktop computers. Furthermore computing devices typically may have internal or external storage components for storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. In particular the internal or external storage components for computing devices may store client applications for interfacing with electronic social networking platform and or client applications for interfacing with computing system . Additionally or alternatively computing devices may be configured to interface with electronic social networking platform or computing system without specific client applications using for example web browsers. As such user identities of electronic social networking platform may be able to use computing devices to access electronic social networking platform . Similarly users of the application hosted by computing system may be able to use computing devices to access the application hosted by computing system .

The application hosted by computing system may enable a representative of the application to specify that certain content stored in data store is to be delivered to all users of the application while other content stored in data store is only to be delivered to specific segments of users of the application defined for example according to techniques described above.

For example the application hosted by computing system may maintain one or more content item tables e.g. in data store that record among other things indications of content items to be delivered by the application to users of the application as well as indications of the users to whom each content item is to be delivered. The indications of content items recorded in the content item table s may serve as pointers to specific content items for example stored in data store . Meanwhile in some implementations the indications of the users to whom content items are to be delivered may be recorded in the content item table s as indications of defined segments of users. For example each defined segment of users may be associated with a segment ID and the indications of the segments of users to whom content items are to be delivered may be recorded in the content item table s as the segment IDs that correspond to the segments of users to whom the content items are to be delivered. The segment ID recorded in the content item table s for a content item that is to be delivered to all users of the application may correspond to a segment that includes all users of the application. Alternatively another value may be recorded in the content item table s in place of a segment ID for a content item that is to be delivered to all users of the application to reflect that the content item is to be delivered to all users of the application. Meanwhile the segment ID recorded in the content item table s for a content item that is to be delivered to a particular segment of users may correspond to the specific segment of users to whom the content item is targeted.

In addition to the one or more content item tables the application hosted by computing system may maintain one or more user segment tables that record among other things the users who belong to each segment. When a new segment of users is defined e.g. according to the techniques described above the application may identify the users who belong to the new segment and store indications of the users e.g. user IDs who belong to the new segment in the user segment table s . In some implementations the user segment table s may include a segment column and a user column such that each row in the user segment table s identifies a particular segment e.g. by segment ID in the segment column and specifies a particular user e.g. by user ID in the user column who previously was identified as belonging to the particular segment. In such implementations a user who belongs to multiple different segments may be represented in multiple rows within the user segment table s e.g. one row for each segment to which the user belongs . The application hosted by computing system may determine to which users to deliver a particular content item stored in data store by identifying the segment to which the particular content item is to be delivered from the content item table s and by identifying which users belong to the identified segment from the user segment table s .

In addition to recording indications of the segments to which content items are to be delivered the content item table s also may record other attributes of the content items. For example in some implementations the content item table s may record a content available start time and or a content available end time for a content item. In such implementations the content available start time may specify a starting time at which the content item should be made available to the users to whom it is targeted. Similarly the content available end time may specify an ending time after which the content item no longer should be made available to the users to whom it is targeted.

When a particular user is logged into the application hosted by computing system from a computing device the application may identify the particular user identity e.g. based on user identifying information like a user ID transmitted to the application by the computing device and then identify content stored in data store to deliver to the user identity. In some implementations the application may identify and deliver content stored in data store to the user identity in response to a request from the computing device from which the user is logged into the application. For example the user may be logged into the application via a client application or web browser on the computing device and the client application or web browser on the computing device may generate and transmit a request for content to the application for example in response to user interaction with the client application or web browser on the computing device . In other implementations the application may identify and deliver content stored in data store in response to one or more other triggering conditions. For example the application may identify and push content stored in data store to the computing device without necessarily having received an explicit request for content from computing device .

To identify content to deliver to the computing device from which a particular user is logged into the application hosted by computing system the application may query or otherwise access the user segment table s to identify user segments to which the particular user belongs. In addition the application may query or otherwise access the content item table s to identify content items that have been tagged for delivery to any segment s to which the particular user belongs. The particular user may belong to multiple different segments. Consequently the application may determine that different content items that have been tagged for delivery to different segments of users are to be delivered to the computing device from which the particular user is logged into the application. In addition certain content items stored in data store may be tagged in the content item table s as content items that are to be delivered to all users of the application. Consequently in addition to or as an alternative to identifying for delivery to the particular user content items that have been tagged for delivery to specific segments to which the particular user belongs the application also may identify for delivery to the particular user content items that have been tagged for delivery to all users of the application.

As described above in some implementations the content item table s may record a content available start time and or a content available end time for different content items. In such implementations as part of identifying content to deliver to the computing device from which the particular user is logged into the application hosted by computing system the application may compare the current time to any content available start times and or content available end times recorded in connection with content items tagged for delivery to segments to which the particular user belongs before determining to deliver the content items to the computing device from which the particular user identity is logged into the application. If the content available start time for a content item tagged for delivery to a segment to which the particular user belongs has not yet occurred the application may determine not to identify the content item as a content item to be delivered to the computing device from which the particular user is logged into the application. Likewise if the content available end time for a content item tagged for delivery to a segment to which the particular user belongs already has passed the application may determine not to identify the content item as a content item to be delivered to the computing device from which the particular user is logged into the application.

After identifying content items to deliver to the computing device from which the user is logged into the application the application may access one or more of the identified content items from data store and transmit the accessed content item s to the user device from which the user is logged into the application e.g. via network . As a result of identifying content items that are specifically targeted to segments to which the particular user belongs for delivery to the computing device from which the particular user is logged into the application the application may deliver content to the computing device from which the particular user is logged into the application that is particularly relevant attractive or appealing to the particular user.

Furthermore the content delivered by the application to different users logged into the application from different computing devices may be different e.g. even if the users are logged into the application at substantially the same time . For example the content delivered by the application to a first user logged into the application from computing device may be different from the content delivered by the application to a second user logged into the application from computing device and the content delivered to the first and second users may be different from the content delivered by the application to a third user logged into the application from computing device . In particular content delivered by the application to the first user logged into the application from computing device may include content items specifically targeted to segments to which the first user belongs while content delivered by the application to the second user logged into the application from computing device may include content items specifically targeted to segments to which the second user belongs and content delivered by the application to the third user logged into the application from computing device may include content items specifically targeted to segments to which the third user belongs.

Referring again to a specific example is illustrated of how content delivered by the application to different users logged into the application from different computing devices may be different even if the users are logged into the application at substantially the same time. As discussed above the user identity James logged into the application from mobile device currently resides in New York City speaks English as his primary language and is interested in business intelligence software while the user identity Jacques logged into the application from mobile device currently resides in Montreal speaks French as his primary language and is interested in business intelligence software. Consequently content delivered by the application to the user identity James at mobile device including for example invitation may be targeted to a segment of users that is defined as including users who live in the New York City metro area who speak English as their primary language and who are interested in business intelligence software and that thus includes James. Meanwhile content delivered by the application to the user identity Jacques at mobile device including for example invitation may be targeted to a segment of users that is defined as including users who live in the Montreal metro area who speak French as their primary language and who are interested in business intelligence software and that thus includes Jacques.

The computing system extracts data associated with user identities within an electronic social networking platform from the electronic social networking platform . For example for each user identity within a set of user identities the computing system may extract or attempt to extract from the electronic social networking platform some or all of the following types of data name gender birthday and or age current city hometown relationship status sexual orientation primary language employment history education history contact information e.g. mailing address es e mail address es phone number s etc. interests recorded with the electronic social networking platform e.g. by endorsing interest objects manifested as pages check ins registered with the electronic social networking platform event information for events to which the user identity has been invited within the context of the electronic social networking platform status posts published by the user identity to other user identities who are members of the user identity s social network and any related responsive comments and or endorsements and wall posts or timeline posts received by the user identity. After extracting the data from the electronic social networking platform the computing system may store the extracted data in a computer readable storage device.

The computing system receives a request to filter the user identities for whom data was extracted from the electronic social networking platform based on a specified value for a characteristic . The computing system may receive the request to filter the user identities from a computing device associated with a representative of the application hosted by the computing system. For example the computing system may receive the request to filter the user identities from computing device of and . The computing system may provide a variety of different options for filtering the user identities for whom data was extracted from the electronic social networking platform. For example the computing system may enable filtering of the user identities for whom data was extracted based on interests recorded with the electronic social networking platform age relationship status education level income urbanicity of current residence country of current residence state territory of current residence metro area of current residence country of origin primary language psychographic profile membership affluence influence and or popularity. The request to filter the user identities based on a specified value may include a request to filter the user identities based on one or more specified values for any one or more of the different characteristics for which the computing system enables filtering of the user identities for whom data was extracted from the electronic social networking platform.

In response to receiving the request to filter the user identities for whom data was extracted from the electronic social networking platform the computing system identifies a subset of the user identities who have the value for the characteristic specified in the request . In the event that the request includes a request to filter the user identities based on more than one specified value for a characteristic and or one or more values for multiple different characteristics the computing system may identify a subset of user identities who satisfy the different filter parameters specified in the request.

The computing system receives an indication of content to be delivered to the identified subset of user identities . The computing system may receive the indication of content to be delivered to the identified subset of user identities from a computing device associated with a representative of the application hosted by the computing system. For example the computing system may receive the indication of content to be delivered to the identified subset of user identities from computing device of and . The indication of content to be delivered to the identified subset of user identities may include the actual content to be delivered. Alternatively the indication of content to be delivered may include a pointer or other form of a link to the content to be delivered.

Thereafter the computing system delivers the content to at least some of the user identities within the subset of user identities . For example the computing system may deliver the content to a user identity within the subset of user identities according to the process illustrated and described below in connection with . Although not illustrated in at some later time the computing system also may receive one or more indications of additional content to be delivered to the identified subset of user identities and in response the computing system may deliver this additional content to at least some of the user identities within the subset of user identities.

The process illustrated in the flowchart of may be repeated to define multiple different subsets of user identities of the social networking platform who share one or more characteristics and to target content for delivery to each of the different subsets of user identities. The user identities who belong to individual ones of these subsets may overlap. Likewise the user identities who belong to individual ones of these subsets may be disjoint.

The computing system stores indications of user identities who belong to different subsets of user identities of an electronic social networking platform for whom data is extracted from the electronic social networking platform . For example the user identities of the electronic social networking platform for whom data is extracted from the electronic social networking platform may be users of an application hosted by the computing system and the different subsets of the user identities for whom data is extracted from the electronic social networking platform may be defined according to techniques described above. In some implementations the computing system may store the indications of the user identities who belong to the different subsets in one or more tables that record the individual user identities who belong to each subset.

The computing system also stores indications of content to be delivered to the different subsets of user identities . The computing system may have received the stored indications of content to be delivered to the different subsets of user identities from one or more computing devices associated with one or more representatives of the application hosted by the computing system. For example the computing system may have received the stored indications of content to be delivered to the different subsets of user identities from computing device of and . The stored indications of the content to be delivered to the different subsets may include pointers or other forms of links to the content to be delivered to the different subsets or the stored indications of the content to be delivered to the different subsets may include the actual content itself.

In addition the computing system stores associations between the indications of content to be delivered to the different subsets of user identities and the indications of the user identities who belong to the corresponding subsets to which the content is to be delivered . For example in some implementations the computing system may store indications of content items to be delivered to the different subsets of user identities in one or more tables and the one or more tables may record the subsets of user identities to which each content item is to be delivered.

The computing system receives a request for content that includes an indication of a particular user identity . For example the computing system may receive a request for content from a computing device such as for example one of computing device of and computing devices of . The request for content may include an indication of a particular user identity on behalf of whom the request is being made. For example the request may include an indication of a user identity e.g. a user ID who is logged into the application hosted by the computing system from the computing device from which the request was received. Furthermore the request may actually be a request by the computing device to establish a communication session that is associated with the particular user identity with the computing system and the request may include identifying information for the particular user identity including for example a user ID and or additional authentication information such as a password or other access control mechanism. Additionally or alternatively the request may be received within an established communication session that is associated with the particular user identity.

The computing system determines that the particular user identity belongs to at least a particular one of the subsets of user identities . For example the computing system may determine that the particular user identity belongs to a particular one of the subsets by querying or otherwise accessing the stored indications of the user identities who belong to the different subsets of user identities. It will be appreciated that the particular user identity may belong to any number of different subsets of user identities.

In addition the computing system identifies content to deliver to the particular user identity based on the stored indications of content to be delivered to the different subsets of user identities the stored indications of the user identities who belong to the different subsets and the stored associations between the indications of the content to be delivered to the different subsets of user identities and the stored indications of the user identities who belong to the different subsets . For example the computing system may identify content to be delivered to at least the particular one of the subsets of user identities as content to deliver to the particular user identity. Furthermore if the computing system determines that the particular user identity belongs to multiple different subsets of user identities the computing system may identify content associated with multiple different subsets of user identities as content to deliver to the particular user identity.

After identifying the content to be delivered to the particular user identity the computing system delivers the content to the particular user identity . For example the computing system may deliver the content to the particular user identity by transmitting the content to a computing device from which the particular user identity is logged into the application hosted by the computing system.

The process illustrated in the flowchart of may be repeated at different times for the same user identity to identify and deliver potentially different content to the user identity. Furthermore the process illustrated in the flowchart of may be repeated to identify and deliver content to multiple different user identities who are users of the application hosted by the computing system. Each user identity for whom the process is performed may belong to different subsets of user identities and thus the content delivered to each user identity for whom the process is performed may be different.

A number of methods techniques systems and apparatuses have been described. Nevertheless various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of this disclosure. For example although various disclosed techniques generally are described herein as being performed externally to an electronic social networking platform using data extracted from the electronic social networking platform in some implementations the techniques disclosed herein may be performed internally within an electronic social networking platform using data stored by the electronic social networking platform. In addition although one mechanism by which a user identity may record an interest with an electronic social networking platform that is described herein is to endorse a page hosted by the electronic social networking platform there are other ways in which a user identity may record an interest with an electronic social networking platform. Furthermore in some cases a user identity may record an interest with an electronic social networking platform by endorsing a page that is not hosted by the electronic social networking platform.

Additionally or alternatively in some implementations the application may extract various different types of contact information for the particular user identity from the electronic social networking platform including for example one or more e mail addresses for the particular user identity and or one or more telephone numbers for the particular user identity. In such implementations the application may transmit targeted content to the particular user identity by sending the targeted content to the e mail address es extracted from the electronic social networking platform for the particular user identity and or by sending the targeted content to the telephone number s for the particular user identity for example as text e.g. short message service SMS and or multimedia e.g. multimedia messaging service MMS messages.

Content distributed to users may include any data that can be provided over an electronic communications network.
