At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to selection and or arrangement of content for presentation to a user. In one specific embodiment the content is an exercise video playlist that a person can follow on a computing device e.g. an Apple iPad device .

Exercise helps to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Many individuals want to participate in an exercise program. A successful exercise program is typically tailored to a fitness level of an individual and aimed at assisting the individual to achieve one or more specific fitness or exercise goals.

Sports trainers are available to assist individuals in developing exercise programs appropriate for their individual fitness levels and their specific fitness or exercise goals. Hiring such professionals however can be expensive. Furthermore the busy schedules of many individuals make it difficult for these individuals to set aside time to meet with a fitness professional on a regular basis. Thus many individuals fail to use the services of fitness professionals and never achieve the benefits that can be obtained from an exercise program tailored for example to one s fitness level or areas of exercise interest.

Systems and methods to select and or arrange content for presentation to a user are described herein. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.

In one embodiment a method implemented in a data processing system includes receiving by a computing device user defined parameters e.g. type of exercise program and time length generating by the computing device a playlist comprising a plurality of content portions e.g. video clips the generating comprising selecting the plurality of content portions from a data repository based on the user defined parameters and further based on meta data for content e.g. meta tags associated with numerous different video clips stored in the data repository and providing by the computing device the playlist for display on a user device.

The disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform these methods including data processing systems which perform these methods and computer readable media containing instructions which when executed on data processing systems cause the systems to perform these methods.

Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.

The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However in certain instances well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one.

Reference in this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.

In one embodiment a video playlist is generated using an fitness application executing on an iPad an exemplary application is identified as FitMix herein merely for illustration . The fitness application dynamically generates a workout video based on user inputs. Within the application a user defines parameters such as for example the desired time length of workout e.g. total minutes workout equipment that is desired for use or available to the user and a preferred fitness instructor s i.e. the instructor leading a given video clip .

In one embodiment using software logic the fitness application selects distinct exercise video clips e.g. approximately 30 90 seconds each from a video clip database and arranges the clips into a playlist. The playlist of video clips is then displayed to the user as a seamless full length workout video that complies with the user defined parameters.

In one embodiment the fitness application generates a wide variety and number of user customized workout videos e.g. many permutations of video clips may be generated . Typically the user will rarely see the same identical workout video again as each video will have some variation. A number of factors promote this high degree of variability the use of user defined parameters the randomization of clip selection and order and the size of the clip database note that new video clips can be continually added to the database . Also the playlist of videos that is generated for a user can be saved and shared by that user with yet other users e.g. members of an online social network site or other forms of sharing .

In one embodiment a system to generate exercise videos or other forms of content in alternative implementations consists of a database that stores video clips with associated meta tags software logic that selects clips from the database and arranges them in an order for presentation play to a user and a video player that displays the playlist of clips as a seamless video to the user on a user device e.g. iPad . The meta tags are descriptors of key attributes of the individual video clips. In an exercise implementation the meta tags may include for example gender of the instructor number of calories burned doing an exercise muscle groups that are worked by an exercise etc. The interface presented to the user of the application permits the user to specify values or ranges for these different attributes. For instance using a graphical slider an end user may specify an upper and lower value for the number of calories that the user wants the playlist of videos to burn. For example after a user has entered all of the user s preferences or requirements all matching video clips are pulled from the database. If there are not enough matching videos to the user s requirements the user is prompted to broaden the requirements. If there are more video clips than are needed a secondary mechanism may be used to select which clips are chosen for the playlist. These secondary mechanism attributes may for example favor the most popular videos in the selection the newest videos or ones that the user has never seen before.

Additional features can be added to this system such as the ability to save and share workout videos. The system can support applications on a wide range of user devices e.g. smart phones tablets PCs and smart TVs .

The server is connected to a data repository to store for example video clips in a video database and user parameter data . Each user terminal may request that server generate one or more video playlists. For example user terminal includes video player that can be used to play video playlist . Video player may be for example a software application downloaded from an online marketplace such as Apple iTunes or Google Play. Video player may be incorporated as part of this downloaded application and video playlist may have been previously generated by and received from server . User terminal may be for example an Apple iPad or a mobile device based on the Android operating system.

In one embodiment as discussed in more detail below a software application on user terminal is used by a user to provide user parameter data to server . Parameter data includes parameters for a video playlist that the user desires to generate. Server includes content engine which uses user parameter data and other software logic as discussed below to generate a video playlist using one or more video clips obtained from video database note that other data sources may be used instead of or in addition to data repository . The software logic may be contained within software of content engine . In one example the video playlist is an exercise video that provides the user with a fitness workout or other exercise regimen. However in other embodiments the playlist may present videos or other content for activities other than exercise.

In one embodiment video database stores both video clips and meta data. Specifically in this embodiment the meta data consists of meta tags associated with each of the video clips. The meta tags can be basic e.g. length title etc. or application specific e.g. fitness instructor workout equipment used calories burned body part exercised intensity etc. . For example the video clips may be obtained from third party sources and or from users such as fitness professionals that provide video clips for storage in video database . The meta tags may have been previously associated with the video clips by the provider of the video clips and or the meta tags may be associated by the operator of server .

Although illustrates an example system implemented in client server architecture embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various alternative architectures. For example the server can be implemented via a peer to peer network of user terminals where the video playlists are shared via peer to peer communication connections. For example content engines may be implemented in the individual user terminals instead of running on one or more centralized servers.

In one alternative embodiment the software application downloaded to user terminal may be used to locally generate the video playlist using a video database stored on or otherwise accessed locally by user terminal . Server is not involved in this local playlist generation. However locally generated playlist may still be sent to server for storage and potential sharing with others such as social network friends of the user.

In some embodiments a combination of client server architecture and peer to peer architecture can be used in which one or more centralized servers may be used to provide some of the information and or services and the peer to peer network is used to provide other information and or services. Thus embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to a particular architecture.

More specifically a graphical user interface GUI of this application as illustrated in permits a user to choose parameters that will be used to dynamically generate for example workout video playlist . These parameters form part or all of the user parameter data discussed above.

In the user uses a window or region of the displayed screen to manually select exercise equipment that the user desires for use during exercise. This equipment may be for example a mat an exercise ball and or dumbbells. The user also uses a window or region to specify one or more desired trainers to appear in some or all of the generated playlist . Also the user specifies the desired total duration or time length of the new playlist using an entry field . The information provided in windows and along with entry field form part of the user parameter data .

After the user has provided parameters for the desired video playlist the user initiates the playlist generation process by touching clicking or otherwise activating a user icon . Alternatively the user may activate a link to generate the playlist. Link provides the user access to an online store where the user may view share and or purchase video playlists created by the user or other persons or entities.

After activation by the user video player displays the playlist of clips generated by the software logic as a seamless video. The application may also display supplementary information such as the remaining time the exercise title the upcoming exercise in the next video clip in sequence to be played etc.

More specifically in block user defined parameters are received from a user via a user interface of a user terminal. These parameters may form some or all of user parameter data to be transmitted to server or such data may be used only for local processing.

In block video clips are selected from a database based on the user defined parameters and further based on meta data for video clips stored in the database. This metadata may consist of or include the associated meta tags discussed above.

In block the selected video clips are arranged into a playlist for providing to the user. In block if the playlist is generated at a server the playlist is transmitted to a user terminal. In block the generated playlist is displayed to the user on a display of a user terminal .

In one embodiment the software logic that implements the method of takes user defined inputs as parameters selects appropriate video clips from the database and arranges the clips into an ordered playlist. The logic uses meta tags stored in the database to filter select and arrange these video clips.

In this embodiment three primary processes are implemented by the software logic as discussed below. The first primary process implements a filter based on the user defined parameters. More specifically this process simply filters video database to provide a filtered dataset that meets certain of the user defined parameters. Only some of the user defined parameters are considered in this filtering process. For example in the software application downloaded to user device parameters such as fitness instructor and available exercise equipment serve as filters in this process whereas the parameter desired playlist time duration does not. Additional parameters used in this filtering may include for example intensity level etc.

The next two primary processes act on the filtered dataset obtained from the first primary process discussed immediately above. The second primary process implements a playlist structure and distribution of video clips. This second process determines the underlying structure of the playlist and considers the user defined time duration parameter e.g. as provided in entry field of along with the associated meta tags for the video clips in database . The underlying structure of the playlist is defined by the percentage distribution of video clips from an arbitrary set of meta tags. As one example the arbitrary set in this context may mean the chosen set of attributes deemed appropriate for this application. For instance in a context where the user picks courses for a meal to be prepared and the application creates an integrated how to cooking video the arbitrary set may include for example calories difficulty in preparation use of certain ingredients etc.

As implemented using the playlist generation application this second primary process evenly distributes exercise video clips into each of several groups in the generated video playlist for example such as major muscle groups e.g. clips having associated meta tags upper body lower body and core . Warm up and warm down periods may also be defined in this process. For example the desired structure may be governed by the programming itself based on the domain of the application. For instance in a workout application there is a certain ordering that an expert will define that the user should do for a given set of workout steps. That ordering is programmed into the application. As another instance the ordering might be a progression from easy to hard workout steps or the ordering might rotate muscle groups. In the context of a cooking application the ordering may be driven by how long each cooking step takes etc.

In one embodiment the final underlying structure is described in terms of percentage of total time e.g. either a percentage of total desired time defined by the user or a percentage of the actual total time of the generated playlist . One example of an underlying structure is as follows 15 warm up 20 upper body 25 lower body 25 core 115 warm down. In some cases a broad definition of the meta playlist may be coded into the application so that for example the resulting video playlist is not dangerous impossible unreasonable etc.

For each for example muscle group video clips are drawn from the filtered dataset from the first primary process above and arranged randomly or pseudo randomly or otherwise arranged with some variability to avoid exact repetition. Additional software logic may be used to allow for reasonable repetition of video clips and to make more fine tuned adjustments to the order of clips e.g. based on one or more rules such as for example clip B must always follow clip A .

A variety of underlying structures for playlists may be defined within the playlist generation application. For example a playlist structure may gradually increase intensity throughout the workout or evenly mix Pilates and yoga exercises. In some cases the structure is broadly pre determined based on consultation with an expert and the nuances and particulars are determined by the application based on the user s preferences.

The third primary process implements parameter based limits e.g. limits based on other of the user defined parameters not used in the first primary process above . More specifically certain user defined parameters establish limits for the video clip playlist. The most dominant example is the time duration parameter e.g. provided by the user in entry field of . The final playlist is generated to be close to or identical to this time duration limit. In other cases such as in a cooking example there is no time duration. If the user picks a turkey dressing green beans etc. that the user wants to eat at a certain time e.g. 6 00 PM then the playlist of videos has the user start earlier e.g. at 3 45 PM to ensure that the user completes the cooking on time. Meals for other users may require starting at an earlier or later time.

The software logic selects the appropriate clips from the filtered dataset taking each clip s length and overall number of clips into account and follows the underlying structure established in the second primary process above. Additional limits for the playlist generation application may be calories burned or total repetitions .

In other embodiments users may save and share generated workout videos e.g. playlists of clips . On a backend server this is implemented by saving and sharing a playlist data file. Any user who has access to an equivalent database of video clips is able to view the playlist data file as a workout video an equivalent database contains all of the video clips referenced or included in the video list some users may not have obtained or purchased all of the video clips found in a playlist of another user . A graphical user interface may be provided that permits users to modify existing or create new video clip playlists.

Various embodiments are now discussed below. In a first embodiment a method comprises receiving via input to a mobile user device user defined parameters generating by a server an exercise video playlist comprising a plurality of video clips the generating comprising selecting the plurality of video clips from a data repository based on the user defined parameters and further based on meta data for video content stored in the data repository and sending by the server the playlist for display on the mobile user device.

In one embodiment the playlist is displayed by a video player on a display of the user device. In one embodiment the content stored in the data repository is video clips and the meta data comprises associated meta tags for each of the video clips.

Non volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive e.g. a DVD RAM or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non volatile memory may also be a random access memory.

The non volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non volatile memory that is remote from the system such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface can also be used.

In this description various functions and operations may be described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor such as a microprocessor. Alternatively or in combination the functions and operations can be implemented using special purpose circuitry with or without software instructions such as using an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA . Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions or in combination with software instructions. Thus the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer readable media used to actually effect the distribution.

At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied at least in part in software. That is the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor such as a microprocessor executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory such as ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory cache or a remote storage device.

Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system middleware service delivery platform SDK Software Development Kit component web services or other specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as computer programs. Invocation interfaces to these routines can be exposed to a software development community as an API Application Programming Interface . The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.

A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory and or cache. Portions of this software and or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically just in time when needed for execution. Thus it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.

Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non recordable type media such as volatile and non volatile memory devices read only memory ROM random access memory RAM flash memory devices floppy and other removable disks magnetic disk storage media optical storage media e.g. Compact Disk Read Only Memory CD ROMS Digital Versatile Disks DVDs etc. among others. The computer readable media may store the instructions.

The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical optical acoustical or other forms of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. However propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. are not tangible machine readable medium and are not configured to store instructions.

In general a tangible machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides e.g. stores information in a form accessible by a machine e.g. a computer network device personal digital assistant manufacturing tool any device with a set of one or more processors etc. .

In various embodiments hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.
