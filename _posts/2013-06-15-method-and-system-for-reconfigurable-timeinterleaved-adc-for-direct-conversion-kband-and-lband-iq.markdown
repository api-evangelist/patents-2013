abstract: A signal receiver chip may be configured to handle a plurality of satellite signals. In this regard, for each received satellite signal the signal receiver chip may determine whether the received satellite signal is unprocessed or partially-processed off-chip; and when the received satellite signal is partially-processed off-chip, at least a portion of processing functions performed in the signal receiver chip may be bypassed. The received satellite signals may then be processed, to generate a corresponding output signals that is configured for communication over a local link. The processing functions bypassed in the signal receiver chip may comprise signal band conversion, particularly down converting from a first band used for over-the-air communication to a second band that is used during handling at receiver side. In this regard, the first band comprises K-band, Ku-band, or Ka-band, whereas the second band comprises L-band, half-L-band, or Extended-L-band.

In this regard in some instances at least some of the data communicated to or from devices in the in premises network e.g. the client devices may originate from or be destined for entities external to the network . Thus the gateway may be utilized to provide to the client devices access to external devices systems and or networks. In this regard communication involving a client may be unidirectional e.g. downlink transmissions of broadcast content or bi directional e.g. downlink streams of content and uplink communication of user related data such as status information validation authentication responses and or user commands or requests . Accordingly the gateway may be configured to facilitate and or handle reception and or transmission of signals that may be used to enable content distribution and or broadband accessibility in the in premises network e.g. to the plurality of client devices . This may be achieved by configuring the gateway to support appropriate internal and or external connections such as for example to enable connectivity to the plurality of client devices and or to various external and or remote devices systems or networks.

In this regard terrestrial broadcasts may comprise communication typically only downlink communication but the disclosure is not so limited of RF signals e.g. UHF or VHF band signals modulated in accordance with particular analog or digital standards. Example of television modulation transmission standards may comprise NTSC PAL or SECAM for analog television and ATSC or DVB standards for digital television. The disclosure however is not limited to any particular standard bands for terrestrial TV signals.

For example the satellite reception assembly may be configured to combine directly using circuitry incorporated into the satellite reception assembly or by using additional separate component s coupled thereto outputs corresponding to multiple concurrently received satellite inputs to enable increasing the number of concurrent viewers while simultaneously minimizing installation and service costs. In this regard rather than utilizing multiple links similar to link between the satellite reception assembly and the gateway data corresponding to the different satellite signals may be combined onto the same link e.g. the link .

The disclosure however is not so limited and the IF signals may span any suitable frequency range. Having N an integer number LNBs in the housing as illustrated in may allow receiving N satellite RF signals labeled RFto RF. For example the RFto RFmay comprise K Ka and or Ku band Direct Broadcast Satellite DBS signals. In some instances each RFsignal may correspond to a unique distinct satellite signal with the signals differing for example based on the source or the polarization e.g. RFmay correspond to a first polarization of a first satellite RFmay correspond to second polarization of the first satellite RFmay correspond to a first polarization of a second satellite and so on .

The combiner may be configured to process and combine input signals corresponding to the received RF signals RFto RF such as for example the outputs of the LNBs which in turn may correspond to the received RF signals RFto RF . For example the combiner may be operable to amplify downconvert filter and or digitize at least a portion of the input signals. The combiner may be configured to support full spectrum i.e. to capture an entire spectrum of each of one or more protocols of interest may be concurrently digitized or to only digitize a portion of the input signals such as depending on which channels or sub bands in the signals are selected by client devices e.g. which television channels are being consumed by the client devices . Once the processing of the input signals or portions thereof is complete the combiner may be operable to recover information carried in the signals e.g. one or more channels contained therein and may generate output signals carrying the recovered information. The output signals may be sent to the link driver for transmission thereby e.g. to the gateway . In some instances the output signals may be processed in the combiner before being forwarded to the link driver . For example the combiner may be operable to convert to analog upconvert filter and or amplify the output signals.

In operation the housing may be configured to receive and or handle concurrently multiple satellite inputs. For example the LNBs may be used to concurrently receive a plurality of satellite signals RF RF e.g. generating a corresponding plurality of signals IF IF which may then be combined via the combiner onto a single output that may be transmitted over a single link via the link driver such as for example to a particular device configured for handling the multiple concurrent satellite feeds e.g. the gateway .

In various implementations satellite signal receiver assemblies e.g. assembly or components thereof e.g. the housing may incorporate use of optimized circuitry that may allow for on chip downconversion of satellite signals while also being able to handle partially processed signals e.g. signals subjected to downconversion off chip . For example such circuit chip may be configurable to support concurrently signals corresponding to the over the air bands e.g. K Ku Ka band signals or simply K band i.e. performing LNB functionality on chip as well as handling signals corresponding to down converted bands e.g. L half L Ext L band signals or simply L band i.e. from external LNB circuitry. For example with reference to in an example implementation one or more of the LNBs may be incorporated into a single chip which in turn may be configured to support handling already processed signals from the remaining ones of the LNBs . An example implementation scheme is shown in and described with respect to .

Additionally the signal receiver may also be configured to support handling pre processed e.g. already downconverted signals e.g. using external LNBs . The signal receiver may correspond to at least a portion of the housing when implemented in accordance with the present disclosure. The signal receiver may comprise for example a K band direct conversion receiver DCR portion and an L band portion .

The K band DCR portion can down convert received K band signals e.g. K Ku and Ka signals typically used in over the air satellite transmission to a lower band e.g. 1 GHz corresponding to L band typically used for IF signals corresponding to satellite receptions . In an example implementation the K band DCR portion may be configured to perform the down conversion based on quadrature processing. For example the K band DCR portion may comprise an input amplifier mixers and a local oscillator LO and output amplifiers and . In this regard the input amplifier may comprise a programmable amplifier. The input amplifier may be used in amplifying a received satellite RF signal for example to prepare the signal for mixing with local I Q signals . The LO may be operable to generate local signals having particular frequencies such as for use in signal processing operations. For example the LO may be operable to generate in phase I and quadrature signals Q signals corresponding to particular input RF signals e.g. K band signals to allow extraction of in phase and quadrature components. The mixers and may be operable to mix e.g. multiply a plurality of signals.

In addition the LNB chip may be operable to handle pre processed signals e.g. K band signals already down converted to L band or Extended L band . Accordingly in an example implementation the LNB chip may be incorporated into the signal receiver to provide an on chip full processing path e.g. down conversion such as form K band to L band and additional processing such as analog to digital conversion as applied to the L band signals while also providing the LNB chip with the capability to support pre processed signals e.g. perform only analog to digital conversion since the input signals are already downconverted . The reconfigurable time interleaved ADC component may be configured to performed analog to digital conversion doing so in adaptive manner e.g. being operable to perform analog to digital conversion on different bands such as both K band and L band .

For example the ADC component may be operable to handle both outputs of direct conversion K band I Q e.g. inputs to K band DCR portion or handling L band I Q signals e.g. inputs to L band portion . In this regard handling the direct conversion K band I Q may incorporate performing down conversion from K band to L band . Accordingly the reconfigurable time interleaved ADC component may be utilized to enable handling within the LNB chip both on chip down converted signals and off chip down converted signals i.e. the ADC component may be adaptively configured to handle I Q K band input s or to handle down converted L band I Q input s . Although the reconfigurable time interleaved ADC component is shown as a single ADC block the ADC component may actually incorporate a plurality of individual ADCs e.g. for each of the I Q inputs. An example implementation of a single chip for handling unprocessed and partially processed satellite signals is shown in and described with respect to .

In this regard the LNB platform may be configured to perform such functions as low noise amplification filtering downconverting e.g. particular received RF satellite signals such as K Ku or Ka band signals to generate IF signals in the L band half L band or Ext L band analog to digital conversion ADC and other. The LNB platform may also be configured to support interactions with other devices systems that may be used in conjunction with handling of received signals and or consumption of content carried thereby . For example the LNB platform may comprise suitable circuitry interfaces logic and or code for support communication of signals corresponding to the received RF signals e.g. containing content extracted therefrom to in home gateways or STBs and or to communicate unidirectionally or bidirectionally control related information e.g. to tune to specific bands sub bands or channels with these devices systems.

In various implementations of the invention the LNB platform may incorporate single integrated circuits chips for handling both unprocessed satellite signals e.g. K Ku Ka band signals or simply K band signals and to handle pre processed signals e.g. L half L Ext L band signals or simply L band signals which may originate from different sources such as external LNBs. For example the LNB platform may comprise one or more chips e.g. LNB chip each of which may be configured e.g. using on chip components to concurrently support handling different types of signals e.g. support bands corresponding to the directly received signals such as in K Ku Ka band satellite signals as well as bands corresponding to partially processed signals such as L half L Ext L band IF signals resulting from down converting K band signals for example .

For example the LNB chip may comprise suitable circuitry interfaces logic and or code configured to perform LNB based functions including downconversion of received RF signals into corresponding IF signals as well as to handle partially processed signals such as in other external LNB blocks. The LNB chip may be operable to handle for example N N being positive integer unprocessed inputs e.g. RF inputs RF RF corresponding to N different K band inputs for example and to handle for example M M being positive integer partially processed inputs e.g. IS IS corresponding to for example M different L band inputs . For example the LNB chip may comprise a plurality of direct conversion receivers DCRs a signal processor a network processor and a controller . In this regard each of the DCRs may be operable to receive RF signals e.g. corresponding to unprocessed K band signals and down convert them e.g. to L band signals . Each of the DCRs may be similar to and or may function in similar manner as the K band DCR portion of .

The signal processor may be operable to perform various functions or operations necessary to recover or extract data e.g. content carried in the received signals. In this regard the signal processor may be configured to handle signals in the down converted bands e.g. L bands . Accordingly the signal processor may receive directly the partially processed inputs IS IS and outputs of the DCRs corresponding to processing e.g. down conversion of the unprocessed inputs RF RF . Operations or functions performed by the signal processor may comprise tuning e.g. full spectrum capture of FSC tuning filtering amplification analog to digital conversion demodulation and the like. The signal processor may output data e.g. transport streams TS which may be modulated according to particular standard for example such as MPEG corresponding to the processed input signals unprocessed and or partially processed inputs .

The network processor may be operable to handle communicating data e.g. extracted content corresponding to the processed inputs to other devices e.g. gateway of . For example the network processor may be configured to generate IP packets e.g. based on TS outputted by the signal processor and or perform MAC PHY processing as necessary to communicate the IP packets.

The controller may be operable to control at least some of the operations performed by or in the LNB chip . For example the controller may be configured to generate control signals to control or adjust functions or operations of various components of the LNB chip . In some instances the controller may be configured to interact with other external entities devices systems or the like such as for example using digital satellite equipment control DiSEqC signaling. For example the controller may support interactions with the devices receiving the output of the LNB chip e.g. gateways STBs for example to coordinate communication of the data and or adjust the data e.g. change select channels . The controller may also support interactions with the devices sending signals inputs to the LNB chip such as external LNBs for example sending partially processed e.g. downconverted to L band singles.

The LNB chip may utilize to handle satellite signals particularly handling both unprocessed signals e.g. K band signals and processed partially signals e.g. L band signals corresponding already down converted signals such as via external LNBs . In this regard the LNB chip may be operable to provide on chip down conversion of unprocessed signals as part of the overall processing performed thereby while also being operable to forgo that down conversion when handling already processed signals. Use of chips such as the LNB chip may be desirable because inclusion of the down conversion directly on the chip may allow reducing cost e.g. by reducing circuitry floorplan area and enhancing performance e.g. reducing processing time since more operations are done on the same chip . In addition by incorporating the capability to support handling of already processed signals the chip may be utilized in a manner that may ensure backward compatibility e.g. a signal receiver integrating the chip may still be able to work with legacy existing LNB systems.

The chip may comprise suitable circuitry interfaces logic and or code for use in handling and or processing signals. In this regard the chip may be configured to handle and or process signals in accordance with particular functionality such as part of LNB functionality in full or part . The chip may be configured to support handling or processing separately or concurrently signals corresponding to different bands which may allow use of the chip for providing selective on chip direct down conversion of received RF signals as well partially received signals e.g. satellite signals that have already been down converted via other components or devices such as external LNB blocks . The chip may correspond to an example implementation of the LNB chip or portion thereof of . As shown in the implementation depicted in the chip may be configured to support unprocessed signals inputs and e.g. corresponding to RF signals e.g. satellite K Ka Ku band based signals as received and 4 partially processed e.g. already down converted signals inputs and e.g. corresponding to L half L Ext L band based IF signals. The disclosure however is not so limited and in various implementations different number of inputs and or combinations unprocessed partially processed signals may be supported and may be used with other types of signals i.e. non satellite signals .

For example as shown in the chip may comprise a plurality e.g. six of low noise amplifiers LNAs a plurality e.g. two of mixer blocks a plurality e.g. two of low pass filters LPF a plurality e.g. two of selectors a plurality e.g. four of analog to digital convertor ADC blocks local oscillator LO blocks and a wideband WB digital front end DFE a plurality of narrowband NB digital front ends DFEs and a digital signal processing DSP .

Each LNA may be operable to amplify signals. In this regard LNAs may typically be used to amplify possibly weak signals such as signals captured via antennas and other means for capturing wirelessly communicated signals e.g. satellite signals .

Each mixer block may be operable to mix e.g. multiply a plurality of signals. For example in some instances the pair of mixer blocks and may be used to apply respectively in phase and quadrature signals i.e. signals that would allow extraction of in phase I and quadrature Q components corresponding to particular received RF signals such as to allow IQ calibration. Thus the inputs and may actually correspond to the same RF input. Alternatively each of the mixer blocks and may be configured to apply both of the I Q components thus each of the inputs and may correspond to different RF signals.

Each ADC block may be operable to perform analog to digital conversion. In this regard the ADC block may be configured to perform the analog to digital conversion by sampling the input analog signal periodically e.g. obtaining samples at particular times as determined by the sampling rate . In other words the ADC block may operate by converting a continuous time and continuous amplitude analog signal to a sequence of digital values i.e. a discrete time and discrete amplitude digital signal . In some instances one or more of ADC block may incorporate multiple ADC slices rather than a single ADC . For example at least each of the ADC blocks and block may incorporate two ADC slices. The use of multiple ADC slices may allow re configurability of analog to digital conversion operation particularly in time interleaved manner. In this regard when handling inputs that are downconverted within the chip e.g. inputs or the ADC block may be configured to handle the I Q components of the inputs e.g. a first ADC slice may be configured and used as I slice i.e. used to perform analog to digital conversion on I component whereas a second ADC slice may be configured as Q slice i.e. used to perform analog to digital conversion on Q component. On the other hand when handling already downconverted inputs e.g. inputs or the two ADC slices may be configured such that may be used together to perform analog to digital conversion on the whole input i.e. each slice being used to sample the input at different instances such that the overall resultant digital output corresponding to the input results from combining of both sample streams.

The DFE may be operable to perform various signal processing functions such as I Q calibration equalization channelization or the like. In an example implementation the DFE may also be configured to function as multiple input multiple output switching crossbar Xbar whereby one or more inputs may be processed combined and or mapped to one or more outputs. The DFE may be configured as a wideband processing block i.e. being operable to apply the various processing function on a wideband such as a full L band K band or the like . Each of the NB DFEs may be similar to the DFE i.e. being configured to provide similar digital front end or DFE processing functions but to do so on narrow bands. Accordingly the NB DFEs may be operable to handle and or process different sub bands within a wideband that is processed in the DFE .

The DSP may comprise suitable circuitry interfaces logic and or code for digitally manipulating and or applying computationally intensive digital based processing on data during communication operations e.g. on samples that may be obtained from digitization of signals such as result of application of analog to digital conversion . The DSP may be operable to perform for example encoding decoding modulation de modulation encryption decryption scrambling descrambling channel selection and or filtering digital scaling and or rate conversion. In some instances the DSP may be configured to process digitized data to enable communicating it in digital form and or after conversion to analog signals over particular interface e.g. based on the type of the link of . In this regard the DSP may be operable to select apply and or adjust a modulation scheme error coding scheme and or data rates based on type and or characteristics of interface being used in communicating the signals carrying the data .

The chip may be utilized to handle satellite signals particularly both unprocessed signals e.g. K band signals and partially processed signals e.g. L band signals corresponding already down converted signals such as via external LNBs . For example inputs and may correspond to unprocessed signals whereas inputs and may correspond to pre partially processed signals. Accordingly to handle unprocessed signals the RF inputs fed as inputs and may first be amplified via the LNAs and and then LO block may be configured to generate suitable I Q signals for each of the inputs and . For example the inputs and may comprise signals in the 10.75 to 12.75 GHz range and the I Q signals generated by the LO block may be in 11.75 GHz range. The I Q signals may then be applied via the mixer and i.e. each of the mixer and may apply both I and Q signals accordingly each of the mixer and may be implemented as dual mixers one for each of the I Q signals . The output of the mixer and may then be filtered via the LPFs and to obtain only portions in the lower bands e.g. in the 1 GHz band . Thus the on chip down conversion of inputs and may be complete. The selectors and may then be configured e.g. via suitable control signal s to select for output the filtered signals outputted by the LPFs and . The ADC blocks and may then be utilized to apply analog to digital conversion with the corresponding outputs being feed to DFE for handling thereby and or by the remaining components e.g. NB DFEs and the DSP to enable extracting data e.g. content and generate corresponding output s for communication to for example a gateway STB.

To handle pre processed signals the inputs fed as inputs and may first be amplified via the LNAs and . Next because on chip down conversion is not require having been done off chip the down conversion components e.g. the LO block the mixer and and the LPFs and may be bypassed or disabled. The outputs of the LNAs and corresponding to inputs and may then be inputted into the ADC blocks and . As for inputs and the selectors and may then be configured e.g. via suitable control signal s to select for input into the ADC blocks and the signals outputted by the LNAs and . The ADC blocks may then be utilized to apply analog to digital conversion on all of the inputs and with the corresponding outputs being feed to DFE for handling thereby and or by the remaining components e.g. NB DFEs and the DSP to enable extracting data e.g. content and generate corresponding output s for communication to for example a gateway STB.

In step the chip may receive an input signal corresponding to a satellite signal. In step it may be determined whether the received input signal is unprocessed or pre partially processed signal. In this regard unprocessed signals may correspond to satellite signals as received over the air whereas pre partially processed signals may correspond to signals that have been received and already partially handled e.g. via external LNB . For example the unprocessed signals may comprise K Ku Ka band signals whereas the pre partially processed signals may comprise L half L Ext L band signals. In instances where it may be determined that the received input signal is unprocessed the process may proceed to step . In step the unprocessed signal may be handled e.g. by performing necessary additional handling processing required for unprocessed satellite signal including down conversion e.g. from K Ku Ka band to L half L Ext L band for example. The process may then proceed to step .

Returning to step in instances where it may be determined that the received input signal is pre partially processed the process may skip step and jump directly to step . In step the down converted signal may processed such as to extract data e.g. content carried by the signal. Processing down converted signal may comprise analog to digital conversions for example. In step output signal s may be generated based on the processing of the input signals being configured for communication over a local link e.g. MoCA etc. carrying the extracted data e.g. content . The output signal may then be communicated to a local device e.g. gateway STB . In some instances data e.g. content may be combined from multiple input signals onto a single output such as using stacking techniques. Once the output is generated and or communicated the process may loop back to step .
