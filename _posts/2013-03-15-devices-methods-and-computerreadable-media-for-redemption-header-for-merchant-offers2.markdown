This invention relates generally to merchant offers for goods and service and more particularly to redemption of certain offers such as online coupons.

Offer discovery systems provide a service by which merchants inform customers of offers for example deals e.g. discounts favorable shipping terms or rebates or coupons e.g. printable coupons for in store use or coupon codes for use online . Typically the systems store information about offers from a relatively large number of merchants and provide an interface by which customers can identify offers in which the customer is likely to be interested. Merchants have found the offer discovery systems to be a relatively effective form of marketing as cost sensitive consumers are drawn to such systems due to their relatively comprehensive listings of offers. Such offers may include coupons such as include traditional in store coupons and online coupons typically obtained via the Internet such as from merchant websites e mail distributions etc. To use an online coupon a customer typically provides an identifier such as a coupon code when purchasing goods and services from a merchant s online store. However a customer may forget about the existence of the coupon and as a result fail to take advantage of the offer presented by the coupon. Additionally it may be challenging for a customer to remember the identifier presented by the coupon and to use the online coupon in the manner specified by the online store. And the advent of smaller computing devices having different or limited interfaces may increase the challenges faces by customers attempting to use online coupons.

Various embodiments of devices computer implemented methods and computer readable media for a redemption header for merchant offers are provided herein.

Although the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. The drawings may not be to scale. It should be understood however that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed but to the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.

The above mentioned deficiencies in existing offer discovery systems may be mitigated by certain embodiments of an offer discovery system illustrated by . The exemplary system includes an offers engine that in some embodiments is capable of reducing the burden on users attempting to identify offers relevant to them from among a relatively large pool of offers e.g. more than 100 more than 1 000 or more than 10 000 and redeem selected offers. The system provides instructions to user devices that when executed by the user devices implement an offer redemption user interface described below with reference to . This interface in some cases assets the user with recall and entry of a coupon code or other offer related data at a merchant s website. This interface and the associated instructions are described in greater detail below following a description of other aspects of the system which provides complimentary but independent benefits to those of the interfaces of .

In some embodiments the offers engine maintains device independent user profiles or portions of user profiles by which offers interfaces may be relatively consistently configured across multiple user devices with which the user interacts with the offers engine . Further the offers engine in some embodiments includes a number of features expected to facilitate relatively quick identification of relevant offers by a user features that include cached storage of data related to likely relevant offers faceted presentation of offers by which users can select among offers within various categories and a number of other techniques described below for assisting with offer identification. The offers engine is also expected to facilitate relatively low operating costs by in some embodiments automating parts of the process by which offer related data is acquired from sources such as affiliate networks merchants administrators or users and automating parts of the process by which transaction data indicative of acceptance settlement or clearing of offers is obtained and processed.

These and other benefits are described in greater detail below after introducing the components of the system and describing their operation. It should be noted however that not all embodiments necessarily provide all of the benefits outlined herein and some embodiments may provide all or a subset of these benefits or different benefits as various engineering and cost tradeoffs are envisioned.

In the illustrated embodiment the offers engine includes a control module an application program interface API server a web server an ingest module an administration module a data store and a cache server . These components in some embodiments communicate with one another in order to provide the functionality of the offers engine described herein. As described in greater detail below in some embodiments the data store may store data about offers and users interactions with those offers the cache server may expedite access to this data by storing likely relevant data in relatively high speed memory for example in random access memory or a solid state drive the web server may serve webpages having offers interfaces by which users discover relevant offers the API server may serve data to various applications that process data related to offers the ingest module may facilitate the intake of data related to offers from affiliate networks users administrators and merchants and the administration module may facilitate curation of offers presented by the API server and the web server . The operation of these components and may be coordinated by the control module which may bidirectionally communicate with each of these components or direct the components to communicate with one another. Communication may occur by transmitting data between separate computing devices e.g. via transmission control protocol internet protocol TCP IP communication over a network by transmitting data between separate applications or processes on one computing device or by passing values to and from functions modules or objects within an application or process e.g. by reference or by value.

Among other operations the offers engine of this embodiment presents offers to users receives data from users about their interaction with the offers for example the user s favorite offers or offer attributes statistics about the offers the user has identified accepted or otherwise provided data about or the identity of other users with whom the user communicates about offers and the content of those communications provided that users opt to have such data obtained customizes the presentation of offers based on this received data and facilitates the processing of compensation from merchants either directly or through affiliate networks as a result of users accepting or taking a specific action like clicking or viewing in some embodiments or use cases offers. This interaction with users may occur via a website viewed on a desktop computer tablet or a laptop of the user. And in some cases such interaction occurs via a mobile website viewed on a smart phone tablet or other mobile user device or via a special purpose native application executing on a smart phone tablet or other mobile user device. Presenting and facilitating interaction with offers across a variety of devices is expected to make it easier for users to identify and recall relevant offers at the time the user is interested in those offers which is often different from the time at which the user first discovers the offers. In particular some embodiments allow users to store data indicative of offers relevant to that user using one device such as a desktop computer in the user s home and then view those offers at a later time such as on a native mobile application when in a retail store.

To illustrate an example of the environment in which the offers engine operates the illustrated embodiment of includes a number of components with which the offers engine communicates mobile user devices and a desk top user device a third party server an administrator device merchant servers and and affiliate network servers and . Each of these devices communicates with the offers engine via a network such as the Internet or the Internet in combination with various other networks like local area networks cellular networks or personal area networks.

The mobile user devices and may be smart phones tablets gaming devices or other hand held networked computing devices having a display a user input device e.g. buttons keys voice recognition or a single or multi touch touchscreen memory such as a tangible machine readable non transitory memory a network interface a portable energy source e.g. a battery and a processor a term which as used herein includes one or more processors coupled to each of these components. The memory of the mobile user devices and may store instructions that when executed by the associated processor provide an operating system and various applications including a web browser or a native mobile application . The native application in some embodiments is operative to provide an offers interface that communicates with the offers engine and facilitates user interaction with data from the offers engine . Similarly the web browser may be configured to receive a website from the offers engine having data related to deals and instructions for example instructions expressed in JavaScript that when executed by the browser which is executed by the processor cause the mobile user device to communicate with the offers engine and facilitate user interaction with data from the offers engine . The native application and the web browser upon rendering a webpage from the offers engine may generally be referred to as client applications of the offers engine which in some embodiments may be referred to as a server. Embodiments however are not limited to client server architectures and the offers engine as illustrated may include a variety of components other than those functioning primarily as a server.

The desk top user device may also include a web browser that serves the same or similar role as the web browser in the mobile user device . In addition the desk top user device may include a monitor a keyboard a mouse memory a processor and a tangible non transitory machine readable memory storing instructions that when executed by the processor provide an operating system and the web browser.

Third party offer server may be configured to embed data from the offers engine in websites or other services provided by the third party offer server . For example third party offer server may be a server of a social networking service upon which users post comments or statistics about offers with which the user has interacted or the users may use the offer server to recommend offers to others or identify offers to avoid. In another example third party offer server may include various services for publishing content to the Web such as blogs tweets likes dislikes ratings and the like. In another example third party offer server provides services by which third parties curate offers hosted by the offers engine .

Merchant servers and host websites or other user accessible content interfaces by which users can accept offers hosted by the offers engine . In some embodiments and in some use cases the merchant servers and host retail websites that present a plurality of items for sale by the merchant a subset of which may include items to which offers apply thereby generally making the item for sale more desirable to cost sensitive consumers than under the terms presented by the merchant in the absence of the offer. For example the offers may include free or discounted shipping a discounted price a bulk discount a rebate a referral award or a coupon such as a coupon acceptable by presenting a coupon code during checkout on the merchant website or a printable or displayable coupon e.g. on the screen of a mobile device for in store use the printable or otherwise displayable coupon having in some cases a machine readable code e.g. a bar code or QR code for display and scanning or a code passed via near field communication or Bluetooth . In some embodiments the merchant website includes a checkout webpage having an interface for the user to enter payment information and a coupon code and the merchant website either with logic on the client side or the server side may validate the coupon code entered by the user and upon determining that the coupon code is valid adjust the terms presented to the user for acceptance in accordance with the offer.

Some merchants may limit the number of uses of a given coupon limit the duration over which the coupon is valid or apply other conditions to use of the coupon each of which may add to the burden faced by users seeking to find valid coupons applicable to an item the user wishes to purchase. As noted above some embodiments of the offers engine are expected to mitigate this burden.

Further in some embodiments the merchant servers and provide data about offers to the offers engine or i.e. and or as used herein unless otherwise indicated data about transactions involving offers. In use cases in which the operator of the offers engine has a direct affiliate marketing relationship with one of the merchants of the merchant servers or the transaction data may provide the basis for payments by the merchant directly to the operator of the offers engine . For example payments may be based on a percentage of transactions to which offers were applied a number of sales to which offers were applied or a number of users who viewed or selected or otherwise interacted with an offer by the merchant.

Affiliate network servers and in some embodiments and some use cases are engaged when the entity operating the offers engine does not have a direct affiliate marketing relationship with the merchant making a given offer. In many affiliate marketing programs merchants compensate outside entities such as third party publishers for certain activities related to sales by that merchant and spurred by the outside entity. For example in some affiliate marketing programs merchants compensate an affiliate such as the entity operating the offers engine in cases in which it can be shown that the affiliate provided a given coupon code to a given user who then used that coupon code in a transaction with the merchant. Demonstrating this connection to the merchant is one of the functions of the affiliate networks.

Affiliate networks are used in some use cases because many coupon codes are not affiliate specific and are shared across multiple affiliates as the merchant often desires the widest distribution of a relatively easily remembered coupon code. Accordingly in some use cases the merchant affiliate network and affiliate cooperate to use client side storage to indicate the identity of the affiliate that provided a given coupon code to a user. To this end in some embodiments when a webpage offers interface is presented by the offers engine in the web browsers or that webpage is configured by the offers engine to include instructions to engage the affiliate network server or when a user selects an offer for example by clicking on touching or otherwise registering a selection of an offer. The website provided by the offers engine responds to such a selection by in some embodiments transmitting a request to the appropriate affiliate network server or as identified by for example an associated uniform resource locator URL in the webpage for a webpage or portion of a webpage e.g. browser executable content . The request to the affiliate network server may include e.g. as parameters of the URL an identifier of the affiliate the offer and the merchant and the returned content from the affiliate network server may include instructions for the web browser or to store in memory e.g. in a cookie or other form of browser accessible memory such as a SQLite database or in a localStorage object via a localStorage.setItem command an identifier of the affiliate that provided the offer that was selected.

The webpage from the offers engine or the content returned by the affiliate network server or may further include browser instructions to navigate to the website served by the merchant server or of the merchant associated with the offer selected by the user and in some cases to the webpage of the item or service associated with the offer selected by the user. When a user applies the offer for example by purchasing the item or service or purchasing the item or service with the coupon code the merchant server or may transmit to the user device upon which the item was purchased browser instructions to request content from the affiliate network server or and this requested content may retrieve from the client side memory the identifier of the affiliate such as the operator of the offers engine who provided the information about the offer to the user. The affiliate network may then report to the merchant the identity of the affiliate who should be credited with the transaction and the merchant may compensate the affiliate or the affiliate network may bill the merchant and the affiliate network may compensate the affiliate such as the operator of the offers engine . Thus the affiliate network in this example acts as an intermediary potentially avoiding the need for cross domain access to browser memory on the client device a feature which is generally not supported by web browsers for security reasons. Some embodiments may however store in client side browser accessible memory an identifier of the affiliate upon user selection of the offer with this value designated as being accessible via the merchant s domain and provide the value to the merchant upon a merchant request following acceptance of the offer without passing the identifier through an affiliate network using a browser plug in for providing cross domain access to browser memory or a browser otherwise configured to provide such access. 

A similar mechanism may be used by the native application for obtaining compensation from merchants. In some embodiments the native application includes or is capable of instantiating a web browser like the web browser in response to a user selecting an offer presented by the native application . The web browser instantiated by the native application may be initialized by submitting the above mentioned request for content to the affiliate network server or thereby storing an identifier of the affiliate i.e. the entity operating the offers engine in this example in client side storage e.g. in a cookie localStorage object or a database of the mobile user device and thereby navigating that browser to the merchant website. In other use cases the operator of the offers engine has a direct relationship with the merchant issuing the offer and the selection of an offer within the native application or the desktop or mobile website of the offers engine generally referred to herein as examples of an offer interface may cause the user device to request a website from the associated merchant with an identifier of the affiliate included in the request for example as a parameter of a URL transmitted in a GET request to the merchant server or for the merchant s website.

Administrator device may be a special purpose application or a web based application operable to administer operation of the offers engine e.g. during use by employees or agents of the entity operating the offers engine . In some embodiments the administration module may communicate with the administrator device to present an administration interface at the administrator device by which an administrator may configure offers interfaces presented to users by the offers engine . In some embodiments the administrator may enter offers into the offers engine delete offers from the offers engine identify offers for prominent placement within the offers interface e.g. for initial presentation prior to user interaction moderate comments on offers view statistics on offers merchants or users add content to enhance the presentation of offers or categorize offers.

Thus the offers engine in some embodiments operates in the illustrated environment by communicating with a number of different devices and transmitting instructions to various devices to communicate with one another. The number of illustrated merchant servers affiliate network servers third party servers user devices and administrator devices is selected for explanatory purposes only and embodiments are not limited to the specific number of any such devices illustrated by .

The offers engine of some embodiments includes a number of components introduced above that facilitate the discovery of offers by users. For example the illustrated API server may be configured to communicate data about offers via an offers protocol such as a representational state transfer REST based API protocol over hypertext transfer protocol HTTP . Examples of services that may be exposed by the API server include requests to modify add or retrieve portions or all of user profiles offers or comments about offers. API requests may identify which data is to be modified added or retrieved by specifying criteria for identifying records such as queries for retrieving or processing information about particular categories of offers offers from particular merchants or data about particular users. In some embodiments the API server communicates with the native application of the mobile user device or the third party offer server .

The illustrated web server may be configured to receive requests for offers interfaces encoded in a webpage e.g. a collection of resources to be rendered by the browser and associated plug ins including execution of scripts such as JavaScript invoked by the webpage . In some embodiments the offers interface may include inputs by which the user may request additional data such as clickable or touchable display regions or display regions for text input. Such inputs may prompt the browser to request additional data from the web server or transmit data to the web server and the web server may respond to such requests by obtaining the requested data and returning it to the user device or acting upon the transmitted data e.g. storing posted data or executing posted commands . In some embodiments the requests are for a new webpage or for data upon which client side scripts will base changes in the webpage such as XMLHttpRequest requests for data in a serialized format e.g. JavaScript object notation JSON or extensible markup language XML . The web server may communicate with web browsers such as the web browser or executed by user devices or . In some embodiments the webpage is modified by the web server based on the type of user device e.g. with a mobile webpage having fewer and smaller images and a narrower width being presented to the mobile user device and a larger more content rich webpage being presented to the desk top user device . An identifier of the type of user device either mobile or non mobile for example may be encoded in the request for the webpage by the web browser e.g. as a user agent type in an HTTP header associated with a GET request and the web server may select the appropriate offers interface based on this embedded identifier thereby providing an offers interface appropriately configured for the specific user device in use.

The illustrated ingest module may be configured to receive data about new offers e.g. offers that are potentially not presently stored in the data store such as data feeds from the affiliate network servers and identifications of offers from user devices or offers identified by third party offer server offers identified by merchant servers or or offers entered by an administrator via the administrator device . In some embodiments the ingest module may respond to receipt of a record identifying a potentially new offer by querying the data store to determine whether the offer is presently stored. Upon determining that the offer is not presently stored by the data store the ingest module may transmit a request to the data store to store the record. In some cases the data about new offers may be an affiliate data feed from an affiliate network containing a plurality of offer records e.g. more than 100 each record identifying offer terms a merchant a URL of the merchant associated with the offer a product description and an offer identifier. The ingest module may periodically query such data feeds from the affiliate network servers or parse the data feeds and iterate through or map each entry to one of a plurality of processes operating in parallel the records in the data feeds. Bulk automated processing of such data feeds is expected to lower operating costs of the offers engine .

The administration module may provide an interface by which an administrator operating the administrator device curates and contextualizes offers. For example the administration module may receive instructions from administrator that identify offers to be presented in the offer interface prior to user interaction with the offer interface or offers to be presented in this initialized offers interface for certain categories of users such as users having certain attributes within their user profile. Further in some embodiments the administration module may receive data descriptive of offers from the administrator such as URLs of images relevant to the offer categorizations of the offer normalized data about the offer and the like.

The illustrated data store in some embodiments stores data about offers and user interactions with those offers. The data store may include various types of data stores including relational or non relational databases document collections hierarchical key value pairs or memory images for example. In this embodiment the data store includes a user data store a session data store an offers data store and an analytics data store . These data stores and may be stored in a single database document or the like or may be stored in separate data structures.

In this embodiment the illustrated user data store includes a plurality of records each record being a user profile and having a user identifier a list of offers e.g. identifiers of offers identified by the user as favorites a list of categories of offers identified by the user as favorites a list of merchants identified by the user as favorites account information for interfacing with other services to which the user subscribes e.g. a plurality of access records each record including an identifier of a service a URL of the service a user identifier for the service an OAuth access token credential issued by the service at the user s request and an expiration time of the credential a user password for the offers engine a location of the user device or the user e.g. a zip code of the user and a gender of the user. In some embodiments each user profile includes a list of other users identified by the user of the user profile as being people in whose commentary on or curation of offers the user is interested thereby forming an offers interest graph. In some embodiments users have control of their data including what is stored and who can view the data and can choose to opt in to the collection and storage of such user data to improve their experience with the offers engine .

In this embodiment the session data store stores a plurality of session records each record including information about a session a given user is having or has had with the offers engine . The session records may specify a session identifier a user identifier and state data about the session including which requests have been received from the user and what data has been transmitted to the user. Session records may also indicate the IP address of the user device timestamps of exchanges with the user device and a location of the user device e.g. retail store or aisle in a retail store in which the user device is located .

The illustrated offers data store in some embodiments includes a plurality of offer records each offer record may identify a merchant offers by that merchant and attributes of the relationship with the merchant e.g. whether there is a direct relationship with the merchant by which the merchant directly compensates the operator of the offers engine or whether the merchant compensates the operator of the offers engine via an affiliate network and which affiliate network. The offers by each merchant may be stored in a plurality of merchant offer records each merchant offer record may specify applicable terms and conditions of the offer e.g. whether the offer is a discount includes free or discounted shipping requires purchase of a certain number of items is a rebate or is a coupon which is not to suggest that these designations are mutually exclusive . In records in which the offer is a coupon the record may further indicate whether the coupon is for in store use e.g. whether the coupon is associated with a printable image for presentation at a point of sale terminal a mobile device displayable image or other mediums or whether the coupon is for online use and has a coupon code in which case the coupon code is also part of the merchant offer record. The merchant offer records may also include an expiration date of the offer comments on the offer rankings of the offer by users a time at which the offer was first issued or entered into the offers engine and values e.g. binary values indicating whether users found the offer to be effective with each value or ranking being associated with a timestamp in some embodiments. The values and rankings may be used to calculate statistics indicative of the desirability of the offer and likely success of accepting the offer. The timestamps associated with the values rankings and time of issuance or entry into the offers engine may also be used to weight rankings of the offer with older values being assigned less weight than newer values and older offers being ranked lower than newer offers all other things being equal as many offers expire or have a limited number of uses.

The illustrated analytics data store may store a plurality of records about historical interactions with the offers engine such as aggregate statistics about the performance of various offers. In some embodiments the analytics data store stores a plurality of transaction records each transaction record identifying an offer that was accepted by a user at a merchant the merchant the time of presentation of the offer to the user and an indicator of whether the merchant has compensated the entity operating the offers engine for presentation of the offer to the user. Storing and auditing these transaction records is expected to facilitate relatively accurate collection of payments owed by merchants and identification of future offers likely to lead to a relatively high rates of compensation for prominent presentation based on past performance of offers having similar attributes.

The cache server stores a subset of the data in the data store that is among the more likely data to be accessed in the near future. To facilitate relatively fast access the cache server may store cached data in relatively high speed memory such as random access memory or a solid state drive. The cached data may include offers entered into the offers engine within a threshold period of time such as offers that are newer than one day. In another example the cache data may include offers that are accessed with greater than a threshold frequency such as offers that are accessed more than once a day or offers accessed within the threshold such as offers accessed within the previous day. Caching such offer data is expected to facilitate faster access to offer data than systems that do not cache offer data.

The illustrated control module in some embodiments controls the operation of the other components of the offers engine receiving requests for data or requests to add or modify data from the API server the web server the ingest module and the administration module and instructing the data store to modify retrieve or add data in accordance with the request. The control module may further instruct the cache server to modify data mirrored in the cache server . In some embodiments the cache server may be updated hourly and inconsistent data may potentially be maintained in the cache server in order to conserve computing resources.

The illustrated components of the offers engine are depicted as discrete functional blocks but embodiments are not limited to systems in which the functionality described herein is organized as illustrated by . The functionality provided by each of the components of the offers engine may be provided by software or hardware modules that are differently organized than is presently depicted for example such software or hardware may be intermingled broken up distributed e.g. within a data center or geographically or otherwise differently organized. The functionality described herein may be provided by one or more processors of one or more computers executing code stored on a tangible non transitory machine readable medium.

The process in some embodiments includes normalizing and enriching the offer data. Normalizing may include normalizing field names of the data and normalizing the way in which dates are expressed for example. Enriching may include associating images with the offers for presentation with the offers and adding metadata to the offers to assist users searching for offers.

Next in the present embodiment the received offer data is stored in an offer data store as indicated by block . Storing the offer data in the offer data store may include identifying a merchant to which the offer pertains and storing the offer in a merchant offer record associated with that merchant. Further some embodiments may include inserting the offer in order in a sorted list of offers for relatively fast retrieval of offers using a binary search algorithm or other techniques to facilitate relatively quick access to data that has been preprocessed e.g. using a prefix trie . In some embodiments storing the received offer may further include updating hash tables by which the offer may be retrieved according to various parameters each hash table being associated with one parameter and including a hash key value calculated based on the parameter and paired with an address of the offer. Such hash tables are expected to facilitate relatively fast access to a given offer as the need to iterate through potentially all offers meeting certain criteria may be potentially avoided.

In some embodiments the process further includes receiving a request from a user device for offers as indicated by block . The request may specify criteria for identifying offers such as categories of offers search terms for offers or requests for offers designated as favorites.

Next the present embodiment includes identifying offers in the offer data store responsive to the user request as indicated by block . Identifying offers in the offer data store may be performed by the above mentioned controller by constructing a query to the offer data store based on a request received from the web server or the API server . The query may be transmitted to the offer data store or to the cache server each of which may return responsive records.

Next the identified offers are transmitted to the user device as indicated by block . Transmitting the identified offers may include transmitting the identified offers in an offer interface such as a webpage or an API transmission to a native mobile application for example by the web server or the API server of respectively.

The device receiving the identified offers may in response perform a process described below with reference to by which additional offers are requested or an offer is selected and a purchase is executed. This process of and steps through of may be repeated numerous times in some use cases before advancing to the next steps. Further the steps through may be repeated numerous times independently of e.g. concurrent with the performance of steps through of which is not to suggest that other steps described herein may not also be executed independently . That is the process may undergo step and for example 50 times within a given time while performing steps through 500 times within that given time and performing the remaining steps of process a single time.

In some embodiments a user device undergoing the process of may indicate to an offers engine that the user has selected an offer e.g. by clicking on or touching a selectable element in an offers interface associated with the offer . In response the offers engine may direct the user device to an affiliate network server or a merchant server associated with the offer as illustrated by block .

Next this embodiment of the process includes receiving from merchants or affiliate networks transaction data identifying offers accepted via the user device as illustrated by block . The transaction data may be pulled from these sources for example by the ingest module of periodically or in response to some threshold number of transactions having occurred.

Next in this embodiment the receipt transaction data may be stored in an analytics data store as indicated by block . In some embodiments this data may be stored in the analytics data store of . Storing the transaction data is expected to facilitate the identification of attributes of relatively profitable offers as the transaction data indicates which offers historically yielded compensable transactions. Further storing the transaction data is expected to facilitate relatively accurate auditing of payments from merchants or affiliate networks.

Some embodiments of process begin with receiving at a user device instructions that cause the user device to display an offers interface as indicated by block . The received instructions may be in the form of a downloaded native application such as one downloaded from an application store hosted by a provider of mobile devices or the received instructions may be in the form of a website received from the offers engine and rendered in a browser of the user device.

In some embodiments the process further includes receiving at the user device a plurality of offers as indicated by block and displaying at the user device the offers in the offer interface as indicated by block . The offers may be received at approximately the same time the instructions of step are received for example along with a webpage or the offers may be received at a later date for example during a session subsequent to downloading the native application.

The offers interface may include inputs by which the user may search filter or otherwise browse offers having various attributes. Some of these interfaces are described below with reference to steps performed to determine whether the user has engaged these inputs. In some embodiments determining whether the user has engaged these inputs may be performed by an event handler executed by the user device the event handler causing the user device to perform the corresponding below described requests to the offers engine based on the type of event e.g. whether the user touched clicked or otherwise selected a particular button on the offers interface.

Illustrated process includes determining whether the user is searching for offers as indicated by block . With the offers interface the user may express their intention to search for offers by entering search terms in a text entry box and selecting a button to request a search in accordance with the entered search term. Upon selecting this button the user device may transmit a request for offers satisfying the entered search criteria as indicated by block . The transmitted request may be in the form of a GET request or an API call to the web server or the API server of the offers engine of .

In some embodiments the process further includes determining whether the user requests offers within a collection of offers as indicated by block . The offers interface may include selectable inputs that identify the collections such as clickable collection names collection selection buttons or collection selection tabs. Examples of collections include categories of goods or services such as sporting goods house wares groceries and the like collections of modes of coupon redemption such as in store coupon redemption and online coupon redemption collections based on offer statistics such as newest offers most popular offers highest ranked offers collections of offers designated by a user or other users or collections based the value conferred by the offer such as discounts free shipping rebates and referral fees. Upon determining that the user has requested offers within a collection the user device may transmit a request for offers within the collection to the offers engine as indicated by block which may return data responsive to the request.

In some embodiments the process includes determining whether the user requests offers previously designated by the user as indicated by block . In some embodiments the offers interface may include an input by which a user can designate an offer such as designating offers as being a user favorite designating offers as being ranked in a particular fashion or designating offers as likely being of interest to some other user such as users adjacent one another in a social graph. The offers interface may include an input for a user to make designations such as a user selectable input labeled add to my favorites or add to my wallet and an input for a user to request offers having a designation such as a user selectable input labeled view my favorites. or view my wallet. Upon determining that the user made such a request the process includes transmitting a request for the offers previously designated by the user as indicated by block . The transmission may be made to the offers engine to the API server or the web server as described above with reference to and may include an identification of the designation and the user.

The process in some embodiments further includes determining whether the user requests offers previously designated by another user as indicated by block . The offers interface in some embodiments may include an input by which a user makes such a request such as a user selectable input labeled offers recommended by my friends. Upon determining that the user has made such a request the process transmits a request for offers previously designated by the other user or users as indicated by block . Again the transmission may be to the offers engine of which may store or otherwise have access to offers designated by other users and a social graph of the user by which responsive offers are identified. Further the offers interface may include an input by which the user may view identifiers of other users and add the other users to an offer interest graph of the user. This offer interest graph may be referenced by the offers engine to identify offers in response to the request of step .

The process further includes in some embodiments receiving at the user device one or more offers responsive to the request as indicated by block and displaying the responsive offers on the offers interface as indicated by block .

In some embodiments and some use cases a selection from the user is received via the offers interface thereby identifying an offer among the displayed offers as indicated by block . In some embodiments each of the offers may be displayed with an associated input by which the user selects the offer such as a touchable or clickable button region or text. The selection in some embodiments may cause the offers interface to request additional data from the offers engine such as instructions from the offers engine to navigate to an affiliate network server associated with the offer or to navigate to a merchant server associated with the offer. In other embodiments such instructions may be present within the offers interface e.g. in the form of URLs linking to these servers.

The process further includes determining whether the selected offer is compensable through an affiliate network as indicated by block . This determination may be made by the offers engine in some embodiments for each of the offers being displayed prior to transmission of the offers to the user device. For example each offer may be associated with a designation indicating whether the offer is compensable in this fashion and the designation may be transmitted along with the offer for instance by associating the offer with HTML or JavaScript that so designate the offer or by including a field including the designation in a response to an API call for each offer. The user device in some embodiments may take different actions depending on the designation associated with the selected offer.

Upon determining that the selected offer is not compensable through an affiliate network the process of this embodiment includes determining whether the selected offer is compensable directly from the merchant associated with the offer as indicated by block . Again the determination of block may be performed in some embodiments by the offers engine for each of the offers being displayed prior to transmission of the displayed offers and each displayed offer may be associated with a designation based on the results of the determination such as different HTML or JavaScript or a different field value in an API response. The user device may take different actions depending on this designation.

Upon determining that the selected offer is not compensable directly from the merchant the process may proceed to block described below. Upon determining that the selected offer is compensable the process in this embodiment may proceed to request the website of the merchant issuing the selected offer with a request that identifies the affiliate from whom the selected offer was obtained as indicated by block . The request may be in the form of a URL having as a parameter an identifier of the entity operating the offer engine thereby indicating to the merchant that the affiliate should be compensated in accordance with an arrangement between the merchant and the affiliate. Upon performance of step the process of the present embodiment proceeds to step described below.

As indicated by block upon determining that the selected offer is compensable through an affiliate network the process proceeds to transmit a request to the affiliate network server for instructions to store data identifying an affiliate from whom the selected offer was obtained as indicated by block . This request may be a request for content from the affiliate network server that is not displayed to the user or is not displayed to the user for an appreciable amount of time e.g. less than 500 ms and the request may include an identifier of the affiliate the merchant and the offer. The requested content may cause the user device to store in persistent memory of the browser of the user device e.g. memory that lasts between sessions such as a cookie or a database of the browser an identifier of the affiliate operating the offers engine . This value may be retrieved later by the affiliate network at the instruction of the merchant upon the user accepting the offer for example by the user using a coupon code associated with the offer at the merchant thereby allowing the merchant or the affiliate network to identify the appropriate party to compensate for the sale. The coupon code may be a relatively short text string e.g. shorter than 25 characters or 5 words selected to be both distinct and memorable to users. In some cases an image or other visibly distinctive user manipulable body of data serves the role of the coupon code.

Upon transmitting the request the affiliate network server the process further includes requesting the website of the merchant issuing the selected offer as indicated by block and transmitting acceptance of the offer to the merchant via the merchant s website as indicated by block . Accepting the offer as noted above may cause the merchant to compensate the affiliate operating the offers engine .

The process of is expected to facilitate relatively fast access to offers that are likely to be relevant to a user as each of the determinations of step and provide different paths by which the user can specify offers in which the user is likely to be interested. Further the determinations of step and provide dual mechanisms by which the operator of the offers engine can be compensated thereby potentially increasing revenue.

In some embodiments as described further below a website from the offers engine referred to as an offers website but which is not limited to websites that provides offers to users may include functionality to enable users to redeem certain types of offers e.g. online coupons. In such embodiments the offers engine may provide a redemption header also referred to as a traveling header in a merchant website for easier and faster redemption of online coupons and elimination or reduction of complicated user actions needed to redeem the online coupons. The header may be characterized as traveling in the sense that it is presented in or with webpages from two or more domains and as the header travels it may carry data from a domain having offers data e.g. coupon codes in the offers engine website to a domain in which the offers data is used to redeem the offer e.g. a merchant website thereby relieving the user of the burden of retaining and recalling this information. Accordingly the redemption header may result in increased rates of coupon redemption and increased sales for merchants offering online coupons provided by the offers engine. Embodiments however are not limited to systems that provide these benefits and some embodiments may provide other benefits as various engineering and cost tradeoffs are envisioned.

As explained below the redemption header may be provided in merchant websites provided from merchant servers to enable a user to easily view offer information after leaving the offers website from the offers engine . The header may be provided by the merchant server in the sense that the merchant server stores and sends the instructions and resources by which the header is rendered or in the sense that the merchant server sends instructions directing a web browser to retrieve these instructions and resources from another server e.g. a GET request to a network address of the offers engine of or a content delivery network.

The search field may enable a user to enter a search query and execute a search by selecting the search control e.g. a search button . The search may include searches for offers categories of offers merchants or any other suitable search queries. The navigation tabs may enable a user to navigate to different sections of an offers website such as by selecting e.g. clicking one of the navigation tabs . For example as shown in the navigation tabs may include for example a Coupon Codes tab a Printable Coupons tab a Grocery Coupons tab a Community tab and so on. The sign up control e.g. the illustrated Sign Up button may enable a user to create a user profile with the offers engine for customizing the content provided by the offers engine . Accordingly the login control e.g. the illustrated Login button may enable a user having a user profile with the offers engine to login and retrieve customizations and other profile attributes.

The merchant panel may include a title e.g. Popular Stores and a carousel or other visual element that displays selectable merchant tiles e.g. Merchant Merchant Merchant and Merchant . The merchant tiles may each display text images e.g. a logo or both associated with a merchant. A user may select one of the merchant tiles to select a merchant and display offers associated with the selected merchant in the offers area . Additionally a user may scroll the carousel by selecting e.g. clicking the scroll controls to scroll through the merchant tiles and view other merchants. The other elements may include selectable advertisements links to social networking integration e.g. a Like button a 1 button etc. links to other sections of the offers website links to regional versions of the offers website input fields for submission of user information e.g. email addresses and so on.

The offers area may present offers e.g. online coupons for viewing and selection by a user. The offers area may include any number of offers associated with merchants providing goods services or a combination thereof. The offers area may present offers based on ranking criteria user selections e.g. selections of a merchant offer categories etc. or other parameters. For example as shown in the offers area depicts top ranked offers as indicated by the Today s Top Coupons text displayed in the title . Each coupon may be presented with information associated with the coupon such as a merchant tile and a descriptive text . Additionally each coupon may include a coupon code box having an offer redemption identifier e.g. a coupon code associated with each coupon . The coupon code may be displayed in the coupon code box or other visual element such as a circle balloon etc. As described in detail below upon selection of one of the coupons the coupon code of a selected coupon may be conveyed to and displayed in a redemption header in a merchant website. The offer redemption identifier may also include for example discount descriptions e.g. 50 off of all sweatshirts rebate instructions e.g. Receive 20 rebate when purchasing a flash drive from Merchant identifiers of free goods or services e.g. Free tokens with the order of any large pizza or any other identifier associated with an offer that enables or describes the redemption of the offer to a user. Other offer redemption identifiers may be displayed in a box or other visual element in the offers area .

The merchant tile may include a text image e.g. a merchant logo or combination thereof identifying the merchant associated with the coupon. The descriptive text may include information about the coupon such as the goods services or both associated with the coupon the discount or other offer provided by the coupon the expiration date or any other suitable information or combination thereof. For example as shown in a first online coupon A may be presented with a merchant graphic A e.g. Merchant and descriptive text A e.g. 40 Off Save up to 40 on select diapers from Acme Co. Exp. Jun. 4 2012 . Additionally the first online coupon A includes a coupon box A having a coupon code A PMPRSYT8 associated with the coupon A. The other coupon B illustrated in may include similar information such as merchant tile B descriptive text B coupon code box B and so on.

To use a coupon a user may select e.g. touch click etc. one of the online coupons . For example a user may select any portion of the coupon A such as the merchant tile A the descriptive text A the coupon code box A etc. As described below upon selection of a coupon the browser executing on the user device may be redirected to the merchant website associated with the selected coupon. For example the merchant website may be presented in an existing window of the browser in a new window of the browser in a new tab of the browser or via other functions of the browser. Additionally upon selection of a coupon a value of the coupon code may be copied to a clipboard or other temporary storage. For example upon selection of the coupon A the value of the coupon code A PMPRSYT8 may be copied to a clipboard. The interactions described herein may be implemented with an event handler conveyed in instructions such as JavaScript from the offers engine of and executed by the web browser. Such instructions may include a mapping of events e.g. onclick ontouch and the like to JavaScript functions also provided by the offers engine that implement the corresponding functionality upon occurrence of the corresponding event. In some cases a browser add on such as Adobe Flash Player or other multimedia player having elevated security privileges relative to the browser is used to access the temporary storage. Or i.e. and or the coupon code may be stored in a subsequently created document object model DOM element of a traveling header.

It should be appreciated that the merchant website may include any number and type of webpages. For example the merchant webpage may include a landing page a storefront webpage a product webpage and other webpages. Additionally the merchant website may be provided via different types of domains associated with a merchant such as a parent domain associated with the merchant subdomains of the parent domain an mdot domain i.e. m. associated with the merchant and so on.

The redemption header may be provided in the merchant webpage as described in below and may remain on the other webpages of the merchant website as a user navigates the website . Thus the redemption header travels from the offers webpage to the merchant webpage and other webpages of the merchant website. By retaining the redemption header a user may have access to the coupon code A required to redeem the coupon A and instructions and other text associated with the selected coupon A. As shown in the redemption header may include descriptive text a coupon code box instructions and a close control e.g. a close button . The descriptive text may describe the contents function or both of the redemption header . For example the descriptive text may include the text Here is your Coupon Code describing the contents of the coupon code box presented in the bar . Accordingly the coupon code box may include the coupon code A associated with the selected coupon A. Additionally the instructions may provide instructions to the user on how to use the coupon code A and redeem the selected coupon A. For example as shown in the instructions include the text Copy paste at checkout to see your savings. Displaying the coupon code adjacent or in the merchant website may facilitate copying and pasting even if the browser does not have access to clipboard memory e.g. if an Adobe Flash browser plug in is disabled or absent as the user may highlight copy and paste the code manually accessing the clipboard memory from within the same visual context e.g. without switching to another window tab or website or writing down the code and typing it.

The merchant website may include a variety of web content that enables a user to search or browse for goods services or both and select and order such goods and services. As shown in for example web content of the merchant website may include a search field search button and a merchant storefront . It should be appreciated that the web content depicted in is merely an example and merchant websites may include a wide variety of web content designs and functionality. Such functionality may include for example the ability to search the merchant website by entering a search query into the search field and selecting e.g. touching clicking etc. the search button . Additionally the merchant storefront may display goods services or both offered by the merchant and available for order by a user. In some embodiments a user may use the search field to find the goods services or both associated with the selected coupon. In other embodiments the goods or services may be presented to the user in the merchant storefront based on the selected coupon A.

As mentioned above a user may navigate the merchant website by selecting the search button selecting links in the merchant storefront and so on. In response various webpages of the merchant website may be requested and displayed by the web browser. The redemption header may remain in such webpages until the user selects the close button which may be mapped by an event handler of the website to a JavaScript function that removes an element of the document object model corresponding to the redemption header. Thus regardless of the portion of the merchant website displayed by the web browser in some embodiments the redemption header and coupon code A may remain accessible e.g. visible and retrievable via a copy command to the user. For example depicts another screen of a browser illustrating a webpage of the merchant website in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the webpage of the merchant website may include a product listing having product text and product images . For example the webpage may include product text A and product image A associated with a first product product text B and product image B associated with a second product and so on. A user may navigate to the webpage by searching for a product selecting links in the merchant storefront or other navigation actions within the merchant website . Moreover as shown in the redemption header remains i.e. travels in the webpage through a sequence of merchant webpages. Thus while a user is viewing various products on the webpage the redemption header may remain to allow access to the information associated with the selected coupon.

As described above a user may use the merchant website to order goods and services associated with the selected coupon such as by adding the goods and services to a virtual shopping cart and selecting an option to checkout. depicts a screen of the browser illustrating a checkout page of the merchant website in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As described above web content such as the checkout page may be retrieved from the Internet via a network accessible by a user device executing the browser and this web content may be displayed by browser. As shown in the redemption header remains in the checkout webpage and includes the coupon code box and the coupon code A. The redemption header may remain accessible while a user completes a transaction e.g. an order for goods services or both with the merchant. Here again a user may remove the redemption header by selecting the close control . In some cases the header is only shown at the check out page or the header may be displayed in the preceding webpages e.g. while the user shops to serve as a reminder of a discount while the user makes purchasing decisions.

The merchant checkout page may include various web content that enables a user to view and enter order information and complete an order for goods services or both. For example the merchant checkout page may include an order information portion a shipping information portion a code entry portion and a checkout button . The order information portion enables a user to enter a shipping address a billing address payment information and the like. By selecting the checkout out button Place Your Order a user may submit an order for fulfillment by the merchant. The order information portion may include order information such as products or services in the order quantities prices payment information etc. and may include a button or other control for changing the order. Similarly the shipping information portion may include shipping address a billing address and other shipping information and may include a button or other control to enable a user to change the shipping information. The code entry portion may enable a user to enter coupon codes promotional codes gift card codes or any other codes that may be applied to an order. The code entry portion may include an input field e.g. a text field that receives text input and a submission button Apply . By entering a coupon code or other code into the input field and selecting the submission button a user may submit a coupon code to apply a coupon associated with the merchant. In some embodiments the input field may accept images or other input.

As shown below in a user may enter the value associated with the coupon code into the input field by pasting a value of the coupon code A from the clipboard into the input field . further depicts the screen and the checkout page illustrating entry of a coupon code value in the input field in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As mentioned above a value corresponding to the coupon code A may be copied to a clipboard or other temporary storage upon selection of the selected coupon. Thus a user may simply paste the contents of the clipboard into the input field to enter the coupon code value into the input field and a user does not need to memorize the coupon code or manually type the code directly into the input field . Alternatively a user may type or otherwise enter the coupon code value into the input field and may easily obtain the coupon code from the redemption header included in the checkout webpage . In other embodiments the input field may be automatically populated auto populated with the coupon code value . For example the code e.g. JavaScript associated with the redemption header may detect the input field when the code is executed as the redemption bar is loaded and the coupon code value may be automatically entered into the input field . Or the code may be loaded by such a script in response to a click event on an apply coupon button of the header or a click even on the coupon code. In some cases the header is reloaded with each merchant web page or executes a script with each loaded merchant web page to determine whether the web page is a checkout webpage in which the code may be applied e.g. by detecting the presence of keywords such as shipping information or checkout in the webpage or a portion of a URL of the webpage know to correspond with the merchant s checkout webpage.

In some embodiments a tag of other element including the input field may be detected to detect the input field such as an input element of type text within an HTML form element of a div box containing the string coupon or related keywords. In some cases other content may be conveyed and entered via the header content. For instance user shipping addresses billing information and the like may be retrieved from a user profile of the offers engine stored in non visible content of the header e.g. a JavaScript variable and entered by a script of the header in response to a request from the user e.g. in response to a user clicking an auto populate button. In yet other embodiments a merchant may specifically identify the webpage element of the input field or may identify the input field using a standardized identification. In some embodiments a checkout page identifier e.g. keywords a URL or the like may be stored in association with the merchant by the offers engine above and sent as an variable in the script or other code associated with the header such that the value can be referenced when a checkout page detection function is executed in response to a merchant webpage loading.

A user may then select the submission button to apply the coupon code to the order. Thus the coupon code may be entered into the input field by merely pasting the contents of a clipboard or other temporary storage into the input field or by auto populating the input field . After application of the coupon code A a user may submit the order to the merchant by selecting the checkout button .

Although are described with reference to an input field of a checkout webpage associated with a merchant it should be appreciated that the same techniques may apply to input fields located in any webpage associated with a merchant that may receive a coupon code and for which a user desired to enter the code. For example a shopping cart webpage a product webpage or other merchant webpages may have an input field that may be processed in the manner described above.

In some embodiments as shown in the redemption header may provide different content in response to changes in the webpage or web content displayed in the browser. For example after a different merchant webpage loads or web content within a merchant webpage changes the redemption header may change based on the different webpage or changed web content. An order confirmation page may be detected using techniques like those described above for detecting checkout pages e.g. executing a page classification script upon loading of each merchant webpage and determining based on keywords or URL attributes associated with the merchant in the header script and offers engine whether the webpage is a checkout page an order confirmation page or a shopping page. Upon detecting the order confirmation page the header of may be presented. depicts a screen of a browser illustrating an order confirmation webpage in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For example after a user submits an order such as from the checkout page depicted in a user may be presented with the order confirmation webpage . The order confirmation webpage may include order information and a Continue Shopping button . The order information may include a verification of order submission Order successful order information shipping information or any other information associated with an order. The Continue Shopping button may enable a user to navigate to additional webpages of the merchant website such as by returning to a merchant storefront or a product webpage.

As shown in in response to the loading of the order confirmation webpage the redemption header may include different content that may be based on the order confirmation webpage . As shown in the redemption header may include user feedback instructions Was coupon successful and feedback buttons . A user may indicate the success of the selected coupon by selecting the YES feedback button A and the failure of the selected coupon by selecting the NO feedback button B. Upon selection of one of the buttons A or B the selection may be transmitted to the offers engine a transmission which includes an identifier of the offer. In this manner user feedback regarding the success or failure of an online coupon or other offer may be collected and used for offer analysis offer ranking affiliate payments merchant payments or other purposes. In some embodiments after a user selects a feedback button the redemption header may be removed from the order confirmation webpage e.g. by a script or code of the header executed in response to a click event on one of the buttons A or B. In other embodiments the redemption header may remain on the order confirmation webpage and may again present different content based on user selection of another webpage e.g. by selecting the Continue Shopping button .

As mentioned above in some embodiments the loading of a different webpage in a browser may be detected. In such an embodiment for example the code associated with the redemption header may detect a POST a GET or other HTTP request method to detect the loading of a different webpage. Additionally the data included in the request method may be parsed and analyzed to determine the type of webpage requested. For example if an order confirmation webpage is detected e.g. based on a requested URL in a GET request then in response the user feedback text and feedback buttons may be provided in the redemption header . In other embodiments the asynchronous loading of different web content in a merchant webpage may be detected. In such an embodiment the merchant webpage may call a method that provides a message or other indication to the redemption header that different web content is loading. Such a method may be provided in an application programming interface API provided by the provider of the offers engine .

A user may then perform other user actions to interact with the redemption header and merchant webpages. For example a user may select the close control of the redemption header block and the selection of the close control may be received block . In response the redemption header may be removed from the merchant webpage block . A user may also search and browse a merchant website to purchase goods services or both associated with the coupon. Subsequently a user may navigate to a merchant webpage having an input field to complete an order for goods services or both such as a checkout webpage a shopping cart webpage or other merchant webpage block . A user may then paste a coupon code value from the clipboard or other temporary storage into the input field of the merchant webpage block . As described above and as illustrated in the input field may then be populated with the value of the coupon code of the selected coupon block . After the coupon code is entered into the input field a user may submit the coupon code for redemption and continue the checkout to complete the order block . As described above in redemption of offers such as a selected coupon may occur through an affiliate network or directly from a merchant.

As described above and as illustrated in the browser may be redirected to a merchant webpage block such as a landing webpage of a merchant website. For example the redirect request may request the merchant webpage from merchant servers and the merchant webpage may be provided to the browser from the merchant servers. Next code for a redemption header may be inserted into the merchant webpage block and this redemption header code may be executed by the browser during loading of the merchant webpage. In some embodiments the redemption header code may include JavaScript and may be inserted as a HTML tag. In such embodiments the redemption header code may be inserted asynchronously via JavaScript provided by the offers engine such as JavaScript provided in the offers website having the selectable offer. As described above in some embodiments the offers engine may include a content delivery network CDN and the redemption header code and other static content associated with the redemption header may be served via the CDN. Additionally the size of the redemption header code may be minimized or reduced to optimize or improve the transmission and loading time of the redemption header code.

Next a webpage element for the redemption header may be created in the merchant webpage block such as in a document object model DOM associated with the merchant webpage. For example in some embodiments an inline frame may be created via the HTML tag. In such embodiments the redemption header code may load content from the offers engine within the inline frame. Additionally the redemption header code may use a relatively unique namespace to avoid conflicts with other elements. Thus in some embodiments nodes or other elements inserted into the DOM of a merchant webpage may be associated with a unique namespace to eliminate conflicts with existing elements. The process continues in as shown by connector block A.

After reading the offer identifier the requester of the redemption header may be compared to an expected domain to determine if the requester matches the expected domain block . For example the domain of the merchant website requesting the redemption header may be compared to the expected merchant domain associated with the offer identifier for the offer. If there is a match between the requester and the expected domain line then the redemption header may be provided to the browser block . As described above the providing may include providing images text and other components that form the redemption header to the browser. In some embodiments the static content such as images and text associated with the redemption header may be provided from a CDN e.g. a CDN having a cookieless domain and may be compressed to optimize transmission and loading time. Additionally in some embodiments the size and number of content associated with the redemption header may be minimized to facilitate faster transmission and loading time.

The redemption header may be then be displayed by the browser in the webpage element created for the redemption header block . As discussed above the redemption header may be displayed in the merchant webpage such as in a header portion of the merchant webpage. If there is not a match between the requester and the expected domain line then an empty webpage element may be provided block and no redemption header is included in the merchant webpage.

As described above after the redemption header is provided a user may select the close control to remove the redemption header from the merchant webpage. In such embodiments a message may be asynchronously provided to remove the redemption header and the associated webpage element from the merchant webpage and to remove the browser accessible storage item. The redemption header may remain removed from the merchant webpage until the user returns to the offers webpage and selects a new offer.

In other embodiments the merchant website may be provided in an inline frame of the offers website provided by the offers engine . For example when a user selects an offer the offers website may load another webpage having the redemption header. A merchant webpage may then be asynchronously loaded in an inline frame of the webpage such that the redemption header is still visually displayed with the merchant webpage. In such embodiments the user may interact with the merchant website and redemption header in the manner described above. Additionally merchant webpages may be loaded in the inline frame and the redemption header may remain on the webpage as the user navigates the merchant website.
