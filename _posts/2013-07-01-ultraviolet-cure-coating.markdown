This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 668 740 titled Ultra Violet Cure Coating filed on Jul. 6 2012 the entire contents which are hereby incorporated by reference herein including all attachments and other documents that were incorporated by reference in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 668 740.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates to curable compositions that can be used as a protective layer a paint or other coating. More specifically coating compositions are provided that include multiple curing modalities to improve cure times and coating performance for several applications illustratively camouflage paints.

Materials that can be used to provide electro optical signature reduction termed low observable coatings are desirable for use in military vehicles to provide resistance to visibility in both the visual and or infrared spectrums. Prior camouflage Chemical Agent Resistant Coatings CARC were developed to address low visibility needs in the visual and near infrared IR bands. For example the three color woodland pattern and the desert tan match the visual effects of the background and in the near IR the green color matches the sharp reflectance rise of chlorophyll present in all green foliage. In 1985 CARC became the standard camouflage coating for the Army as MIL C 46168 based on a two component urethane consisting of a aliphatic diisocyanate and a saturated polyester.

Unfortunately the original CARC materials were deemed unsuitable for continued use due to poor performance and high volatile organic content VOC resulting from the use of the materials used in the formulation of CARC. In response a water dispersible CARC was formulated as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 691 410. While this material addressed the environmental concerns it has become increasingly clear that the long dry times required for cure of these CARC materials is a detriment to their wide scale use.

The following summary of the invention is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the invention can be gained by taking the entire specification claims drawings and abstract as a whole.

Compositions suitable for coating a substrate such as those used in military hunting or other application for which low visibility is desired are provided. The water dispersible low observable coatings provided herein are environmentally acceptable rapid curing and provide superior performance. A water dispersible low observable curable composition includes an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin and one or more low solar absorbing pigments. In some embodiments the acrylate resin present at less than 50 total resin weight. Preferred pigments include those that are cobalt free do not absorb significant UV radiation during cure and provide reduced surface temperature resulting in low IR signature. Illustrative pigments include chromium oxide green magnesium ferrite red iron oxide FeO black iron oxide FeO zinc ferrite ZnFeO or combinations thereof.

The following description of particular embodiment s is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention its application or uses which may of course vary. The invention is described with relation to the non limiting definitions and terminology included herein. These definitions and terminology are not designed to function as a limitation on the scope or practice of the invention but are presented for illustrative and descriptive purposes only. While the compositions are described as using specific materials in a particular order it is appreciated that described materials or order may be interchangeable such that the description of the invention includes multiple parts or steps arranged in many ways as is readily appreciated by one of skill in the art.

A low observable coating composition is provided that allows rapid curing. In certain desirable embodiments the coating compositions of the present invention provide hard chemically resistant coated surfaces that are useful for low optical detection applications such as military vehicles. Thus the invention has utility as a low observable coating.

Generally the composition includes an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin and one or more low solar absorbing pigments.

Preferably the aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin is a polyurethane resin with hydroxyl functionality that is dispersible in water. Illustrative examples of an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin include those based on high molecular weight polyols known from standard polyurethane chemistry illustratively those with molecular weights of 400 to 6 000 Da optionally 400 to 3 000 Da. Numerous examples of such molecules are known in the art illustratively as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 194 487. Specific examples of polyols useful for the formation of an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane include polyhydroxy polyesters obtained from polyhydric alcohols to which trihydric alcohols may be added and polybasic carboxylic acids polylactones such as polymers of caprolactone initiated with a polyhydric alcohol polycarbonates containing hydroxyl groups polyethers polyether esters containing isocyanate reactive group polythioethers polyacetals polyester amides and polyamides. In some embodiments hydroxyl functional polyurethane dispersions are the ambient cure resin sold as Bayhydrol XP 7110E or Bayhydrol XP 2591 from Bayer Material Science Pittsburgh Pa.

An aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin is optionally combined with a first crosslinking agent. A crosslinking agent is optionally a water dispersible polyisocyanate. An aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin optionally has a hydroxy functionality of at least 1.8 optionally 1.8 to 8 optionally 2 to 6 or optionally 2.5 to 6 a total content of urethane and urea groups of 9 to 20 by weight optionally about 10 to 17 by weight and an average hydroxy equivalent weight which may be calculated by an end group analysis of about 100 to 5000 optionally 500 to 4000 or optionally 1000 to 3000. A water dispersible aliphatic polyisocyanate material is optionally based on hexamethylene diisocyanate HDI where the isocyanate functional group NCO content ranges from 18.95 to 19.45 percent and which has an equivalent weight average of 220 Da. Illustrative polyurethane resins include but are not limited to the polyurethane resins described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 194 487.

The hydroxy functional polyurethanes are formed by reacting one or more organic polyisocyanates with one or more high molecular weight polyols optionally low molecular weight isocyanate reactive compounds wherein at least one of isocyanate reactive compounds contains anionic or potential anionic groups and isocyanate reactive compounds containing nonionic hydrophilic groups.

A low observable coating composition also includes an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin.

Nos. 7 041 708 and 7 396 875 and particularly U.S. Patent Application Publication No 2012 0041145.

An aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin is optionally formed of A one or more compounds of monohydroxy functional alcohols containing meth acrylate groups B polyester polyols obtainable from aliphatic diols having 2 to 4 carbon atoms between the two OH functions and or aliphatic triols or aromatic di and or tricarboxylic acids and C one or more compounds having at least one group which is reactive towards isocyanate and additionally groups which are nonionic ionic or capable of the formation of ionic groups which have a dispersing action for the polyurethane dispersion.

Urethane acrylate resin is optionally provided with a second crosslinking agent. A second crosslinking agent optionally includes one or more polyisocyanates chosen from the group of aromatic araliphatic aliphatic or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates or mixtures of such polyisocyanates. Suitable polyisocyanates are for example 1 3 cyclohexane diisocyanate 1 methyl 2 4 diisocyanato cyclohexane 1 methyl 2 6 diisocyanato cyclohexane tetramethylene diisocyanate 4 4 diisocyanatodiphenylmethane 2 4 diisocyanatodiphenylmethane 2 4 diisocyanatotoluene 2 6 diisocyanatotoluene tetramethyl m or p xylylene diisocyanate 1 6 hexamethylene diisocyanate 1 isocyanato 3 3 5 trimethyl 5 isocyanatomethylcyclohexane isophorone diisocyanate or IPDI 4 4 diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane 4 isocyanatomethyl 1 8 octane diisocyanate triisocyanatononane TIN EP A 928 799 and mixtures thereof.

Homologues and oligomers of 1 isocyanato 3 3 5 trimethyl 5 isocyanatomethylcyclohexane isophorone diisocyanate or IPDI and 4 4 diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane with biuret carbodiimide isocyanurate allophanate iminooxadiazinedione and or uretdione groups mixtures thereof with one another and mixtures with the preferred polyisocyanates listed above are likewise preferred.

Other materials are optionally included in an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin such as those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012 0041145.

An optional aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin that can optionally be used in the present invention is sold under the name of Bayhydrol XP 2690 and is available from Bayer Materials Sciences Pittsburgh Pa.

In some embodiments the urethane acrylate resin is present at less than 50 by weight of the total resin e.g. total weight of the hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin and the aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin optionally between 10 and 50 or any value or range therebetween. The urethane acrylate resin is optionally present at from 20 to 45 optionally from 35 to 40 by weight of the total resin. It was unexpectedly discovered that the presence of a relatively low amount of acrylate resin promotes curing of the entire composition upon exposure to UV light even though the UV curable portion of the material is in the minority. Prior to experimental curing it was believed that the presence of the acrylate resin would enhance the hardness of the material after the UV curing time but full or otherwise functional hardness would not be achieved until proper curing of the ambient cure material by full reaction with the a crosslinker such as a polyisocyanate. Of greater surprise was the realization that promoting the cure of the hydroxyl functionalized material such as by the addition of heat without UV light resulted in a material that failed to cure even though the ambient cure resin material is at a relative majority. The material resulting from heat curing absent UV light was of such poor hardness and incomplete cure that hardness or solvent resistant testing traditional test for cure level were not able to be performed.

A low observable coating composition includes one or more e.g. a plurality of low solar absorbing pigments. It was discovered that not all pigments are suitable for inclusion in a coating composition as claimed herein. A low solar absorbing pigment has properties that do not interfere with radiation in the UV spectrum thus allowing the UV radiation to be available to activate the photo initiation process necessary for cure of the UV curable urethane acrylate resin. Thus a low solar absorbing pigment must meet two criteria for use. First the material must be low solar absorbing to impart low observability to the resulting coating material in the visual and near IR bands. Second the pigment must not interfere with activation of the photoinitiator required for UV cure.

Illustrative examples of low solar absorbing pigments include but are not limited to certain metal oxides including one or more guest components that preserve the crystalline structure charge and cation sites of the host component lattice structure. Illustrative examples of metal oxides include but are not limited to those that have a corundum hematite crystalline structure illustratively iron or chromium. A guest component is illustratively aluminum antimony bismuth boron chrome cobalt gallium indium iron lanthanum lithium magnesium manganese molybdenum neodymium nickel niobium silicon tin titanium vanadium zinc or combinations thereof. These and other examples of low solar absorbing pigments are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 454 848.

A low solar absorbing pigment is a pigment that will provide chroma hue and saturation for a camouflage green black tan or other desired color. For example chrome oxides are optionally used in a camouflage green to simulate the chlorophyll reflectance curve detected in the near infrared region. Iron oxides may be used to impart a visual brown color to the resulting composition. Illustrative specific examples of a low solar absorbing pigment may be described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 454 848. Illustrative specific examples of pigments include but are not limited to chromium oxide magnesium ferrite MgFeO red iron oxide FeO black iron oxide FeO zinc ferrite ZnFeO and combinations thereof. Specific examples of low solar absorbing pigments include but are not limited to chromium oxide e.g. Chromium Oxide Green GX 1005 or G 8599 zinc ferrite e.g. Tan 20 A red iron oxide FeO e.g. Red Iron Oxide 2199 D black iron oxide FeO e.g. V 775 Cool color IR Black and combinations thereof.

The resulting pigmentation can be optionally changed or altered to account for specific camouflage applications and or scenarios as desired. Exact chroma hue saturation and other characteristics of the respective colors may be found in the military specification entitled Coating Aliphatic Polyurethanes Chemical Agent Resistant MIL C 46168D ME 21 May 1987 listed in Section 1.2.1 Colors and more definitely in Table V titled Pigmentation and throughout MIL DTL 64159 and particularly Tables I and III VI.

A low solar absorbing pigment is present in an amount sufficient to provide low observability to an article coated with the composition. Illustratively a low solar absorbing pigment is preset at 0.1 to 40 wt percent of the composition. It is appreciated that the amount of low solar absorbing pigment is dependent on the desired final color or other spectral characteristics of the resulting composition.

A water dispersible low observable curable composition may include one or more additional materials to adjust the flow settling adhesion dispersion defoaming photoinitiation or other characteristic of the composition.

A photoinitiator is optionally any molecule sufficient to effect free radical polymerization of meth acrylate double bonds for polymerization induced by radiation chemistry. Illustrative examples include but are not limited to those suitable for promoting curing at a wavelength of less than 400 nm such as mediated by UV electron x or gamma rays. UV radiation is particularly preferred in the presence of one or more photoinitiators. A distinction is made in principle between two types of photoinitiators the unimolecular type I and the bimolecular type II . Suitable type I systems are aromatic ketone compounds such as e.g. benzophenones in combination with tertiary amines alkylbenzophenones 4 4 bis dimethylamino benzophenone Michler s ketone anthrone and halogenated benzophenones or mixtures of the types mentioned. Type II initiators such as benzoin and its derivatives benzil ketals acylphosphine oxides 2 4 6 trimethyl benzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide bisacylphosphine oxides phenylglyoxylic acid esters camphorquinone aminoalkylphenones dialkoxyacetophenones and hydroxyalkylphenones are also suitable. Photoinitiators that are readily incorporated into aqueous coating compositions are preferred. Such products include but are not limited to Irgacure 500 a mixture of benzophenone and 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone Ciba Lampertheim DE Irgacure 819 DW phenyl bis 2 4 6 trimethylbenzoyl phosphine oxide Ciba Lampertheim DE and Esacure KIP EM oligo 2 hydroxy 2 methyl 1 4 1 methylvinyl phenyl propanone Lamberti Aldizzate Italy . Mixtures of these compounds can also be employed. A photoinitiator is optionally present at 0.5 2.0 weight percent optionally from 1 3 weight percent.

A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes a supplementary crosslinking agent as a part ii that is optionally a water dispersible polyisocyanate in addition to any isocyanate material included in either an aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin or an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin. Illustrative examples of a supplementary polyisocyanate include but are not limited to the polyisocyanates described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 200 489. A supplementary crosslinking agent is optionally present from 4 to 55 weight percent.

A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes one or more flattening agents such as polymeric beads. Illustrative examples of polymeric beads include beads made of polyurea or polyurethane optionally with a median particle size of 18 m. Beads are optionally spherical vesiculated type materials with enhanced matting properties and are extremely chemical resistant. A flattening agent is optionally present at from 5 15 weight percent optionally 5 10 weight percent optionally 7 9 weight percent.

A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes one or more pigment dispersing aids. A pigment dispersing aide is optionally preset at from 0.1 to 1 weight percent or other amount as is suitable. Illustrative examples of a pigment dispersing aid include but are not limited to the polymeric dispersants such as those sold under the tradename SOLSPERSE 20000 sold by Lubrizol Advanced Materials Inc. Wickliffe Ohio and Troysol AFP from Troy Corp. Florham Park N.J.

A water dispersible low observable curable composition optionally includes one or more defoaming agents. A defoaming agent is suitable for use as an agent for aqueous dispersions. A defoaming agent is optionally a silicone or silicone free system. When present a defoaming agent is optionally included at 0.1 to 1.0 percent by weight percent optionally 0.1 to 0.5 weight percent optionally 0.1 to 0.3 weight percents Illustrative examples include but are not limited to the defoaming agents sold as BYK 023 available from BYK USA Inc. Wallingford Conn.

The coatings can optionally contain other additives and raw materials including but not limited to catalysts surfactants adhesion and crosslinking agents flow and wetting agents solvents e.g. water etc. thickening agents suspension agents strength enhancing agents and so forth. The coatings can be applied to any substrate such as metal plastic wood glass etc. Additives are included at levels understood by those of skill in the art to impart the desired characteristics.

It is appreciated that other additives may be present as is determined beneficial by one of skill in the art.

Various aspects of the present invention are illustrated by the following non limiting examples. The examples are for illustrative purposes and are not a limitation on any practice of the present invention. It will be understood that variations and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. A person of ordinary skill in the art readily understands where any and all necessary reagents may be commercially obtained.

Water dispersible low observable compositions are formulated as a combination of two master mixes with Master Mix A formulated as in Table 2 using various amounts and pigment types.

Master Mix B is prepared by mixing a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent with solvent and water. The NCO to hydroxyl functional polyurethane OH ratio can range from 1.5 to 10 or 4 to 55 .

Master Mix A and B are then combined by gentle mixing and the resulting formulation applied to a substrate and subjected to UV and ambient curing. Formulations are cured using a H S Autoshot 1200 W UVA light held at an 8 inch or 14 inch stand off distance depending on the formulation from the coated surfaces for 10 minutes. Stand off distance of the UVA lamp and duration of UVA exposure can be varied depending on desired degree of cure. Coatings are ready to handle within ten minutes of spraying compared to 6 8 hours required for current ambient cure CARC and exhibits MEK resistance within 24 hours compared to approximately 7 days required for ambient cure CARC.

Additional formulas are prepared as in Table 2 using various ratios of aqueously dispersed hydroxyl functional polyurethane resin e.g. Bayhydrol XP7110 and an aqueously dispersed urethane acrylate resin e.g. Bayhydrol XP 2690 as listed in Table 3.

Each of Formulas D X demonstrate excellent dry and handling characteristics similar to Formulas A C. Formulas F O show particularly superior dry and handling characteristics.

Formulations A X are prepared as in Example 1 and coated onto cold rolled steel pretreated with zinc phosphate coating Bonderite 952 and sealed with Parcolene 60 chrome sealer. These panels are 0.032 inches 0.8128 mm thick. For flexibility tests tinplated steel panels 0.010 inches 0.254 mm thick are used. The panels are coated by spraying with each formulation unless otherwise noted.

Immediately after the coating is applied the coated panels are placed in a spray booth for 10 minutes to allow flash off of water and solvent and then placed under the UVA lamp for curing. The UVA lamp used to cure the panels is a H S Autoshot 1200 W UVA light held at an 8 inch or 14 inch stand off distance depending on the formulation and specified in the discussion from the paint surfaces. Panels are exposed to the UVA light for 10 minutes.

The coated panels are subjected to a series of tests as per Table 4 and MIL DTL 53072D paragraph 4.2.3.2 Solvent Wipe. 

Drying results for ambient cure and UV activated CARC is shown in Table 5 comparing traditional CARC of U.S. Pat. No. 5 691 410 Ambient Cure CARC . Drying is monitored between 15 minutes and 300 minutes following removal of the panels from the UV lamp. Designations of different dry characteristics are given based on criteria listed in ASTM D 5895 03 Reapproved 2008 Evaluating Drying and Curing. The designations are as follows SST set to touch light finger pressure does not leave imprint DH dry hard forcible pinch does not leave imprint DT dry through press and twist using thumb does not leave imprint.

Ambient cure water dispersible CARC requires 72 hours for DT properties and 7 days for final cure. Therefore the results shown in Table 5 CARC air dry are expected in that the ambient cure CARC remained wet for over two hours and did not achieve STT for 4 hours. Even after 4 hours the coating remained very soft and could not be handled without damage to the coating surface. When ambient cure CARC is placed under the UV lamp for 10 minutes it s drying is accelerated and the STT property is observed after 45 minutes. After about 3 hours the coating exhibited dry properties.

All three UV activated coatings exhibited STT properties within 15 minutes of removal from the UV lamp. Thus the UV cure coatings exhibit an accelerated dry time compared to the ambient cure CARC. UV4 exhibited a complete dry within 45 minutes. UV2 was not monitored beyond three hours and did not achieve a complete dry time within three hours. UV3 was not monitored beyond 90 minutes and although it was almost completely dry it did not achieve DH status within that time. Drying results are illustrated in Table 6.

Dry characteristics shown in Table 6 specifically describe the dry surface characteristics of paint that can be helpful in determining sufficient drying for varying degrees of handling of a coated part however it does not indicate more advanced crosslinking or cure of the coating. MEK resistance is an aggressive test in which a cloth saturated with MEK is rubbed repeatedly across the surface of the coating over the same area. Rubbing across and back over the same surface for one cycle is designated as a double rub dr . MIL DTL 53072 criteria for this test is a minimum of 20 dr without removing paint down to the previous coated surface or bare substrate on a panel that has been allowed to cure in ambient conditions for 7 days. Table 7 shows MEK resistance after 3 hours 24 hours 48 hours and 7 days for UV cured coatings and standard water dispersible CARC.

Pencil hardness was also taken before and after the MEK rubs to determine the degree of softening following MEK exposure. Ambient cure CARC required 24 hours of dry time to perform the MEK resistance test. Although 50 dr was achieved the sample was relatively soft and softened further to level HB after MEK exposure. After 48 hours 100 dr was achieved on the standard CARC however the pencil hardness decreased by 5 units from 8H to 3H . The criteria described within MIL DTL 64159 for immersion resistance water and hydrocarbon and super tropical bleach allow a decrease of no more than 2 pencil hardness units. This criterion was also used for MEK resistance. Full MEK resistance was achieved on the standard CARC after 7 day cure time. As was observed in Table 6 standard CARC placed under the UV lamp for 10 minutes exhibited accelerated drying. This formula achieved MEK resistance maintaining pencil hardness values after 48 hours of dry time. UV2 exhibits similar values to standard CARC. UV3 and UV4 exhibit MEK resistance within 24 hours with retention of hardness values and UV4 exhibits some resistance to MEK after only 3 hours although below specification criteria. Enhanced solvent resistance of paints is generally related to increased crosslinking within the coating. Seo J. 2010 

Curing efficiency with UV light is based on numerous factors with the parameters of the light source including wavelength intensity and dosage of primary importance. Strazisar 2006 Light intensity at the coating surface termed irradiance is essential in order to optimize cure conditions and maintain consistency in cure results. UV lamp irradiance experiments and the effect on cure was performed. For these evaluations cure criteria was defined by pencil hardness and MEK resistance both measurements taken within minutes following 10 minutes of UV irradiation. Lamp intensity measurements at the coating surface were taken using a Solarlight PMA 2100 radiometer. Results are presented in Table 8.

A stand off distance of 14 inches with an exposure time of 15 minutes results in a low lamp intensity at the coating surface 30 mW cm2 . This irradiance level resulted in a soft coating with no MEK resistance immediately following lamp exposure. The data shown in Table 8 indicates cure development of the coatings of UV4 within minutes of UV lamp exposure thereby indicating the ability of the UV activated chemistry to achieve a relatively high degree of crosslinking in that short time. It was determined that a stand off distance of 8 inches and an exposure time of 10 minutes resulting in moderate lamp intensity 74 mW cm2 resulted in sufficient hardness and MEK resistance and was used in all subsequent UV cure processes described below. It was also noteworthy that the black coating achieved significantly higher hardness compared to the 808 green suggesting that the pigmentation of the black sample exhibited less interference with the UV light perhaps resulting in better UV cure efficiency.

Table 9 shows paint properties of UV4 cured at an 8 inch stand off distance for 10 minutes under the UV lamp compared with ambient cured CARC and standard CARC exposed to the UV lamp using the same conditions as the UV activated formulation. Pendulum hardness was measured with the BYK Gardner Pendulum Hardness Tester Category number 5854 which is designed to test according to ASTM D4366 and ISO 1522. Pendulum hardness results using the Konig method are reported here. The Konig method uses a tapered pendulum pulled back to 6 from center 0 and measures the number of oscillations until the pendulum is dampened to a degree of less than 3 in tandem with a calibrated timer which is controlled by the operator.

All formulations utilized the same LSA black pigment package. The data in Table 9 is different from earlier data in three significant ways. It is a modified formulation based on LSA black pigments it was cured with a shorter 8 inch stand off distance from the UV lamp and testing was initiated immediately following lamp exposure and compared to samples allowed to sit at room temperature for 7 days.

The data in Table 9 shows that ambient cure CARC that had been exposed to the UVA lamp for 10 minutes and tested immediately after returning to room temperature was still soft and under cured compared to the UV4 coatings exposed to the same conditions. The ambient cure CARC was too soft to measure pencil hardness and exhibited low pendulum hardness values. The paint was easily removed from the surface when rubbed with MEK. Also the sample failed the water immersion test exhibiting severe blistering. Although UV4 also showed soft pencil hardness it was at least 3 pencil units harder than the CARC and the pendulum hardness was twice that of the ambient cure CARC. Also UV4 exhibited excellent MEK resistance and no blisters or change in hardness after the water immersion test. As expected when both materials are allowed to sit for 7 days at room temperature they both see further development in properties. Particularly hardness continues to improve over time. After the 7 day period both coatings become indistinguishable with the exception that UV4 exhibited slightly higher hardness. Interestingly gloss does not seem to be affected by the cure time and remained consistent for both formulations.

The formulations of prior used CARC and the material of UV4 are tested by artificial weathering. UV exposure testing was performed using a Q Lab QUV Spray instrument. Florescent bulbs were used that emitted light at 340 nm wavelength at an irradiance of 0.77 watts per square meter W m . This method involves alternating cycles of 8 hours light at 60 C. and 4 hours dark at 50 C. Data was taken at 300 hour intervals up to 1200 hours total.

Table 10 shows gloss and color change of CARC and UV4 as a function of weathering in the QUV chamber.

In the 1200 hours of QUV testing both coating formulations retained gloss and color within the allowance of MIL DTL 64159 gloss maximum 60 85 1.0 3.5 and color change E 

Table 11 shows pencil hardness of both UV4 and CARC exposed to 10 minutes of UVA radiation and evaluated at different time intervals following removal from the UVA lamp. Within 10 minutes following UV exposure allowing the panels to cool enough to handle both samples were soft. However the CARC sample was softer than the lowest pencil value of 6B. UV4 exhibited a higher hardness value of at least 3 pencil units. UV4 hardness developed more quickly than the UV exposed CARC sample and the two coatings exhibited the same hardness values after about 72 hours. Full hardness values were achieved after 7 days.

Pendulum hardness values were also measured and are shown in Table 12. With this technique the hardness of a coated surface is measured by tracking the dampening effect the coated surface has on an oscillating pendulum. This method consists of placing two stainless steel balls on the coated surface. The balls act as the pivot point at the top of a pendulum. The pendulum is swung from a fixed start position and the number of swings is counted. Softer surfaces will dampen more quickly and thus swing fewer times. The oscillations and seconds measured are taken as the hardness of the coating.

The trend in pendulum hardness is similar to that seen for pencil hardness. Both coatings continue to develop hardness over time however UV4 exhibits significantly higher hardness values following UVA radiation exposure. Pendulum hardness of standard black ambient cure CARC that was several months old was tested for comparison. This CARC sample represents a fully cured coating. UV4 exhibits similar pendulum hardness as the control after 14 days. Asif et al. report that pendulum hardness is related to crosslink density and inter chain interactions within polyurethane networks. Asif 2005 Thus the accelerated development of pendulum hardness seen for UV4 suggests that the UV cure formulation has higher crosslink density soon after UVA exposure compared to the CARC coating which correlates with the MEK resistance and enhanced drying characteristics observed for the UV cure formulation.

Mechanical properties of the coatings of various formulations were measured using a DMA 2980 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer TA Instruments . DMA measures the viscoelastic response of polymers under a small cyclic strain with respect to temperature. The sensitivity of the viscoelastic response of polymers makes this a good technique to elucidate structure property relationships of the polymer. Neag 1995 A fully formulated paint with pigments and additives is a complex system that can convolute the viscoelastic response. To simplify the system and to ascertain contributions from polymer chain interactions on the viscoelastic properties unfilled clear coatings were used for DMA. These clear compositions for testing are formulated as in Table 13.

A film clamp adapter was calibrated according to the TA instruments calibration routine. Once mounted in the tension film clamp samples were equilibrated at 20 C. for 5 min followed by a programmed temperature ramp from 20 to 180 C. at 2 C. min using a constant oscillatory frequency of 1 Hz.

The results of DMA testing are presented in . illustrate the storage modulus for clear films of Table 13 after 2 days following coating application and 7 days following coating application respectively. For these experiments unsupported free films were used. The UV cure samples were cured using UV light as explained earlier in the report. However the CARC samples prepared for the DMA experiment were not exposed to UV light and instead allowed to cure according to the standard ambient cure process. A minimum of 2 days was required for the CARC coatings to have adequate film properties to be removed from the substrate a free films.

Storage modulus E is associated with energy stored in the material as a result of the applied strain and is related to the material stiffness. E can provide information related to molecular weight degree of cure and crosslink density. Asif 2005 Skrovanekek D. 1988 The DMA data show a marked difference between the UV cure coatings and ambient cure CARC particularly after 2 days following coating application. The three UV cure formulations UV2 UV3 and UV4 show a higher E compared to ambient cure CARC indicating a higher crosslink density and greater degree of cure than the CARC sample. After 7 days following coating application E for all four coatings exhibit similar values but the greatest change is seen in the standard CARC coating which showed a significant improvement in E across in both the glassy and rubbery plateau regions. This is direct confirmation that the ambient cure CARC requires 7 days for full development of crosslink density and that the UV cure formulations achieve crosslink density and greater degree of cure much sooner following coating application. Even after 7 days E is lower for the ambient cure CARC in the glassy region of the curve.

Tan delta tan the ratio of loss modulus to storage modulus E E is shown in . The temperature associated with the peak magnitude of tan is defined as the glass transition temperature T. Height and width of tan peaks are related to structural homogeneity and crosslink density. Koleske 2012 The tan curves shown in reflect significant differences between the four coatings 2 days following coating application. The UV cure coatings exhibited increasing T reduction in peak magnitude and increased broadening with respect to increasing UV component in the formulation. The T s for UV2 UV3 and UV4 were 46.2 C. 54.5 C. and 60.2 C. respectively. As the relative degree of crosslinking increases in a sample the free volume and mobility of chain ends decrease resulting in an increase in T. Skrovanek 1988 Thus crosslinking increases in the UV cure coatings as a function of increasing UV component after 2 days following coating application. Tan peak broadening was also observed with increasing UV activated chemistry. Broad Tregions are generally indicative of molecular heterogeneity arising from contributions of multiple reactions. Skrovanek 1988 Introduction of crosslinks also reduces tan peak magnitude and increases peak width. Kolske 2012 Tan of UV4 in particular indicates a greater degree of crosslinking compared to standard CARC indicating a more advanced state of cure at a time of 2 days following sample preparation. Standard water dispersible CARC following 2 days of ambient cure time is clearly under cured as reflected in the 2 distinct transitions at 14.5 C. and 55.8 C. Prior work by Crawford and Escarsega showed that tan for standard CARC exhibited a single well defined peak with a Tof 73 F. measured 10 days post cure. Crawford 2000 .

The kinetics of the UV initiated reaction in non pigmented thin films on a ZnSe crystal was monitored using the ATR FTIR spectroscopy. These studies were performed using a Nexus 870 Thermo Nicolet FTIR modified with a Gateway ATR accessory Specac . The bench was allowed to purge with dry nitrogen for 10 minutes prior to collecting a background spectrum of the ZnSe crystal mounted in the accessory. Polymer films were cast onto the crystal by placing a drop at one end of the crystal tilting the top plate of the accessory nearly normal to the benchtop and allowing the drop to run across the surface of the entire crystal. Excess polymer was wiped from the trough plate assembly and the plate was quickly placed onto the ATR accessory through the sliding window in the FTIR sample compartment. The spectrum was the summation of 32 scans collected between 650 and 4000 cmat 2 cmresolution.

These data are collected using compositions representative of Formulations A X that were cast from a blend of ambient cure polyol material isocyanate and UV curable component. The spectra collected were normalized to the C H stretch at 2928 cm. As seen in a decrease in the C C stretching band at 810 cmat different UV exposure times indicates a reaction between the acrylate end groups and the photoinitiator near the interface of the thin polymer film and the crystal surface indicating that the UV initiated cure is proceeding. There is an obvious decrease in the intensity of the acrylate C C peak after only 30 seconds of exposure time. The intensity of the C C peak does not decrease significantly with longer exposure times and does not completely disappear from the spectrum exposed for 10 minutes to UV radiation. Without being limited to one particular theory the remaining acrylate functionality may be due to a decrease in mobility of the acrylate terminus and or photoninitiator as the cross linking reaction proceeds. Likewise the concentration of photoinitiator in the region probed by ATR FTIR may also be depleted. Depth profile experiments performed by van der Berg also showed residual C C using ATR FTIR for UV curable polyurethanes exposed to 10 minutes of UVA irradiation. van der Berg 2008 Yang et. al used real time FTIR to show that C C conversion increases rapidly within the first 1 2 minutes of the coatings exposure to UV light. Yang 2010 Both papers confirm our findings of acrylate double bond conversion as a result of UV cure.

All camouflage coatings use a mixture of mixed metal oxides to impart color and provide camouflage properties. The current 383 camouflage green uses a combination of chrome oxide and cobalt spinel to both replicate foliage background in the visible 400 nm 700 nm and in the near IR spectra 750 nm 900 nm . The standard black formulation utilizes a combination of black iron oxide and or carbon black to impart color. The reflectance spectra for these coatings are shown in . Standard black has very low reflectance of approximately 4 across the entire spectrum. Standard green 383 has low reflectance 15 in the region of 1300 1700 nm. Additionally cobalt spinel is a foreign import with significant cost increases 300 in recent years and cobalt it is in free form has been identified as a hazardous air pollutant HAP by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA warranting initiatives to reduce or eliminate it.

The long term stability of camouflage coatings is directly related to the degree of exposure to sunlight temperature extremes and humidity. The amount of solar absorption that a surface is subject to is directly related to the reflectivity of the coating system in both the visible and the near IR region of the spectrum. To lower the solar absorption in the non visible IR pigment and nanometer scale additives to the color formulations have been developed. The low reflectance values of the standard pigmented coatings shown in indicate the high solar loading that coatings with these pigments impart.

Reflectance values for the UV4 formulation utilizing LSA pigments for both black and green are also shown in . The UV cure formulations exhibited significantly higher reflectance values in the near IR region of 700 to 1000 nm where half of the solar loading occurs. Reflectance values in that region increased from approximately 50 to 64 for the green formulations and from 4 up to 20 for the black pigmented coating as measured by a Varian 5000 Spectrophotometer with an integrated sphere. Use of LSA pigmentation for the dark coatings resulted in reflectance values that approximate a much lighter visual color such as the 686A TAN in the near IR as can be seen in and therefore reduce the solar loading of the dark pigmented paint. Thermal measurements taken on coated panels under heat lamps showed a reduction of 12 F. 15 F. of the LSA pigmented coatings compared to standard pigmented control panels. This is a significant reduction of surface temperature based only on the pigmentation of the CARC system. As an added benefit the LSA pigments enable a successful rapid cure UV activated coating because the high reflectance properties of the LSA pigments do not interfere with UV radiation during the cure process thus allowing the UV radiation to initiate the photo cure process leading to a rapid crosslinking of the coating and the subsequent physical properties. The LSA pigments are essential to the rapid cure properties of the UV cure formulation and additionally result in low solar loading for dark pigmented coatings while also addressing elimination of cobalt in paint as directed by the EPA.
