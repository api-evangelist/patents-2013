Aspects of the disclosure relate to converged infrastructure computing technology and more particularly to a system method apparatus and computer program product for determining a configuration of a converged infrastructure.

Converged infrastructure computing is rapidly gaining in popularity as more and more entities deploying IT platforms are choosing to deploy converged infrastructure systems as part of an integrated information technology IT solution. In this regard converged infrastructure packages multiple IT components such as servers data storage devices networking equipment and software for IT infrastructure management into a single optimized computing solution. The integrated solution provided by a converged infrastructure can reduce complexity of deployment increase IT infrastructure reliability and reduce management costs compared to conventional IP platforms assembled from individually acquired and assembled components and software packages as converged infrastructure can provide an integrated set of components selected and assembled by a single vendor into an integrated platform providing guaranteed component interoperability and software compliance. Moreover converged infrastructure can provide an integrated pool of computing storage and networking resources e.g. a cloud based computing model that can be shared by multiple applications and or users.

While a converged infrastructure acquired from a vendor can provide an integrated IT solution individual converged infrastructure configurations vary such that an individual maintaining upgrading and or otherwise servicing a converged infrastructure may not know the configuration of the converged infrastructure e.g. what is contained in the converged infrastructure . In this regard converged infrastructure vendors often offer multiple models each of which may have a different configuration and often upgrade and tweak component configurations within a model over the life cycle of the model. Further customers deploying converged infrastructures may implement their own on site modifications to a converged infrastructure such as through software upgrades and or the addition of new hardware components. Lack of knowledge of the configuration of a converged infrastructure often presents difficulties when looking to upgrade software and or hardware components of the converged infrastructure as an IT technician may need to ensure that the desired upgrade is compatible with the existing configuration in order to ensure continued interoperability between components of the converged infrastructure after the upgrade.

A system method apparatus and computer program product for determining a configuration of a converged infrastructure are disclosed. For example a method in accordance with some example embodiments may include performing a scan of network addresses for components of the converged infrastructure. The method may further include capturing fingerprints of components discovered by the scan. The method may additionally include identifying the components discovered by the scan based at least in part on a comparison between each captured fingerprint and one or more known component fingerprints in a fingerprint library which may include a set of known component fingerprints and associated component identities. The method may further include accessing at least one identified component. The method may also include determining a component configuration of each of at least one accessed component. Accordingly various example embodiments disclosed herein provide for automated determination of the configuration of a converged infrastructure.

In some example embodiments the computing system may include processing circuitry that is configurable to perform actions in accordance with one or more example embodiments disclosed herein. In this regard the processing circuitry may be configured to perform and or control performance of one or more functionalities for determining a configuration of a converged infrastructure such as converged infrastructure and or converged infrastructure in accordance with various example embodiments.

In some example embodiments the processing circuitry may include a processor and in some embodiments such as that illustrated in may further include memory . The processing circuitry may be in communication with e.g. via system bus and or otherwise control the configuration determination module mass storage communication interface and or user interface .

The processor may be embodied in a variety of forms. For example the processor may be embodied as various hardware processing means such as a microprocessor a coprocessor a general purpose processor a controller or various other computing or processing devices including integrated circuits e.g. a logic device such as an ASIC application specific integrated circuit an FPGA field programmable gate array some combination thereof or the like. Although illustrated as a single processor it will be appreciated that the processor may comprise a plurality of processors. The plurality of processors may be in operative communication with each other and may be collectively configured to perform one or more functionalities to support determination of a configuration of a converged infrastructure in accordance with various embodiments. In some embodiments in which the computing system is embodied as a plurality of computing devices a plurality of processors which may collectively form the processor may be distributed across a plurality of computing devices that may be in operative communication with each other directly and or via a network.

In this regard the memory and or mass storage may be configured to store information data applications instructions and or the like for enabling the computing system to carry out various functions in accordance with one or more example embodiments. Applications that may be executed by the processor may also be in the form of modulated electronic signals that may be accessed via a network modem or other network interface of the computing system .

The computing system may further include a communication interface . The communication interface may enable the computing system to communicate e.g. over a network or other communication interface with another computing device or system such as the converged infrastructure user terminal and or other computing device or system. In this regard the communication interface may include one or more interface mechanisms for enabling communication with other devices and or networks. As such the communication interface may include for example an antenna or multiple antennas and supporting hardware and or software for enabling communications with a wireless communication network e.g. a cellular network wireless local area network and or the like and or a communication modem or other hardware software for supporting communication via cable digital subscriber line DSL USB FireWire Ethernet one or more optical transmission technologies and or other wireline networking methods.

In some example embodiments the computing system may include the user interface . It will be appreciated however that in some example embodiments one or more aspects of the user interface may be omitted and in some embodiments the user interface may be omitted entirely. The user interface may be in communication with the processing circuitry to receive an indication of a user input and or to provide an audible visual mechanical or other output to a user. As such the user interface may include for example a keyboard a mouse a joystick a display a touch screen display a microphone a speaker one or more biometric input devices and or other input output mechanisms.

In embodiments including a user interface the user interface may be configured to enable a user to provide input to facilitate determining the configuration of a converged infrastructure such as converged infrastructure and or converged infrastructure . A display and or other output device of the user interface may be configured to provide for visualization and or other output of a report s indicative of a determined configuration of a converged infrastructure. In some example embodiments one or more aspects of the user interface may be implemented on and or otherwise provided by the user terminal .

The computing system may further include configuration determination module . The configuration determination module may be an embodiment of the configuration determination module . The configuration determination module may be embodied as various means such as circuitry hardware a computer program product comprising computer readable program instructions stored on a computer readable medium for example the memory and or mass storage and executed by a processing device for example the processor or some combination thereof. In some embodiments the processor or the processing circuitry may include or otherwise control the configuration determination module . For example in some embodiments the processor may be configured to perform functionality of the configuration determination module e.g. functionality of the configuration determination module through execution of instructions that may be stored on and or otherwise loaded onto the memory and or the mass storage . In some such embodiments the configuration determination module may be loaded on a computing platform of the computing system and or a computing platform of the computing system may be booted to the configuration determination module to configure the processor to perform functionality of the configuration determination module .

Operation may include performing a scan of a plurality of network addresses e.g. IP addresses for components of the converged infrastructure. The plurality of network addresses may include a network address range s a subnet and or other set of network address. In some example embodiments the plurality of network addresses that may be scanned in operation may be specified by a user such as via the user terminal and or the user interface . For example in some embodiments when using the configuration determination module a user may be prompted for an address es at which the converged infrastructure and or components thereof may be located. The user may specify a network address range subnet and or the like which may be received by the configuration determination module and scanned for components of the converged infrastructure.

For example in some embodiments operation may include iteratively pinging or otherwise sweeping the plurality of network addresses such as by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP packet to each respective network address and determining if there is any response from a component on each respective swept network address. In some example embodiments operation may include looking at particular set of ports of a respective network address to determine if there is a component of the converged infrastructure at the address. Based on the scanning of operation the configuration determination module may discover existence of a plurality of components of the converged infrastructure and an associated set of network addresses of the plurality of network addresses at which discovered components of the converged infrastructure are located.

Operation may include capturing a fingerprint of each of a plurality of the components discovered by the scan. A captured fingerprint of a component may comprise one or more characteristics of the component. For example in some embodiments capturing a fingerprint of a discovered component may include determining a port configuration of the discovered component. The port configuration may for example include which port s are active and or which port s are inactive for the discovered component. In some example embodiments a captured fingerprint for a discovered component may further include a fingerprint of active software and or services of the component. For example in some embodiments a port configuration that may be determined for a component may include a port mapping between active ports and respective applications and or services active on the ports.

In some embodiments operation may include querying a port s of a discovered component and receiving a returned response message such as a simple mail transfer protocol SMTP . The header and or content of the returned response message may be examined to determine information that may be used to capture the fingerprint of the discovered component.

Operation may include identifying the components discovered by the scan of operation based at least in part on a comparison between each captured fingerprint and known component fingerprints in a fingerprint library. The fingerprint library may comprise a database of known component fingerprints. In this regard operation may include looking up a fingerprint captured in operation in the database to determine a known component having a matching fingerprint. Thus for example in some embodiments operation may include determining a component having a port configuration corresponding to the port configuration of a discovered component. In this regard the characteristics of a discovered component may be compared to the characteristics of one or more known components in order to identify the discovered component.

In some example embodiments the fingerprint library may be maintained in the memory and or the mass storage . In some example embodiments the fingerprint library may be maintained remotely such that the configuration determination module may be configured to access the remotely stored fingerprint library such as over a network. In embodiments in which at least a portion of the fingerprint library is maintained or cached locally such as in the memory and or the mass storage the locally maintained copy of the fingerprint library may be synchronized and or updated e.g. periodically based on a remotely maintained fingerprint library such that new components updated component fingerprints and or the like may be updated to the locally maintained copy.

A known component fingerprint in the fingerprint library may specify a port configuration for a component. As a further example in some embodiments a known component fingerprint in the fingerprint library may include a profile indicative of active software and or services associated with a component. In this regard a known component fingerprint may define a profile of any information that can be ascertained from fingerprinting a component such that a fingerprint capture for a component may be matched to a known component fingerprint in the fingerprint library.

In some example embodiments if a known component fingerprint matching a captured fingerprint cannot be found in the fingerprint library and or if there are known component fingerprints matching a captured fingerprint the user may be prompted to identify the component. For example the user may be presented with the captured fingerprint and or the network address at which the discovered component is located and the user may be prompted to identify the component. If the component is not a component of the converged infrastructure the user may select to skip further identification of the component in some example embodiments.

Some components that may be identified in operation may be accessed to determine an internal configuration of the components. For such components the method may further include operations and . Operation may include accessing at least one identified component.

In some example embodiments operation may include using an access credential s such as a login name s password s and or other access credential s to access a component. In this regard an access credential may be used to log into and or otherwise gain authorization to access a component. In some such example embodiments the access credential s may be supplied by the user. For example in some embodiments the user may supply the access credential s at the outset of the configuration determination process e.g. prior to performance of operation . Additionally or alternatively in some example embodiments the user may be prompted to provide access credentials for one or more components identified in operation prior to or during performance of operation . Additionally or alternatively in some example embodiments the access credential s may be maintained in an access credential database file or the like such that the access credential s may be available to the configuration determination module without requiring user input.

A more detailed example of operations that may be performed attendant to performance of operation in embodiments in which an access credential provided by a user may be used to access a component is illustrated in . In this regard illustrates a flowchart according to an example method for accessing a discovered component of a converged infrastructure such as converged infrastructure and or converged infrastructure in accordance with some example embodiments. More particularly illustrates operations that may be performed by configuration determination module to facilitate performance of operation in accordance with some example embodiments. One or more elements of the computing system such as the configuration determination module processing circuitry processor memory system bus mass storage communication interface and or the user interface may for example provide means for performing one or more of the operations illustrated in and described with respect to in accordance with some example embodiments.

Operation may include prompting the user for a component access credential. In some example embodiments operation may be performed at the outset of the configuration determination process e.g. prior to performance of operation . As another example in some embodiments operation may be performed subsequent to identifying a component s in operation . For example a user may be prompted with a list of one or more components and asked to supply access credentials for each respective listed component.

Operation may include receiving one or more access credentials supplied by the user. In some example embodiments the received access credential s may include an access credential s specified in association with a particular component s . Additionally or alternatively in some example embodiments the component associated with a received access credential may not be specified or otherwise known.

Operation may include using a received access credential to log into and access a discovered component. If the access credential associated with the component is specified by the user and or is otherwise known to the configuration determination module operation may include selecting the appropriate access credential and accessing the component. Alternatively in some example embodiments in which a user provides a set of one or more access credentials without specifying the component s which the access credential s may be used to access operation may include attempting to access the discovered component with the available access credential s until the appropriate access credential is identified and the component is successfully accessed.

Returning to operation may include determining component configurations of the accessed components. For example for a hardware component operation may include determining a hardware configuration e.g. subcomponents of the component and or determining a software configuration installed on the component.

A release certification standard may define a set of configuration standards and or guidelines for the configuration of hardware and or software components for a given release of a converged infrastructure and or a component s thereof. A release certification standard may be defined in any of a variety of forms and in some example embodiments may be defined as a release certification matrix RCM . For example in some embodiments the configuration of a converged infrastructure such as converged infrastructure and or converged infrastructure may be determined so that it may be ascertained whether the configuration of the converged infrastructure supports upgrading a component of the converged infrastructure such as by adding new hardware and or upgrading adding software to a component converged infrastructure. In this regard hardware and or software may be certified to be compatible with a converged infrastructure satisfying a certain release certification standard. Accordingly compliance of a converged infrastructure with a release certification standard may be verified before upgrading the converged infrastructure.

Operation may include determining the configuration of the converged infrastructure. Operation may be performed in accordance with any of the various embodiments disclosed herein. By way of non limiting example in some embodiments operation maybe performed in accordance with the method of .

Operation may include comparing the determined configuration to a release certification standard. By way of non limiting example the release certification standard may be an RCM. However it will be appreciated that other forms of release certification standards may be used within the scope of the disclosure. In some embodiments the release certification standard may be a release certification standard specified by the user. In some example embodiments operation may include comparison of the determined configuration to a plurality of release certification standards to determine with which if any release certification standard the determined configuration complies and or with which the determined configuration is closest to compliance.

Having now described systems apparatuses and methods for determining the configuration of a converged infrastructure such as converged infrastructure and or converged infrastructure in accordance with several example embodiments an example use case and configuration determination process to determine compliance with an RCM in accordance with some example embodiments in which the configuration determination module is embodied as and or otherwise contained on a bootable computer readable storage medium will now be described. While the example is described with respect to determining compliance with an RCM it will be appreciated that the operations and techniques described may be applied mutatis mutandis to determining compliance with any form of a release certification standard within the scope of the disclosure. A user may boot a computing platform implemented on and or communicatively coupled with the converged infrastructure to the configuration determination module . For example the user may insert a flash drive e.g. a USB flash drive into a port of a server that may be implemented on the converged infrastructure and reboot the server to the configuration determination module . In accordance with some example embodiments the computing device that may be booted to the configuration determination module may be booted to an OS such as a Linux OS version which may include an application providing functionality of the configuration determination module . The application may include components of VCE Vision such as JBoss a System Library a Compliance Library and a database such as a PostgreSQL database.

After booting to the configuration determination module the configuration determination module may find an address such as through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP techniques. The configuration determination module may then be reachable e.g. via a web browser on the DHCP address. In some embodiments the bootable OS may not persist any data. Application components such as a PostgreSQL database and any file system activities may be configured onto a RAM or other non persistent media.

In some embodiments if the user is accessing the application for the first time after booting to the configuration determination module the user may be prompted for a preconfigured user ID and password combination and or may prompt the user to configure a user ID and password combination. In some example embodiments however the usage of a user ID and password combination for accessing and using the configuration determination module may be omitted.

The user may then supply one or more network addresses e.g. IP addresses such as a subnet s network address range and or the like to be scanned for components of the converged infrastructure . The configuration determination module may scan the network addresses specified by the user. In some example embodiments the configuration determination module may check each network address for a known set of possible ports. When a valid network address with a component e.g. a host listening is found a fingerprint of the component may be captured by the configuration determination module . The configuration determination module may compare the captured fingerprint to a set of known component fingerprints in a fingerprint library. The configuration determination module may use the result of the fingerprint comparison to map each respective network address on which a component of the converged infrastructure is found to the type of component found on the network address.

In some example embodiments the configuration determination module may present one or more found components such as one or more management servers to the user and prompt the user to supply the username s and password s and or other access credential s for the components. After the access credentials have been supplied by the user the configuration determination module may write out a configuration report file such as an XML file including the identified components and perform configuration determination process to determine the configurations of the components identified in the scan. The configuration determination process may include the configuration determination module sending out a message s such as via Advanced Message Queuing Protocol AMQP for components in the configuration report file that have been fully discovered. The configuration determination module may listen for response events e.g. AMQP events to obtain configuration information for the discovered components. For example in some embodiments a software process may use access credentials to access discovered components and determine configuration details for the discovered components. The software process may include an interface such as a representational state transfer REST application programming interface API configured to enable the configuration determination module to query e.g. via AMQP messaging the software process for the configuration details of discovered components.

After all of the identified components have been fully scanned attendant to the configuration determination process the configuration determination module may present the user with an option to select the type of converged infrastructure if not already known and may ask the user to select the RCM version to which the user wishes to compare the converged infrastructure . The configuration determination module may in turn perform a compliance scan in which the determined configuration of the converged infrastructure may be compared to the selected RCM version.

After the compliance scan has been completed the configuration determination module may output an RCM compliance report for the converged infrastructure . In some example embodiments the RCM compliance report may be formatted as a file such as a PDF file XML file JSON file CSV file and or other file format that may be downloaded by the user. Additionally or alternatively in some example embodiments the configuration determination module may present an RCM compliance report to the user on a display such as a display of the user terminal and or a display of the user interface . For example in some embodiments a compliance score comparing the converged infrastructure to the selected RCM version may be displayed.

The configuration determination module may additionally provide the user with the ability to retrieve a model e.g. a text based model for the configuration of the entire converged infrastructure . In some embodiments the model may be retrieved after the configuration determination process has been completed and the configuration determination module has received the message indicating that all of the identified components have been fully scanned. Any of a variety of formats may be used for the model. For example in some embodiments the format of the model may be XML based or JSON based. In some embodiments the System Library may include configuration information for known components that may be used to generate the model based on the determined configuration of the converged infrastructure . Post processing may be performed to store the output in a single structure.

In instances in which a server or other computing platform of the converged infrastructure has been booted to the configuration determination module the computing platform may be reset after completion of the configuration determination process by booting back to a standard default configuration. For example if a flash memory drive has been used to boot the computing platform the flash memory drive may be removed and the computing platform may be powered off and powered back on. The computing platform may then boot into the default OS configuration and resume its prior function.
