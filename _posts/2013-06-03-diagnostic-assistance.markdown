This application is related to pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 908 600 entitled EVENT DRIVEN SNAPSHOTS filed on Jun. 3 2013 and pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 908 651 entitled DRIVING ANALYTICS filed on Jun. 3 2013. The entireties of the above noted application s are incorporated by reference herein.

Generally a vehicle includes a variety of systems where a system can include one or more units or one or more sensors. For example a vehicle can have an engine system a fuel system a transmission system an electrical system an antilock braking system ABS a vehicle stability assist VSA system a telematics system etc. Components of a vehicle such as a system unit sensor etc. can be connected via one or more connections or one or more networks. When a problem with a vehicle occurs information related to one or more of the components can be helpful to determine a solution to the problem or a root cause of the problem for example. However as technology advances and systems or vehicles become more complex troubleshooting can be difficult or time consuming.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to be an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

One or more embodiments of techniques or systems for customization of snapshots diagnostic assistance and driving analytics for one or more vehicles are provided herein. Generally a vehicle can include one or more systems which can include one or more units or one or more sensors. Additionally components of a vehicle such as a system unit or sensor can be connected by one or more connections or one or more controller area networks CANs . Information or data pertaining to or associated with components systems units sensors CANs etc. can be collected by taking a snapshot of one or more corresponding parameters. These snapshots can enhance troubleshooting diagnostic assistance root cause analysis or a driving experience of a driver of a vehicle.

According to one or more embodiments a snapshot can customized for a driver of a vehicle in a per occurrence manner. For example when a driver of a vehicle notifies a third party such as a dealer that they are experiencing a problem the third party can arrange for a snapshot to be taken the next time the problem or a similar problem occurs. In other words the third party can configure the vehicle to take a snapshot based on user input. As an example a dealer can tell a driver to press and hold the power button on the stereo of the vehicle for three seconds when the vehicle bucks. Upon receiving the user input such as the pushing and holding of the power button the vehicle could record snapshot data related to one or more potential trouble areas or components. Further the snapshot data can be sent to a server along with other snapshots from other vehicles for analysis. In this way regional issues can be quickly identified. For example if a gas station is dispensing gasoline tainted with impurities a compilation of snapshot data from vehicles in the area could be used to determine such a problem because fuel tanks on problem vehicles are detected to be full.

According to one or more embodiments troubleshooting tips or diagnostic assistance can be provided for efficient troubleshooting. Because a vehicle generally has a fixed known or pre programmed configuration e.g. based on a model make year serial number etc. of the vehicle a snapshot can be directed towards a set of data that enables one or more areas or components of the vehicle to be classified as suspect non suspect or unknown. As an example a circuit of an electrical system of the vehicle is generally known and consistent across a model of a particular vehicle. When a problem occurs such as a diagnostic trouble code DTC the vehicle can be configured to indicate one or more potential problem areas. A snapshot can be taken based on the DTC and the configuration of the circuit. This snapshot can be used to analyze one or more of the potential problem areas and classify the potential problem areas as suspect or non suspect. Non suspect areas can be removed from troubleshooting or ranked lower than suspect areas. Accordingly a technician could inspect one or more of the suspect areas before inspecting one or more of the non suspect areas thereby improving or enhancing diagnostic assistance by mitigating troubleshooting time.

According to one or more embodiments a snapshot can be setup to record parameters related to wear and tear on components of the vehicle. The snapshot can be used to generate a report for a driver with a summary of driving habits of the driver. Additionally suggestions can be made to a driver of the vehicle to reduce or mitigate actions that negatively impact wear and tear. For example if a driver tends to take hard turns a report could be generated to suggest that the driver take turns at a lower speed. In one or more embodiments suggestions can be made to the driver in real time such as during or shortly after the turn. In other embodiments suggestions can be made to a driver before the driver approaches an anticipated fast turn. For example a voice prompt could suggest the driver slow down to 10 miles per hour mph in advance.

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects are employed. Other aspects advantages or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

Embodiments or examples illustrated in the drawings are disclosed below using specific language. It will nevertheless be understood that the embodiments or examples are not intended to be limiting. Any alterations and modifications in the disclosed embodiments and any further applications of the principles disclosed in this document are contemplated as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.

For one or more of the figures herein one or more boundaries such as boundary of for example are drawn with different heights widths perimeters aspect ratios shapes etc. relative to one another merely for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily drawn to scale. For example because dashed or dotted lines are used to represent different boundaries if the dashed and dotted lines were drawn on top of one another they would not be distinguishable in the figures and thus are drawn with different dimensions or slightly apart from one another in one or more of the figures so that they are distinguishable from one another. As another example where a boundary is associated with an irregular shape the boundary such as a box drawn with a dashed line dotted lined etc. does not necessarily encompass an entire component in one or more instances. Conversely a drawn box does not necessarily encompass merely an associated component in one or more instances but encompasses at least a portion of one or more other components as well.

As used herein a component can include one or more systems one or more units one or more controller area networks CANs one or more sensors one or more connections one or more additional components or other components.

As an example snapshot data for a vehicle can be customized when a driver or an occupant of the vehicle notices a symptom such as a hard buck. The driver can notify a third party of the symptom by initiating a request. The request can be initiated via the input component . In one or more embodiments the input component can include buttons on a steering wheel dashboard radio etc. of the vehicle. For example a driver or an occupant of a vehicle can issue a request via a voice command. As another example the driver or the occupant can press a button on a dash of the vehicle such as a power button for a radio. In other words the input component can be configured to receive a request from a driver or an occupant of a vehicle.

A request can include or be based on one or more symptoms experienced by the driver or the occupant. The request can be passed along to a telematics component and sent to a third party. For example a driver could initiate a request via a voice command by speaking I m having problems with my vehicle . An audio component or an input component could route the request to a telematics component over one or more CANs which can initiate or transmit a phone call an email a text an alert etc. to a third party. The audio component can include a microphone or one or more speakers. In other embodiments the request can be initiated through the input component by the push of a button or a sequence of buttons. The interface component can include a display and be configured to confirm the request for the driver or that the request has been sent to the third party.

In one or more embodiments such as when a phone call is initiated with a third party based on a request from a driver of a vehicle the driver or occupant of the vehicle can verbally communicate one or more symptoms they are experiencing to the third party. For example the driver can be connected with an operator and given an opportunity to discuss problems that he or she can be experiencing. A driver can provide details pertaining to one or more symptoms such as gears grinding when shifting noises uneven acceleration a buck etc. In response a snapshot package can be generated and sent to the vehicle. According to one or more aspects a consent component can prompt the driver for consent to have the vehicle receive the snapshot package or to participate in a data collection program utilizing snapshots for example. In one or more embodiments the interface component can be configured to display the prompt for consent. In other embodiments the audio component can be configured to provide an audio prompt for consent to participate by receiving or downloading a snapshot package or taking snapshots. The driver can opt in or opt out using the input component such as by pushing a button or the audio component such as by giving verbal authorization. The interface component or the audio component can be configured to provide visual or audio confirmation of a selection for example.

Generally a vehicle can have one or more components systems units sensors or controller area networks CANs etc. A CAN may be configured to share information or enable connectivity between components of a vehicle. These components often have one or more corresponding parameters. For example an engine system can be associated with one or more engine conditions such as coolant temperature engine speed throttle position engine load air flow rate fuel pressure etc. However because a symptom or a problem can be unique a snapshot of a standard set of parameters may not be useful or detailed enough for troubleshooting.

A snapshot package enables customization of one or more of these parameters. For example an interval at which a parameter is measured can be increased or decreased thereby enhancing a level of granularity associated with a parameter. As another example the snapshot package can enable one or more parameters to be measured or recorded at a customized time. The snapshot package can enable a vehicle to record one or more of the parameters when an event or a trigger occurs. Further the snapshot package can include a set of customized parameters to measure or record thereby mitigating storage space for parameters that may not be of interest. In this way a snapshot can be customized by setting a snapshot package up accordingly.

A telematics component or a storage component can be configured to receive or store a snapshot package. For example the snapshot package can be transmitted to the vehicle via a telematics channel. Additionally the interface component or the audio component can be configured to confirm when a snapshot package is received or stored to a vehicle. The audio component can play a tone when the snapshot package is downloaded via the telematics component . The interface component can flash a light or display text confirming receipt of the snapshot package. If a vehicle is not equipped with telematics a driver can take the vehicle to a dealer to receive the snapshot package. The dealer can connect an external device to the vehicle a CAN of the vehicle or the interface component to transmit the snapshot package to the vehicle. In this way the vehicle can be configured to receive or store the snapshot package.

A snapshot package can include a trigger a snapshot window a set of one or more parameters and one or more corresponding components e.g. associated with one or more of the parameters or from which the parameters can be recorded . The trigger can be a condition that when met triggers a recording of one or more of the parameters from one or more of the corresponding components. The snapshot window can be a duration or a window such as before the trigger during the trigger or after the trigger during which one or more of the parameters are to be recorded. In one or more embodiments data from one or more parameters of the vehicle can be measured in a continuous discrete manner. In this example when an occurrence of a trigger is received data associated with these measurements can be recorded. In this way data associated with one or more of the parameters can be recorded for an event when an event of interest occurs before a trigger such as for example when a driver experiences a problem or a symptom with a vehicle.

Additionally a snapshot package can include different snapshot windows for one or more of the parameters. A snapshot package can include parameters A B and C where A and B have a same snapshot window while parameter C has a different snapshot window. As an example a snapshot package can include engine speed and engine temperature. In some scenarios it can be desirable to record or examine a greater range or window of engine temperature data than engine speed data. Here the snapshot package can be customized such that the engine temperature parameter is recorded for a longer period of time than the engine speed parameter. Additionally the snapshot package can include a recording interval or recording frequency for one or more of the parameters. For example a recording interval or recording frequency can specify how often a measurement is taken from a corresponding component.

In one or more embodiments a snapshot package can be pre programmed into a vehicle. For example commonly recorded parameters can be packaged together in a pre programmed snapshot package that can be available for use without a request. Pre programmed snapshot packages may be included based on historical data from drivers or based on a model of a vehicle for example.

Upon alerting a third party about the symptom a snapshot package can be generated by a third party such by an operator or a server and sent to the vehicle. The snapshot package can be received by the vehicle. Since components of the vehicle are continuously taking measurements the driver can manually trigger a snapshot after the symptom occurs and capture a recording of parameters associated with a problem or a symptom during a time period prior to the manual trigger. In one or more embodiments customer service can send or transmit a snapshot package to a vehicle and tell a driver to manually trigger a snapshot the next time a symptom occurs. For example customer service can tell the driver to hold down the power button to the stereo for three seconds when the vehicle lurches. In response to the manual trigger of pressing and holding the button a snapshot can be recorded from a set of rolling or continuously measured parameters such that the snapshot includes data prior to the manual trigger.

In one or more embodiments one or more additional components or one or more corresponding components can include chassis components engine components fuel components transmission components electrical components power components charging components audio components antilock braking system ABS components all wheel drive AWD components vehicle stability assist VSA components one or more sensors temperature components etc. These additional components can include different combinations of systems units sensors sub components etc. and be associated with one or more parameters. In one or more embodiments one or more of these parameters can be measured on a rolling basis or stored to the storage component . A snapshot is generally a recording or a measurement of one or more of the parameters designated by the snapshot package taken during a duration corresponding to the snapshot window of the snapshot package. The snapshot can be initiated by an event or trigger provided by the snapshot package. When the snapshot is triggered parameters not designated by the snapshot package can be discarded or archived for example. In other words a subset of the parameters measured on a rolling basis can be collected or stored based on the snapshot package.

When a snapshot package is received a trigger component can poll one or more CANs for an occurrence of a trigger. For example if a trigger of a received snapshot package is a voice command the audio component can receive the voice command and pass the voice command to a CAN where the voice command can be identified as an occurrence of a trigger. As another example if a driver is experiencing bucking from the vehicle a snapshot package can have a trigger setup to record a snapshot when a longitudinal G sensor has a delta x greater than or exceeding a threshold. When such a buck occurs a CAN connected to a system including the longitudinal G sensor can be notified of the buck thereby triggering a snapshot of one or more parameters of interest. In this way the trigger component can be configured to monitor the vehicle or one or more CANs of the vehicle for one or more triggers.

A trigger can be triggered manually or automatically. For example if a driver of a vehicle indicates that his or her vehicle doesn t start quickly a snapshot package can include a trigger to automatically record one or more parameters if the vehicle isn t started within two seconds of ignition where one or more of the parameters relate to ignition of the vehicle. Here the trigger can be based on one or more conditions associated with one or more of the corresponding components. A trigger can be based on a statistic related to a component of a vehicle. For example if 98 of vehicles start within two seconds of ignition a snapshot package or a trigger of a snapshot package can be set to record data when a vehicle takes longer than two seconds to start. As another example if a driver is experiencing an intermittent problem the snapshot package can be configured to record or store parameters based on a manual trigger such as a voice command via the audio component or a push of a button via the input component . The manual trigger can include pushing a sequence of buttons or pressing a holding one or more buttons of the input component for example. In other words the trigger can be based on one or more user inputs.

When an occurrence of a trigger is detected by the trigger component the snapshot component can record a snapshot according to the snapshot package. For example a snapshot window can dictate that data or parameters are to be recorded fifteen seconds before a trigger through five seconds after the trigger. This enables the snapshot to capture a more complete view of a situation or symptoms associated with a problem for example. In other words when a trigger is sent over a CAN one or more systems units components sensors etc. within the vehicle can be configured to issue a record data command in response to the trigger. This record data command can instruct the storage component to pluck parameter information or data from the CAN and populate a snapshot accordingly within a snapshot window. The snapshot component can be configured to record one or more parameters designated by the snapshot package within a snapshot window or time frame in response to an occurrence of a trigger. In other words the snapshot component can be configured to take a snapshot based on a snapshot package and an occurrence of a trigger by recording a set of one or more parameters from one or more corresponding components as indicated by the snapshot package. The snapshot package or snapshot component can be configured to capture one or more of the parameters from one or more CANs . The snapshot can be taken from a set of parameters that are measured on a rolling basis thereby enabling a snapshot to record or capture data prior to an occurrence of a trigger. In one or more embodiments the snapshot component enables a snapshot of one or more parameters to be taken without an external diagnostic tool because the system can transmit the snapshot to a server or a third party via the telematics component .

Additionally notification can be provided that a snapshot has been recorded. For example the audio component can be configured to play a tone when a snapshot is recorded or the interface component can flash a light a light emitting diode LED or display a confirmation text etc. In one or more embodiments the telematics component can be configured to send one or more parties an alert that the snapshot has been recorded or is available. For example the driver can be sent a text message email or other alert that the snapshot is recorded. Additionally the dealership or a third party can also be alerted that the snapshot has been recorded.

The snapshot component can store the snapshot in the storage component by communicating the snapshot from the snapshot component over one or more of the CANs to the storage component . In one or more embodiments the telematics component can be configured to transmit the snapshot to a third party such as a server for example. In other words the snapshot can be transmitted based on a telematics channel. Additionally the telematics component can be configured to notify a third party when the snapshot is available such as after a driver initiates a manual trigger. If a vehicle is not equipped with a telematics component a driver can bring a vehicle into a dealer where an external device can be connected to the vehicle to retrieve the snapshot. An analysis of the snapshot can be performed and one or more suggestions or solutions can be proposed based on the snapshot. In one or more embodiments the telematics component can be configured to receive one or more of the suggestions or one or more of the solutions from the third party or a server. Accordingly when the driver takes the vehicle into a dealer the dealer can be presented with troubleshooting suggestions or solutions for a problem. For example data from the snapshot can indicate that one or more components systems units or areas of the vehicle are suspect and point a technician towards those areas.

For example when a driver of a vehicle such as Vehicle A experiences a problem or a symptom a driver or an occupant of the vehicle can initiate send or transmit a request for assistance to the server component . The request can be initiated by a driver or an occupant of the vehicle by holding a button down for example. One or more vehicles such as Vehicles A and C can be communicatively coupled with the server component via a telematics channel or a telematics component on the vehicle not shown . The server component can be configured to receive the request from one or more vehicles. The request can include or be based on one or more of the symptoms associated with the vehicle. In one or more embodiments the server component is configured to receive one or more symptoms associated with a vehicle. As an example the driver of a vehicle could be prompted with a list of symptoms such as noises smells vibrations movements bucks etc. In this example the driver can select one or more appropriate symptoms and transmit the symptoms to the server component . In other embodiments the driver of a vehicle can provide an operator with one or more of the symptoms and the operator can input or provide one or more of the symptoms to the server component .

When one or more of the symptoms for a vehicle are received the server component can pass the symptoms to the package component . The package component can be configured to generate a snapshot package for a vehicle based on one or more symptoms associated with the vehicle in response to the request. Additionally the package component can be configured to generate a snapshot package based on a configuration of the vehicle. Generally a snapshot package includes a trigger a snapshot window or a duration of the snapshot a set of one or more parameters to be recorded from one or more corresponding components of a vehicle and other parameters related to recording snapshot data such as a recording interval or recording frequency. The package component can be configured to generate a snapshot by determining one or more triggers one or more snapshot windows and one or more parameters to record from one or more corresponding components of a vehicle. In other words the package component can select which units systems components sensors etc. of a vehicle will send store or record what type of information. Accordingly a snapshot can be setup to include a variety of parameters pertinent to a particular symptom. Further a snapshot can be setup to trigger according to a condition relating to one or more parameters. For example a snapshot package can be setup to trigger a snapshot when a vertical G sensor exceeds a threshold value. In this way use of storage can be mitigated because parameters can be recorded in a custom manner.

The package component can configure a snapshot package to record one or more parameters of one or more corresponding components thought to be related to a root cause of a problem which can be causing one or more of the symptoms. For example a snapshot package can be configured to capture data or parameters from one or more systems units or CANs based on one or more symptoms. Additionally the package component can set the snapshot window or recording interval accordingly such that an appropriate amount of data can be captured before during or after a symptom occurs and the snapshot is triggered. In one or more embodiments the snapshot package can be configured off board of a vehicle.

In one or more embodiments the package component can generate a snapshot package with one or more triggers. For example a snapshot package can be configured to record a snapshot based on a manual trigger or an automatic trigger. A snapshot can be manually triggered by a driver or an occupant of a vehicle by providing one or more user inputs such as a voice command pushing or holding a combination of one or more buttons etc. This can be done by the driver when a symptom occurs. Additionally a snapshot can be automatically triggered by a sensor unit component system etc. of a vehicle. For example a snapshot can be recorded when a unit detects that the engine coolant temperature is greater than a threshold or a triggering condition.

The package component can pass the snapshot package to the server component . In one or more embodiments the server component can be configured to transmit or send a snapshot package to a vehicle such as in response to a request for assistance from the vehicle for example. In one or more embodiments the server component can be configured to transmit the snapshot package via a telematics channel to a telematics component of the vehicle. If a vehicle is not equipped with telematics an external device not shown can be used to transmit a snapshot to a vehicle. For example a driver can bring his or her vehicle into a dealership describe one or more symptoms exhibited by the vehicle and have a snapshot downloaded to the vehicle via an external device where the snapshot can be a set of one or more parameters customized to one or more of the symptoms described by the driver.

When a vehicle records a snapshot the vehicle can be configured to transmit the snapshot to the server component . For example the server component can receive the snapshot and send the snapshot to the analysis component for analysis. The analysis component can be configured to provide one or more troubleshooting tips one or more suggestions one or more solutions based on the snapshot and symptoms of the vehicle. In one or more embodiments the analysis component can be configured to receive a snapshot from the server component where the snapshot include a set of one or more parameters associated with one or more corresponding components of a vehicle.

Further the analysis component can be configured to determine one or more trends from one or more snapshots gathered from one or more vehicles. For example if a vehicle such as Vehicle A reports symptoms that the engine is shuddering a snapshot package can be generated to investigate parameters related to spark plugs a distributor cap an oxygen sensor fuel tank level location of the vehicle etc. on the vehicle. Similarly Vehicles B and C can also report engine shuddering and similar snapshot packages can be generated. If snapshot data gathered from Vehicles A B and C indicates that engine misfires are occurring while the fuel tank levels on respective vehicles are relatively full it can be determined that gasoline tainted with impurities is being distributed by a local gas station for example. In this way data from one or more additional snapshots associated with one or more additional vehicles can be analyzed to determine a trend. The trend can be within vehicle or the trend can be across multiple vehicles.

Additionally the analysis component can determine trends across geographic regions times of day days of the year models of cars temperatures vendors specifications regional issues etc. For example if multiple vehicles are reporting failures of a unit within a model of a car a trend can be determined indicating a specification issue or a quality issue associated with that unit or from a vendor of the unit.

A vehicle can include one or more components systems units sensors CANs etc. When a component etc. detects a failure or a malfunction a diagnostic trouble code DTC may be sent over a CAN. For example one or more of the corresponding components can report a DTC over one or more of the CANs . When the DTC is received by the trigger component or one of the CANs the snapshot component can capture or record a snapshot according to a snapshot package based on the DTC and a configuration of the vehicle. In this scenario the DTC acts as a trigger for recording the snapshot. Stated another way a snapshot can be triggered by a DTC or a trigger can include a DTC. The snapshot package can be configured to capture or record one or more parameters from one or more additional components that did not send the DTC. The snapshot package can also capture one or more parameters from one or more corresponding components such as a component that sent the DTC for example. In this way substantially comprehensive information or data relating to a failure a malfunction or a DTC can be captured by a snapshot.

When a snapshot is captured or recorded the snapshot can be received by or stored in the storage component . In one or more embodiments the snapshot can be accessed via connecting an external device to the interface component which can retrieve the snapshot from the storage component over one or more of the CANs . That is the interface component can be configured to transmit the snapshot to a third party or an external device. For example when a driver brings a vehicle into a dealership a technician can connect and external device to the vehicle via the interface component and access a snapshot stored on the storage component over one or more of the CANs . In other embodiments the snapshot can be transmitted remotely such as via a telematics component not shown . Additionally the storage component can be configured to store or be pre loaded with one or more snapshot packages for different DTCs.

Because a DTC can be indicative of trouble failures malfunctions in a potential trouble area or traced back to a corresponding component that sent the DTC a DTC can be used as a factor trigger or a starting point when troubleshooting. Often the corresponding component that sent the DTC can be connected linked shared overlapped have a commonality etc. with one or more additional components such as one or more systems one or more units one or more sensors etc. In other words a configuration of a vehicle can be indicative of connections interactions commonality etc. between components systems units sensors CANs etc. Generally components systems units sensors connections or the like etc. can be associated with one or more areas. Readings data parameters etc. from these additional components can be used to identify one or more suspect areas in conjunction with parameters from one or more of the corresponding components . Therefore a corresponding component may or may not be a component that sends or reports a DTC. In one or more embodiments parameters can be selected for a snapshot package based on the configuration of the vehicle.

Stated another way a system can include a number of components interconnected via one or more connections. When a DTC is received from a component initiating the DTC e.g. a corresponding component data or parameters can be recorded from one or more other components e.g. additional components or other corresponding components to facilitate root cause analysis or troubleshooting based on relationships one or more of the other components have with the component that initiated the DTC. Additionally different snapshot packages can be used for different DTCs. That is a snapshot package can be selected based on a type of DTC detected. For example a voltage related DTC can trigger use of a snapshot for capturing voltage parameters etc. Additionally other parameters can be captured due to connections that can be obtained based on a configuration of the vehicle. These parameters can be pre programmed in one or more snapshot packages stored or pre loaded on the storage component based on a DTC and a configuration of a vehicle. In one or more embodiments the storage component or the interface component can be configured to receive a configuration of a vehicle. When a DTC is detected by the trigger component the snapshot component can capture the snapshot of one or more parameters over one or more CANs based on the DTC and a corresponding snapshot package where the snapshot package is determined based on a configuration of the vehicle or a relationship between a component initiating the DTC and one or more additional components. Custom diagnostic assistance can be generated based on the snapshot the configuration of the vehicle or the DTC.

When a component associated with system such as Unit A reports a voltage related DTC a snapshot of one or more parameters can be captured. As an example Unit A can report that a reading of 9 volts rather than an expected 12 volts. Because the DTC is voltage related a corresponding snapshot package of electrical related parameters can be retrieved. Unit A and Unit B should both report 12 volts because they are both connected to a 12V power supply through the fuse box . As well this is because the system voltage here is 12 volts. Because Unit A is reporting 9 volts electrical related snapshot data can be captured for one or more components systems units sensors etc. of system . In this example snapshot data measurements or parameters can be captured from Unit A Unit B and Sensor X to facilitate troubleshooting. In one or more embodiments a pre loaded snapshot package can be configured to capture a voltage of Unit B when a DTC is detected such as by a trigger component for example. In a scenario where Unit B has a voltage reading of 9 volts or a parameter of Unit B indicates that Unit B is receiving 9 volts area A can be identified as a suspect area because a faulty fuse box or a faulty power source could result in Unit B sharing a bad voltage reading or parameter as Unit A . Conversely in a scenario where Unit B has a reading of 12 volts or a parameter of Unit B indicates that Unit B is receiving 12 volts area A can be identified as non suspect for similar reasons.

Additionally a snapshot package can be configured to capture a sensor status parameter from Unit B relating to a sensor value of Sensor X . In a scenario where the sensor status parameter of Unit B is marginal or faulty area A corresponding to the first ground can be identified as a suspect area because Sensor X reports the sensor status to Unit B and because Unit A and Sensor X are configured to share the first ground via connections and . It can also be possible although highly unlikely that Unit A and Sensor X are both faulty or that connections and are faulty. Since these possibilities are less likely to be suspect than area A they can be ranked lower or indicated as such. In this way the connections and of the vehicle configuration can be used to determine parameters to record for a snapshot package.

In a scenario where the sensor status parameter of Unit B is normal or within a desired range area A corresponding to the first ground can be identified as a non suspect area because Sensor X reports to Unit B and because Unit A and Sensor X are configured to share the first ground . To this end if the first ground is faulty it would be unlikely that Sensor X would report a normal value to Unit B . Accordingly in one or more embodiments area A could be removed from consideration for diagnostic assistance. In other embodiments area A can be ranked as a low probability suspect area. Because Unit B indicates a normal voltage value and area A is connected to Unit A and Unit B area A can be marked as a non suspect area and removed from troubleshooting consideration. In this scenario a suspect area can be determined include the connection from the fuse box to Unit A the connection from Unit A to the first ground and Unit A .

In one or more embodiments one or more snapshot packages can be pre loaded on a vehicle such as on a storage component of the vehicle where the snapshot packages can be based on a configuration of a vehicle and configured to capture a snapshot based on a type of DTC. For example a voltage related DTC can trigger capturing of a snapshot using a first snapshot package while another type of DTC can trigger a snapshot to be captured using a second snapshot package and so forth because different DTCs are based on different fault criteria. In one or more embodiments a snapshot package can include a trigger one or more parameters to be recorded from one or more corresponding components and a snapshot window. The trigger can be a DTC or a condition related to a parameter. These snapshot packages can be determined or pre programmed based on a configuration layout or construction of a vehicle. As an example a vehicle configuration can be indicative of one or more shared connections an overlap between one or more components an association between one or more components a relationship between one or more components or any combination thereof. In other words parameters or data to be recorded for a snapshot package can be from units components etc. associated with a unit or component that reports a failure or a malfunction. A snapshot package can be configured to trigger a capture of a snapshot based on a DTC a type of DTC one or more criteria associated with a DTC a potential or suspected problem etc.

At a trigger can be received such as a DTC for example. The trigger or DTC can be received by a trigger component or a CAN. A snapshot can be taken at . For example the snapshot can be taken in response to the trigger and be based on a configuration of the vehicle. Taking the snapshot can include recording a set of one or more parameter from one or more corresponding components of the vehicle and be determined based on the snapshot package. The snapshot package can be configured to capture a snapshot including one or more parameters from one or more associated systems units components sensors etc. Components can be determined to be associated with other components based on the configuration of the vehicle. For example a first component can be associated with a second component if they share a ground. In other words one or more parameters of a snapshot can be selected based on the configuration of the vehicle during snapshot package generation. In this way snapshot data or parameters can be recorded or captured from multiple systems units components etc. that are not necessarily faulty failing reporting a DTC. At the snapshot can be transmitted to a third party.

The snapshot associated with the voltage related DTC can be stored on a storage component of Vehicle A and accessed via one or more CANs. In one or more embodiments a diagnostic component can be configured to receive the snapshot from the Vehicle A such as via an interface component or telematics component for example. Additionally the diagnostic component can receive a configuration of the Vehicle A. The configuration of the Vehicle A can be included in the snapshot sent by the Vehicle A or be received from a diagnostic assistance library . This information can be used to facilitate root cause analysis diagnostic assistance or troubleshooting for Vehicle A in relation to a DTC which triggered the snapshot received by diagnostic component .

An analysis component can be configured to generate custom diagnostic assistance based on the snapshot and a configuration of the Vehicle A. What this means is the custom diagnostic assistance can be specific to an event failure DTC such as a DTC which triggered the snapshot for example. The analysis component can receive a snapshot from the diagnostic component the Vehicle A or an interface component of Vehicle A. In this example with reference to the snapshot can include a system voltage determined to be 12 volts a Unit B reading of 12 volts a Unit A reading of 9 volts and a Sensor X reading that reports a normal ground value to Unit B . The snapshot in this scenario was triggered by a voltage related DTC for system of .

The analysis component can be configured to identify one or more areas associated with system by analyzing a configuration of the system e.g. which can be received from the diagnostic assistance library the diagnostic component the Vehicle A or stored on a storage component of the Vehicle A etc. . Here the system includes components such as a power source a fuse box Unit A Unit B Sensor X a first ground a second ground and one or more connections there between etc. An area can be a grouping of one or more of the components. In other words an area can be associated with one or more corresponding components one or more additional components one or more systems one or more units one or more sensors one or more connections or one or more controller area networks CANs of the vehicle. Stated another way troubleshooting for a DTC can include analyzing snapshot data triggered by a DTC and dividing a configuration of a vehicle into one or more partitions or segments accordingly.

The analysis component can be configured receive a set of one or more diagnostic assistance suggestions from a diagnostic assistance library . For example one or more of the diagnostic assistance suggestions can be made based on a DTC which triggered the snapshot received by the diagnostic component . In other words when a DTC occurs on a vehicle a snapshot can be taken from the vehicle in response to the DTC where parameters of the snapshot can be determined based on a configuration of the vehicle. When this snapshot is received by the diagnostic component the analysis component can pull diagnostic assistance suggestions from the diagnostic assistance library based on the snapshot which can be indicative of the DTC or the type of DTC associated with Vehicle A. These diagnostic assistance suggestions can be related to one or more areas to be considered for troubleshooting the DTC. For example an area can include one or more components one or more systems one or more units one or more sensors one or more connections or one or more CANs etc. that did not necessarily initiate send or transmit a DTC. This means that these areas may be linked to a component which initiated a DTC via one or more connections relationships links etc. As an example the diagnostic assistance suggestions can include instructions to inspect the power supply the fuse box Unit A Unit B the first ground the second ground Sensor X and the respective connections for system . However the analysis component can customize the diagnostic assistance instructions to mitigate a number of components to inspect. Further the analysis component can rank one or more of the diagnostic assistance instructions based on a likelihood of failure.

The analysis component can classify one or more of the areas components systems units sensors connections etc. as suspect non suspect normal marginal unknown etc. based on snapshot data and the configuration of the vehicle such as Vehicle A. For example area A can be classified as non suspect because Unit B has a 12 volt reading and the fuse box is shared between Unit A and Unit B . Components above the fuse box can be included in area A due to the normal voltage reading from Unit B . Similarly area A can be classified as non suspect due to the normal sensor status associated with Sensor X e.g. which is provided by connection to Unit B .

In one or more embodiments connection connection and Unit A can be grouped into an area and classified as a suspect area because A is non suspect and A is non suspect. To this end the analysis component can be configured to remove non suspect areas from diagnostic assistance. In this way one or more suspect areas or problems area can be identified and non suspect areas can be filtered or removed from consideration thereby reducing a number of components a technician may need to examine in order to diagnose a problem arising from a DTC. For example a subset of diagnostic assistance suggestions can be determined by removing one or more of the diagnostic assistance suggestions from consideration such as the diagnostic assistance suggestions classified as non suspect. In other words the subset can be provided based on the classification of one or more of the areas or components for example. In one or more embodiments a diagnostic assistance suggestion can include an instruction to inspect one or more areas classified as suspect and be ranked based on a likelihood of failure or historical data compiled within the diagnostic assistance library .

Additionally the analysis component can be configured to generate an event report which includes a summary of one or more of the parameters from the snapshot. Further the analysis component can be configured to cross reference a repair history associated with a vehicle to rank filter remove or add diagnostic assistance suggestions to custom diagnostic assistance. In one or more embodiments the analysis component can be off board of the Vehicle A as illustrated in . In other embodiments the analysis component can be on board the Vehicle A as will be described in .

According to one or more embodiments the suggestions can be provided in a variety of ways. For example a driver could initiate a voice command or a request for assistance by asking Why do my tires wear so quickly or I need help with my tires . The input component can receive the voice command route the voice command over one or more CANs to the telematics component which could transmit the voice command off board such as to a third party or a server where it may be determined that the driver should be enrolled in a driving analytics program. In response to this the consent component can be configured to prompt the driver of the vehicle to enroll in a driving analytics program such as through a display or an audio prompt.

The driving analytics program could utilize the snapshot component and the trigger component to track the driving habits of the driver. These driving habits could then be analyzed or used to provide suggestions for mitigating wear and tear on the vehicle. Driving habits can generally include one or more driving actions of a driver. For example a driving action can be a hard brake a quick acceleration a sharp turn etc. Driving actions may be associated with an action taken by a driver which causes a corresponding sensor to exceed a threshold. As an example a quick acceleration may be associated with a longitudinal G sensor reading which exceeds a threshold.

In one or more embodiments the consent component can be configured to prompt the driver of a vehicle to enroll or opt into a driving analytics program based on one or more observed driving habits driving patterns or driving actions of the driver. In other words the consent component can be configured to prompt enrollment based on snapshot data or characteristics indicative of aggressive driving such as tread depth etc. That is if it is observed that tires of a vehicle are on pace to wear out more quickly than recommended the consent component could prompt the driver of the vehicle to enroll in a driving analytics program. In other embodiments a driver can be prompted to enroll at a dealership such as when a technician observes a low tread depth. The consent component can prompt a driver for consent utilizing the interface component to display a message for prompting the driver to enroll. For example the interface component can be configured to display scrolling text such as Did you know that at the rate you re driving you ll require an oil change 1 000 miles sooner than the average driver To enroll in a driving analytics program for driving suggestions or analysis please press and hold the power button on your radio now . In response a driver could enroll in the driving analytics program by making a selection through the input component e.g. pressing and holding the power button or replying with a voice command e.g. through an audio component not shown such as I accept or Please enroll me . The input component can be configured to pass a response from the driver to the consent component or the telematics component thereby enrolling or not enrolling the driver based on the response or selection.

The storage component can be configured to receive or store one or more snapshot packages for driving analytics. In one or more embodiments driving analytics snapshot packages can be pre loaded or pre programmed within the storage component . The parameters of the snapshot can generally be measured from one or more corresponding components. A snapshot package can include a trigger configured to capture data associated with wear and tear of a vehicle when a threshold of a parameter is exceeded such as a yaw rate horizontal G sensor longitudinal G sensor steering angle speed acceleration deceleration vertical G sensor etc. Similarly one or more parameters of the snapshot package can be indicative of a driving pattern of a driver and include the wear and tear parameters such as a yaw rate horizontal G sensor longitudinal G sensor steering angle speed acceleration deceleration vertical G sensor etc. In one or more embodiments the snapshot package can be configured to capture global positioning system GPS data associated with the vehicle. This GPS data can be used to facilitate predictions of when and where a driver will take a driving action associated with wear and tear on a vehicle.

In one or more embodiments a snapshot package can be customized or generated off board of the vehicle and received by the telematics component . In these embodiments the snapshot package may be generated based on attributes or components of interest to the driver. For example if a driver asks Please monitor my tire wear for me the input component can receive this request pass it to the consent component or telematics component via one or more CANs and receive a snapshot package from a third party via the telematics component . Here the snapshot package can be configured to capture one or more parameters related to or associated with tire wear. For example the snapshot package may include acceleration readings horizontal G sensor readings steering angle yaw rate etc. In one or more embodiments the snapshot package can be configured to trigger based on a condition or trigger based on a time interval as to collect a broader set of data to analyze. This would enable a parameter versus time analysis. For example by collecting snapshot data when a driver is driving it could be determined that a driver drives quickly in the morning due to a commute to work and slower in the evening when leaving. In this scenario the suggestion component can suggest that the driver leave the house ten minutes earlier to mitigate tire wear so that the driver will not be rushed. Therefore the suggestion component can be configured to provide suggestions that do not directly relate to driving slower. In this example the suggestion can be based on a level of anxiety associated with the driver due to traffic or work pressure for example. In other embodiments the suggestion component can suggest that the driver slow down or take turns less hard.

The trigger component can be configured to monitor one or more CANs for an occurrence of a trigger for a snapshot package stored by the storage component . When the trigger component detects an occurrence of the trigger the snapshot component can issue a record data command across one or more CANs so that corresponding components or additional components capture or record one or more of the parameters according to the snapshot package. A resulting snapshot can be stored in the storage component .

The telematics component can be configured to transmit a snapshot to a third party by way of a telematics channel for example. A snapshot can be passed from a storage component over one or more CANs to the telematics component for transmission. The third party may analyze the snapshot off board generate and transmit one or more driving analytics suggestions to the vehicle. The telematics component can be configured to receive one or more of the driving analytics suggestions from the third party.

The suggestion component can be configured to provide suggestions or analysis to the driver related to wear and tear. In other words the suggestions or analysis can enable a driver to understand why components of his or her vehicle wear at the rate they wear. Driving analytics suggestions or analysis can be provided based on the snapshot taken by the snapshot component . These suggestions can be made to improve fuel economy tire wear brake wear engine wear wear on rotors and pads etc. In one or more embodiments the suggestion component can utilize the interface component to display scrolling text or to flash a light or LED to alert a driver when an action of the driver is determined to impact wear and tear on the vehicle or components of the vehicle in a negative manner.

In one or more embodiments the suggestion component can be configured to generate a report indicative of one or more driving patterns of a driver. For example the report can be a summary of one or more driving patterns or driving actions associated with a driver. If a driver often accelerates unnecessarily before stopping at a red light at an intersection the suggestion component can note this pattern and provide suggestions accordingly. For example a driving analytics suggestion could instruct a driver to not accelerate quickly when an intersection with a traffic light is approaching based on GPS data from the telematics component and driving patterns from a snapshot. Additionally if a driver brakes harder during certain times of the day days of the week seasons etc. the suggestion component can note the braking pattern. Additionally driving patterns can be geographical. For example a driver may drive more aggressively within a home region or a radius from a familiar region. In this way the suggestion component can be configured to determine driving patterns for a driver.

Further these driving patterns can be reported to the driver in a report or a driving report. A driving report may be a summary or a collection of details patterns trends statistics etc. associated with a driver. For example a driving report may include average speed number of hard brakes habits that should be changed e.g. such as accelerating to a red light driving styles fuel economy etc. In one or more embodiments the suggestion component can be configured to prepare a driving report card for the driver. For example a driver may score well with regard to fuel economy because the car is a gasoline electric hybrid but score poorly in another category such as tire wear because the driver takes turns too hard. In one or more embodiments the driving report card can rank the driver against one or more other drivers participating in the driving analytics program.

In one or more embodiments the suggestion component can be configured to suggest different tiers of automobile insurance coverage based on a snapshot a driving report or a driving report card. The snapshot can effectively be raw data collected by the vehicle while the driving report may be a summary of driving patterns or driving actions over a period of time. As an example the suggestion component can be configured to suggest higher coverage limits to an aggressive driver associated with multiple sharp turns hard brakes quick acceleration etc.

Additionally the suggestion component can be configured to coach a driver with suggestions on how to improve his or her driving habits or actions. The suggestion component can be configured to present one or more driving analytics suggestions based on an audio prompt or a display. For example the suggestion component can interface with an audio component to play a tone when a driver accelerates too quickly. In one or more embodiments the audio prompt can include a message such as slow down to X miles per hour . Further the suggestion component can be coupled with the telematics component to provide suggestions to a driver in real time as they are driving. For example the suggestion component could be configured to alert a driver that the driver committed an action that could be associated with reducing a lifespan of a component of the vehicle such as That turn was too fast try ten miles per hour next time or If you continue taking turns at this speed your tires will need to be replaced at 80 000 miles rather than 100 000 miles .

Further the suggestion component can be configured to make driving analytics suggestions related to the maintenance of one or more components of a vehicle. For example the suggestion component could be configured to complement a check engine light with a comment on a lifespan of a component of the vehicle. For example if a check engine light comes on that is related to tire wear the suggestion component could provide a suggestion to the driver such as Please replace your tires soon or around 50 000 miles as this is due to your driving habits. If you would like to extend the life of your next set of tires please enroll in the driving analytics program and follow the prompts accordingly .

In one or more embodiments the suggestion component can be configured to provide suggestions in advanced based on a proposed route or predicted route provided by the telematics component . For example if a driver has entered a destination on a GPS unit the telematics component can calculate a route from a current location of the vehicle to the destination. Along the route when a turn is being approached the suggestion component can be configured to provide driving analytics suggestions in advance of a potential anticipated or predicted driver action that may negatively impact vehicle wear and tear. In other words if a driver has a history of taking turns too quickly the suggestion component can interface with the telematics component to determine one or more potential problem driving areas e.g. such as a turn and provide the driver with driving analytics suggestions prior to the driver reaching one or more of the potential problem driving areas. Here if a driver is approaching a turn e.g. that is a threshold distance of 100 yards away the suggestion component can be configured to issue a warning slow down to ten miles per hour before turning right onto Main Street . Stated another way the suggestion component can be configured to predict or anticipated an action of a driver based on a driving pattern or snapshot data from the driver and issue a preventative warning to the driver in advance so the driver can mitigate wear and tear on the vehicle such as by mitigating the predicted action. In this way the suggestion component can be configured to predict one or more driving actions of a driver.

Further topological data can be used to predict a driver action. For example if a turn is located at a bottom of a steep hill the suggestion component may predict that a driver will take that turn too hard or too quickly. In one or more embodiments the suggestion component can be configured to provide one or more driving analytics suggestions based on the topological data driving patterns of the driver or snapshot data etc. For example the suggestion component can suggest that a driver downshift to a lower gear at a top of a hill to mitigate tire wear from the turn at the bottom of the hill. In this way one or more driving analytics suggestions can be presented to the driver based on a predicted driving action for the driver of the vehicle thereby coaching a driver to mitigate wear and tear or improve fuel economy etc.

The server component can be configured to receive a snapshot where the snapshot includes a set of one or more parameters from one or more corresponding components of a vehicle. Snapshots can be stored in a driving database for future reference or to create a historical database. In this way trends can be analyzed across multiple vehicles or across multiple regions. For example drivers in on the East Coast may drive more aggressively on the whole than drivers from the Midwest. In this way driving analytics suggestions can be tuned by region. As an example a driver in New York may be more aggressive with regard to tire wear due to traffic but still be interested in fuel economy. As such driving analytics suggestions can be presented or filtered by region.

In one or more embodiments the analysis component can be configured to analyze the snapshot or parameters of the snapshot and generated one or more driving analytics suggestions based on the snapshot. This means that the analysis component can determine trends from the snapshot data or in conjunction with other data such as time a GPS trace topological data etc. One or more of the driving analytics suggestions can be presented to the driver to improve fuel economy and wear and tear on components of the vehicle.

Additionally the analysis component can be configured to generate a driving report or a driving report card based on the snapshot or data from the driving database . In one or more embodiments thresholds for triggering the snapshot can be obtained from the driving database . For example average values for one or more parameters can be used to populate parameters used to trigger a snapshot. Similarly portions of the driving report card can be generated based on data from the driving database . As an example a driver can be ranked against drivers within the same state city locality etc. by comparing snapshot data for the driver against snapshot data of other drivers stored in the driving database .

In one or more embodiments the driving database can store historical snapshots and GPS data from the driver and the analysis component can determine one or more driving habits or driving patterns accordingly. For example if a driver tends to brake hard at a specific intersection the snapshots and GPS data from the driving database can be used to determine such a driving pattern. Further the analysis component can generate one or more driving analytics suggestions or a driving report that is indicative of this driving pattern. Accordingly a predicted driving action can be determined based on a bearing of a driver or a route the driver is taking and the driving pattern or a series of snapshots. As an example a driving analytics suggestion could be provided to the driver prior to the driver reaching the intersection Dear driver you are approaching the intersection of X and Y where you often brake quickly. Please reduce your speed gradually . In this way telematics or GPS data can be utilized in conjunction with the snapshot or a series of snapshots from the driving database to predict a driving action and provide driving analytics suggestions accordingly. In other words historical snapshots or driving patterns can be used to predict driving actions of a driver.

In one or more embodiments the server component can be configured to transmit one or more of the driving analytics suggestions to the vehicle. For example the transmitting can be based on a telematics channel. The vehicle can receive one or more of the driving analytics suggestions and present one or more of the driving analytics suggestions to the driver of the vehicle.
