In one embodiment the client devices may be any wireless or wired electronic devices capable of receiving and transmitting data over wired and wireless mediums. For example the client devices may be one or more of personal computers laptop computers netbook computers wireless music players portable telephone communication devices smart phones tablets and digital televisions. In one embodiment the client devices are digital devices that include a hardware processor memory hierarchy and input output I O interfaces including a wired and or wireless interface such as an IEEE 802.3 interface. In one embodiment the configuration of the components within the client devices may be similar to those discussed above in relation to the access point .

In one embodiment the cloud configuration server may be any wireless or wired electronic devices capable of receiving and transmitting data over wired and wireless mediums. For example the cloud configuration server may be a personal computer a laptop computer a netbook computer or any other computing device. In one embodiment the cloud configuration server is a digital device that includes a hardware processor memory hierarchy and input output I O interfaces including a wired and or wireless interface such as an IEEE 802.3 interface. In one embodiment the configuration of the components within the cloud configuration server may be similar to those discussed above in relation to the access point .

In one embodiment the cloud configuration server may receive and store environmental and operational parameters received from one or more of the access points and along with standards and threshold requirements for each wireless network and . These standards and threshold requirements may be defined in a set of service level agreements stored on the cloud configuration server . In some embodiments the cloud configuration server may also store network configuration information for each network and . This network configuration information may be passed to one or more access points and such that the access points and may join associate with a corresponding wireless network and .

The method may begin at operation with one or more access points and detecting environmental and or operational characteristics parameters or values related to the access points and . For example the access points and may each detect 1 the number of client devices each access point and is connected to or associated with 2 the amount of traffic on each access point and 3 the signal strength of the client devices connected to or associated with each access point and 4 radio frequency characteristics of the environment surrounding each access point and e.g. radio frequency interference may be detected in the immediate area surrounding the access point as a result of a proximate microwave oven and 5 a listing of neighboring access points and in another network and e.g. the access point may be detected to be visible in range in relation to the access point . For example at operation the access point may determine that two client devices are connected to it the traffic on the access point is 20 Mbps the signal strength of each client device connected to the access point is 10 dBm and 20 dBm respectively there is high distortion in the 2.4 Ghz band surrounding the access point and the access point is proximate to the access point . Each access point and may detect similar parameters at operation based on their own environmental and or operational characteristics.

After detecting environmental and or operational parameters associated with each access point and operation transmits these detected parameters to the cloud configuration server . The transmission may be performed over external network using any known set of transmission protocols or standards e.g. IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 . In one embodiment a master access point may be designated or elected in each network and . For example in the wireless network the access point may be designated as the master access point and maintains a connection with the cloud configuration server through the external network . Similarly in the wireless network the access point may be designated as the master access point and maintains a connection with the cloud configuration server through the external network . In this embodiment each access point and transmits parameters detected at operation to the master access points and respectively. These master access points and may transmit the collected parameters from each of the access points and in their respective networks and to the cloud configuration server at operation .

At operation the environmental and or operational parameters are received by the cloud configuration server . The cloud configuration server may thereafter process the received parameters as will be described in further detail below. Although described in relation to a separate digital device receiving and analyzing the detected parameters e.g. the cloud configuration server in other embodiments an access point within the network may analyze the parameters and trigger an access point in the network to join the network without assistance from a device external to the networks and . This configuration will be discussed in further detail in relation to .

At operation the received parameters are analyzed to determine whether one or more standard and or threshold requirements for the wireless networks and have not been met. As noted above these standards and or threshold requirements may be dictated by service level agreements between customers and operators of the networks and . For example a threshold requirement for the wireless network may be that each access point not exceed a traffic limit of 15 Mbps. In the example above in relation to operation 20 Mbps traffic was detected on the access point . Accordingly in this example the threshold requirement for traffic not exceeding 15 Mbps on each access point in wireless network has been violated and operation would detect a failure to meet the threshold requirement.

In one embodiment the threshold requirements for the network are determined relative to a schedule with a designated time. For example a threshold requirement for the network may indicate that a particular amount of client devices and or a particular amount of traffic is needed at a designated time. Accordingly the cloud configuration server may determine whether the current set of access points in the network can meet this scheduled threshold requirement at operation .

Following a determination that a threshold requirement for the wireless network has not been met operation attempts to identify an access point in the wireless network that may be moved over to wireless network such that the violated threshold requirement of the network is now met. The identified access point must have the capacity and positioning to handle the needs of the wireless network such that any violated threshold requirements are now met. For example an identified access point must be proximate to the wireless network and or one or more overloaded access points such that the identified access point may effectively associate with client devices in the area of the wireless network . Although the networks and serve separate areas the close proximity between the networks and may allow one or more of the access points in the network to provide service to client devices in the area of the network . The positioning of the access points relative to the access points may be determined based on detected parameters received from the access points and at operation . For example a listing of neighboring access points in the network may be detected by each access point at operation .

In one embodiment operation is performed such that wireless network does not fail to meet any of its own threshold requirements. For example removing the access point from network and moving it to the network may allow the network meet each of its threshold requirements however this adjustment may result in the network failing one or more of its own threshold requirements. Accordingly operation must identify and access point for movement to the network that will not cause the network to fail to meet its own threshold requirements.

Although described in relation to identifying a single access point in the network in some embodiments multiple access points may be identified to move to the network . The multiple identified access points may collectively allow the network to meet each of its threshold requirements.

In one example operation may identify the access point to join the network . In this example the cloud configuration server may determine based on environmental and or operational parameters received at operation that the access point is properly positioned to alleviate congestion or other issues with the network such that the network may meet each of its threshold requirements without causing the network to violate any of its own threshold requirements. The access point will be used hereinafter as the identified access point that will move from the network to the network . However in other embodiments another access point may be selected to move from the network to the network .

At operation the cloud configuration server triggers the identified access point to join the network as shown in . In one embodiment the cloud configuration server may store configuration data for both the wireless network and the wireless network . The configuration data allows access points and to join each network and respectively. In one embodiment the cloud configuration server triggers the identified access point in the wireless network to join the wireless network by transmitting a request to the identified access point along with corresponding configuration information for the network . In one embodiment the request and the configuration information are routed through master access point in the network . Upon receipt of the configuration information the identified access point may break from the network and beacon for the master access point in the network . The identified access point may modify at least a portion of its own configuration using the received configuration information and thereafter join the network . By joining the network the identified access point will 1 advertise the same SSID 2 be part of the same IP subnet and or 3 point to the same virtual local area network VLAN as the access points .

In one embodiment the identified access point may simultaneously be connected to both the networks and . For example at operation the identified access point may join the network while maintaining a connection with the network . In this example the identified access point simultaneously advertises SSIDs for both the networks and .

In one embodiment the identified access point may remain in the network until the cloud configuration server determines that the identified access point is no longer needed to meet each of the network s threshold requirements at operation . For example the access points and may be in network . In this scenario the access point was identified at operation and triggered to move from the network to the network at operation such that the network may meet each of its threshold requirements. However after monitoring environmental and or operational parameters periodically received from each access point and the cloud configuration server may determine at operation that the identified access point is no longer needed in the network for the network to meet each of its threshold requirements. This may be caused in a drop in client devices associated with the network or other similar factors. Alternatively in one embodiment the cloud configuration server may determine at operation that the access point is needed in the network such that the network can meet its own threshold requirements.

Based on the determined need for the access point in the network and or the lack of need for the access point in the network the cloud configuration server may trigger the access point to rejoin the network at operation . As described above the cloud configuration server may store configuration data for both the wireless network and the wireless network . In one embodiment the cloud configuration server triggers the identified access point in the wireless network to rejoin the wireless network by transmitting a request to the identified access point along with corresponding configuration information for the network . In one embodiment the request and the configuration information are routed through master access point in the network . Upon receipt of the configuration information the identified access point may break from the network and beacon for the master access point in the network . The identified access point may modify at least a portion of its own configuration using the received configuration information and thereafter rejoin the network . By joining the network the identified access point will 1 advertise the same SSID 2 be part of the same IP subnet and or 3 point to the same virtual local area network VLAN as the access points and .

As described above the method moves one or more access points between the network and the neighboring network such that one or more threshold requirements of the network are met. By reconfiguring the access points and to move between the networks and the method provides a highly flexible network system that utilizes environmental and or operational data to dynamically meet the needs of client devices and consumers using available resources of under utilized nearby networks.

The method was described above in relation to the cloud configuration server . In some embodiments the cloud configuration server may be replaced by one or more access points and or in the wireless networks and . shows a method for dynamically grouping and configuring access points and between the wireless networks and based on detected environmental and or operational parameters. The method may be performed by one or more of the access points and in conjunction with other digital devices in the network system .

The method may begin at operation with the access points being configured to provide network access to a first set of client devices . The configuration may be performed automatically by the access points themselves through the construction of a mesh enterprise network . The network may provide Internet access or other network services through a gateway.

At operation one or more of the access points in the network may publish environmental and or operational characteristics parameters or values related to the access points . For example the access points may each publish 1 the number of client devices each access point is connected to or associated with 2 the amount of traffic on each access point 3 the signal strength of the client devices connected to or associated with each access point 4 radio frequency characteristics of the environment surrounding each access point e.g. radio frequency interference may be detected in the immediate area surrounding the access point as a result of a proximate microwave oven and 5 a listing of neighboring access points in another network e.g. the access point may be detected to be visible in range in relation to the access point . The access points in the network may publish similar detected parameters at operation as well.

In one embodiment the publication of these detected parameters may be to a master access point in the network . In this embodiment a master access point may be designated or elected in each network and . For example in the wireless network the access point may be designated as the master access point. Similarly in the wireless network the access point may be designated as the master access point.

At operation the method determines that at least one additional access point not currently in the network is needed to provide network access to the client devices . In one embodiment this determination may be made based on 1 determining at runtime of the network that a current number of client devices associated with the network is above a particular threshold 2 determining at runtime of the network that a current traffic load at at least one of the access points in the network is above a particular threshold 3 determining that a received signal strength for one or more signals transmitted between one or more of the client devices and one or more of the access points in the network is below a particular threshold and or 4 determining an access point in the network is better suited to provide network access to one or more of the client devices than at least one access point in the network . In one embodiment these standards and or thresholds may be dictated by service level agreements.

In one embodiment the service level agreements for the network are determined relative to a schedule with a designated time. For example a service level agreement for the network may indicate that a particular amount of client devices and or a particular amount of traffic is needed at a designated time. Accordingly the cloud configuration server may determine whether the current set of access points in the network can meet this scheduled service level agreement at operation or whether at least one additional access point not currently in the network is needed to provide network access to the anticipated client devices .

In one embodiment this determination may be made by the master access point in the network . For example the master access point may receive detected parameters from each access point in the network and determine whether each service level agreement for the network is met based on these detected parameters such that network access is provided to the client devices in the network . In one embodiment this determination at operation may be made in conjunction with the master access point of the network .

Following the determination that at least one additional access point not currently in the network is needed to provide network access to the client devices operation adds at least one access point to the network as shown in . Adding the additional access points to the network allows the network to meet each of its threshold requirements. For example the additional access points may increase the capacity of the network or increase the signal strength to one or more of the client devices . In one embodiment the master access point adds the additional access points to the network based on a listing of stored access points. The listing may include identifying information of access points not currently in but available to join the network . In one embodiment one or more of the access points in the network are added to the network at operation . The determination of which and how many access points may be made by the master access point such that the network access for the client devices is provided without restricting network access to the client devices and in the network .

In one embodiment operation may transmit a request to join and configuration information corresponding to the network to the one or more identified access points in the network . For example operation may send a request and configuration information to the access point . Upon receipt of the configuration information the identified access point may break from the network and beacon for the master access point in the network . The identified access point may modify at least a portion of its own configuration using the received configuration information and thereafter join the network . By joining the network the identified access point will 1 advertise the same SSID 2 be part of the same IP subnet and or 3 point to the same virtual local area network VLAN as the access points .

In one embodiment the identified access point may simultaneously be connected to both the networks and . For example at operation the identified access point may join the network while maintaining a connection with the network . In this example the identified access point simultaneously advertises SSIDs for both the networks and .

At operation the method may determine that one or more access points in the network are not needed to provide network access to the client devices . For example the previously identified access points may no longer be needed by the network to provide network access to the client devices . This may be caused in a drop in client devices associated with the network or other similar factors. Alternatively in one embodiment operation may determine that the access point is needed in the network such that the network can provide network access to the client devices and .

Based on the determined need for the access point in the network and or the lack of need for the access point in the network operation may trigger the access point to rejoin the network . In one embodiment operation triggers the identified access point in the wireless network to rejoin the wireless network by transmitting a request to the identified access point along with corresponding configuration information for the network . In one embodiment the request and the configuration information are received from the master access point in the network . Upon receipt of the configuration information the identified access point may break from the network and beacon for the master access point in the network . The identified access point may modify at least a portion of its own configuration using the received configuration information and thereafter rejoin the network . By joining the network the identified access point will 1 advertise the same SSID 2 be part of the same IP subnet and or 3 point to the same virtual local area network VLAN as the access points and .

As described above the method moves one or more access points between the network and the neighboring network such that network access is provided to client devices connected to the network . By reconfiguring the access points and to move between the networks and the method provides a highly flexible network system that utilizes environmental and or operational data to dynamically meet the needs of client devices and consumers using available resources of under utilized nearby networks.
