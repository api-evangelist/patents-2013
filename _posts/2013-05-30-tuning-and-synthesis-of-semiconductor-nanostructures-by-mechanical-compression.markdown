The present invention relates to semiconductor nanostructures and in particular to a method for the tuning and synthesis of semiconductor nanostructures by mechanical compression.

Nanoparticles e.g. sizes below about 100 nm of II VI semiconductor compounds have been known to exhibit quantum confinement. Quantum confinement results when the electrons in a material are confined to a very small volume. Quantum confinement is size and shape dependent meaning the properties of the nanoparticles are tunable based on their size and shape. Such nanoparticles may have applications in opto electronic devices laser diodes nanosensing and biomedical imaging. However there remains a need for a method to synthesize semiconductor compounds in other nanostructure architectures that may exhibit quantum confinement.

The present invention is directed to a method for tuning nanoparticle lattice structure and the synthesis of semiconductor nanostructures by mechanical compression comprising providing a semiconductor nanoparticle assembly and mechanical compressing the nanoparticle assembly. The semiconductor nanoparticles can comprise II VI or IV VI semiconductors including CdSe CdTe ZnSe ZnS PbS and PbSe. The nanoparticle lattice structures can be tuned to reversibly shrink and swell when the applied pressure or stress is less than a threshold pressure using a diamond anvil cell or other means of mechanical compression. For example for CdSe nanoparticles assemblies the threshold pressure is about 8 GPa. Reversible tuning of the interparticle distance below the threshold pressure enables the investigation of interparticle spacing dependent physical properties such as surface plasmonic resonances that result from the coupling of nanoparticles under compression. Such control of the interparticle distance by mechanical compression can be useful for charge or energy transfer based device applications in sensing photovoltaic and surface plasmonic imaging. When the applied stress is over the threshold pressure the nanoparticle assemblies begin to contact coalesce and sinter together to irreversibly form a completely new semiconductor nanostructure. For example the new semiconductor nanostructure can comprise a dimer trimer nanorod nanowire nanosheet or other three dimensional architecture. Such new nanostructures may exhibit quantum confinement.

The present invention is directed to a mechanical compression method for tuning nanoparticle lattice structure and the synthesis of new semiconductor nanostructures including nanorods nanowires nanosheets and three dimensional 3D interconnected structures. II VI or IV VI compound semiconductor nanoparticle assemblies can be used as starting materials including CdSe CdTe ZnSe ZnS PbSe and PbS as well as other semiconductors including Ge. For example ordered spherical CdSe nanoparticle assemblies can be used as starting materials. According to the invention pressure can be applied to periodically ordered assemblies of such nanoparticles. Gradual elevation of external pressure from ambient condition up to a threshold pressure induces shrinkage of the lattice of the ordered assemblies and causes shrinkage of interparticle spacing within the ordered assemblies. Further increasing of pressure over threshold drives the nanoparticles to contact coalesce and finally weld sinter to form new nanostructures. Dispersion of the sintered nanostructures in organic solvents results in uniform single nanostructures that can reassemble into ordered arrays upon evaporation of the solvent. Depending on the size of the nanoparticles and orientation of the initial ordered assemblies new nanostructures such as nanorods nanowires and nanosheets can be synthesized. For example nanowires that are uniform in diameter can have very close to the diameter of the initial nanoparticles and length of a few hundreds nanometers to a few micrometers. Additionally nanosheets or 3D interconnected structures can also be synthesized in this process by using different sizes of nanoparticles.

A diamond anvil cell DAC can be used to mechanically compress the semiconductor nanoparticle assemblies. A DAC consists of two opposing diamonds with a sample compressed between the culets. Pressure may be monitored using a reference material such as ruby fluorescence whose behavior under pressure is known. The uniaxial pressure supplied by the DAC may be transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure using a pressure transmitting medium. The pressure transmitting medium is enclosed by a gasket and the two diamond anvils. is a schematic illustration of a DAC that can be used for mechanical compression of a nanoparticle assembly. The nanoparticle assembly can be embedded in a polymer e.g. polystyrene film as the pressure transmitting medium. Transparency of the DAC allows in situ optical characterizations of interparticle spacing based physics and monitoring of the structural evolution of the nanoparticle assembly using synchrotron x ray scattering. In particular in situ small SAXS and wide angle WAXS synchrotron X ray scattering measurements on the same spot of a sample under pressure coupled with transmission electron microscopy TEM enable reconstruction of the ordering of nanoparticles to form nanorods and nanosheets upon mechanical compression. Other moderate and high pressure compression devices can also be used such as piston cylinder devices multi anvil cells or embossing machines. Further mechanical compression can be applied to nanoparticles between two flat surfaces between two patterned surfaces between flat and patterned surfaces and in liquid or solid media. The external pressure can be used to overcome specific interparticle interactions enabling engineering of the nanoparticle assembly by allowing fine tuning of lattice structure and interparticle separation distance and to fabricate new nanoparticle architectures. In particular pressure directed nanoparticle assembly enables production of chemically and mechanically stable nanostructures which are not possible using current top down and bottom up methods.

As an example of the invention CdSe nanoparticles with various sizes were synthesized according to a modified literature method. See Z. Adam Peng and Xiaogang Peng 123 183 2001 . Cadmium oxide CdO was dissolved in octadecylphosphonic acid ODPA and trioctylphosphine oxide TOPO to generate a homogeneous solution at high temperature. Introduction of selenium stock solution yielded high quality nanocrystals. The resulting CdSe nanoparticles with diameters of 3 nm and 5.5 nm were used in the experiments described below. 80 mg of CdSe nanoparticles and 20 mg polystyrene were dissolved in 1 mL toluene. An appropriate amount of this solution was drop cast onto a silicon wafer to form a film comprising a periodically ordered assembly of CdSe nanoparticles. A piece of the CdSe nanoparticle film about 100 m in diameter was loaded into a DAC for nanostructure synthesis and in situ pressure measurement.

Two gem quality diamond anvils with a culet size of 500 m were aligned to generate pressure. A stainless steel gasket was pre indented and the thickness reduced from 250 m down to 70 m. A 250 m diameter hole was drilled and served as the sample chamber. Silicone oil was used as the pressure transmitting fluid. The pressure in the diamond cell was determined using a standard pressure dependent ruby fluorescent method. In situ high pressure small angle and wide angle X ray scattering HP SAXS and HP WAXS measurements were performed at room temperature at an angle dispersive synchrotron beamline at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source CHESS . White synchrotron x ray beam was optimized at the monochromatic wavelength of 0.7749 using two Ge single crystals cut at 111 . A collimator was used to reduce the beam down to 100 m and a Mar345 image plate detector was use to collect SAXS and WAXS patterns. The distance between sample and detector was calibrated by Ag behenate and CeOstandard for SAXS and WAXS respectively. The collected X ray diffraction patterns were integrated by the Fit2D software Andrew P. Hammersley. European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ESRF . Upon pressure release the sample was carefully removed from the gasket and cleaned using a small amount of solvents e.g. toluene and ethanol . High resolution transmission electron microscopy HRTEM a UV Vis NIR spectrophotometer and a fluorometer were used to characterize and analyze the samples before and after application of pressure.

The new nanostructures formed above the threshold pressure can be re dispersed in an organic solvent and recovered by evaporation of the solvent. shows is an example of the formation of nanowires as a result of irreversible compression of 5.5 nm CdSe nanoparticles above the threshold pressure. is a TEM image of recovered CdSe nanowires. These nanowires have diameters e.g. 6 nm very similar to the diameters of the starting nanoparticles e.g. 5.5 nm . is a HRTEM image of the CdSe nanowires showing the sintered interface along each nanowire.
