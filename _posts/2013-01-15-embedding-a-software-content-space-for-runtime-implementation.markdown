The present invention relates to software development and more specifically to systems and methods for embedding a content space into a software product for use at run time of the software product.

As part of developing products and applications particularly software products and applications requirements are determined usually from a wide variety of sources such as stake holders strategy people customers marketing industry trends standards organizations and more. Through various channels a detailed technical plan of activities for the software development team is derived from the requirements which can interact in complex ways. The process of generating detailed implementation plans from requirements is subject to errors from various sources. Multiple concurrent dialogs among teams making assumptions and decisions in parallel can propagate errors which can become built into the project plans and the product architecture and or designs. As such business results such as time to market development cost product viability to compete in the marketplace and the like can affected.

Use cases have long been implemented to organize and itemize requirements for software products or application software. Use cases bridge the gap between business and market knowledge and system design by focusing on the user interactions with the system. The breakdown of requirements into use case or line items frequently occurs in parallel with and is in dialog with the architects and design leaders. During the time frame that requirements are collected and analyzed the requirements are subject to change which must be reflected in the line items or use cases. In addition new requirements are brought up and must be analyzed and fit with the existing line items or use cases. Some requirements are eliminated with corresponding impacts on line items or use cases. Use cases continue to have problems of various kinds such as questions of completeness understandability uniqueness and manageability. What is needed is a method for generating user stories that leads to less rework accelerated delivery and better business value and to embed those user stories into the software product for use at runtime.

Additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. For a better understanding of the invention with the advantages and the features refer to the description and to the drawings.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein embed a content space within a software product for availability for normal use at run time. For illustrative purposes the systems and methods described herein are largely discussed in the context of overall system management software set of products e.g. Java associated build tools development and test environments and the like. It will be appreciated that the examples described herein can be readily transposed to other software product environments by those skilled in the art.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein implement a content space represented internally shippable and useable at run time. In addition the systems and methods described herein implement an internal interface for the software product s internal functional parts to access the content space at run time e.g. an internal callable set of interfaces that are used by product code . The systems and methods described herein further obtain and set attributes to each cell in the content space. The attributes are used for various purposes by the run time functions access content space. Some example attributes include but are not limited to 1 cell category 2 cell requirements 3 development owner 4 test owner 5 graphical user interface GUI panel ID 6 instances needed and the like. The systems and methods described herein further integrate a run time content space within a normal software product build process. In addition the systems and methods described herein update the content space definition within the software product after the software is installed similar to updating other components of the software product .

As described herein a content space model is implemented for not only collecting requirements and generating user stories but also for embedding into the software product. A content space is a way of representing software content from an outside in perspective via a set of dimensions. Each of the content space dimensions has values defined in terms of the software itself that concern a particular aspect such as information abstraction function external interface and run time environment. The dimension values can represent existing content and also new content for the software based on requirements via content space analysis for a new release. The content space can be programmatically traversed and as this traversal occurs end to end testable units termed user stories are output each corresponding to a particular region of the content space and having content space coordinates. The set of all output user stories partitions the software content and the set of all new and changed user stories partitions the release requirements. The set of all user stories and various subsets e.g. all Power user stories are used to compute the content coverage metric of various scopes.

An example of how a content space can be set up and implemented is now discussed. It will be appreciated that the following example is illustrative of a content space and not limiting.

In exemplary embodiments the content space can be a five dimensional space termed either as a software product content space or a content space such that each cell within the content space is an end to end use case i.e. agile user story . In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein can be implemented at various levels of scale from individual software components to very large products comprising hundreds of components to include in the content space and embed into the software product. The five dimensions structure the work as needed by software development i.e. design test project management and the requirements serve to define the values used on the dimensions. As such the exemplary content space servers to bridge the requirements domain and implementation domain.

In exemplary embodiments content space specification files are generated from the various sources in the requirements domain as described herein. As described further herein the content space specification files are generated from various requirements . A content space tool receives the content specification files to automatically generate the agile user stories that can be stored in a user story storage medium . An additional storage medium can be implemented to store changes to the specification files or any other suitable output during the content space generation. Once generated the agile user stories can be output to any suitable project management or test management tool implemented by the users in the development domain.

The system includes several functions including but not limited to 1 articulating the content space 2 classifying regions of the content space 3 grouping the regions of the content space 4 assigning priorities to use cases and 5 loading the project management tool .

In articulating the content space requirements are analyzed in terms of the five content space dimensions. This analysis results in with iteration and consensus building a definition of values for each of the five dimensions which is represented in a form that can be programmatically processed. In articulating the content space the systems and methods described herein address whether all the requirements are represented in the content space whether each content space dimension value is properly defined and agreed upon and whether all the dimension values are related to explicit implicit or future requirements.

In classifying the regions of the content space once the team is satisfied that the content space is defined i.e. all dimension values known understood and reasonably well defined and that it does encompass all the requirements for a selected time frame the team next decides on how to classify regions of the content space. Through automated systems with team decisions every cell in the content space is categorized in a variety of types including but not limited to 1 does not apply to the product 2 does apply to the product but for some future release 3 is part of the product today or from some prior release and has no enhancements or changes 4 is part of the product today and is enhanced or changed in some way and 5 is a new or an enhanced function. The systems and methods described herein determine whether each content space dimension value is classified and reviews of the results determine correctness.

Following agreement on the content space and categorization of regions the content space regions are then grouped. Subsets of the content space are grouped together into a size which is desirable for project management and the scale of the product and teams. This step applies particularly to the content space regions classified as unchanged and new or enhanced changed . The two extremes are an entire content space can grouped into a single output project management work item or at the other extreme every single content space cell can be output as a single project management line item. Essentially every possible grouping in between these extremes is also supported. Typically used are grouping all new and changed user stories for a particular platform or grouping specific sub variations of a verb.

In exemplary embodiments there is flexibility in how these regions are selected and how they related to the content space cell classifications. The systems and methods described herein determine whether the grouping is correct and do the groupings properly reflect the tradeoff between project management needs and technical visibility based on classifications and complexity.

The grouping of content space cells into right sized project management work items mostly focused on a new function and an existing and unchanged function. The user team can programmatically select the grouping of content space cells based on many considerations such overall content space size product size degree of technical difficulty of new function team size number of team and the like. In exemplary embodiments individual content cells are use cases with adjustable granularity and the groupings are user functions or user stories.

Based on the relative priorities of requirements regions of the content space subsets of use cases are assigned priority values. These can be used to help focus review sessions to ensure the right higher priority content is defined. When loaded into a project management application the priorities can be used directly by development in agile sprint iteration planning. The output project management work items are input e.g. import for example from the user story storage medium into an appropriate project management tool .

As described herein a content space can be defined by five dimensions. In exemplary embodiments the five dimensions of the content space are in order release time noun verb interface and platform. The three dimensions verb interface and platform are orthogonal and noun specific. That is an instance of these e.g. a verb set an interface set and a platform set is defined for each noun of interest. Nouns are the fourth dimension. The combination of a noun and its associated 3D space is termed a noun space . A set of noun spaces at a given point in time usually associated with product release constitute the definition of the content space for a particular release of a product when the point in time is chosen on a release calendar boundary . Instances a product content space for multiple releases represent the fifth dimension of content space time.

For illustrative purposes an example of a software product a hypothetical browser based email client is discussed for ease of discussion. It will be appreciated that other products are contemplated for which an embedded content space can be implemented.

The platform dimension is interpreted broadly to include the hardware operating system middle ware hypervisor and language runtime in which the product executes. Generally meaningful platform elements are determined by each product. As such the entire prerequisite software stack and hardware is considered. Values of the platform dimension can include specific releases of each of these platform components as needed or can be more generally specified. For example a platform might be AIX 5.2 or just AIX. Alternatively the platform might be Firefox 3.6 or better or just Firefox. Values can include as needed ancillary hardware for storage networking hardware management controllers firmware etc. for the full functional system configuration.

The interface dimension has values chosen to identify and separate the kinds of interfaces that the subject software presents to external entities people other software or hardware. The values can be specified by type such as Graphical User Interface GUI command line interface CLI and so on. The values can include programmable interfaces such as web services e.g. REST and APIs. Protocols can also be specified as values e.g. IPv6 or MPI Message Processing Interface used in super computing environments .

The verb dimension includes values such as functions or operations that are supported by the subject software for a particular noun. The operations may be specified at varying levels of granularity depending upon the needs of a given set of requirements. For example copy or create might be sufficient. More fine grained values such copy to like repository and copy to new folder can also be used. The decision depends on considerations like how new the function is or how critical the different forms of copy are to the product stake holders those that define requirements or how technically difficult to implement.

The noun dimension is an abstract entity presented to externals via the interface s . Most software for direct use by people has a number of such abstractions that people manipulate via the functions verbs presented by the software. Example nouns for an email client can include but are not limited to inbox inbox email folder and draft email. As with values on the above dimensions there is flexibility in how coarse grained or fine grained the nouns are defined. The right level of noun dimension granularity for a given product and given release depends on the requirements.

The time dimension values include natural values i.e. discrete units which are the releases planned for the product. The content space for release n 1 can be various additions and changes relative to the release n content space. These additions enhancements and other changes affect the release n content space by changing the values defined on the various dimensions. New nouns new verbs new platforms can all be added. Enhancements to exiting nouns and verbs are common and defined explicitly in the n 1 content space.

Because of the way the dimensions are defined each generated user story is an end to end testable unit of function sometimes termed FVT able where FVT Function Verification Test . For example for an email client each user story is a cell in the five dimensional space with coordinates of release noun verb interface and platform. For example send an email on Firefox via GUI release n is represented by a 5 tuple release n email send GUI Firefox as shown in .

In grouping user stories a set of user stories is represented in output as a single user story. For example all the user stories for platform ABC or for function XYZ might be represented by a single output user story. Grouping does not change the size of a content space. Grouping allows the number of output user stories to be directly managed without eliminating any details from the CS specification. There is no limit on the size of a user story group. In exemplary embodiments grouping is controlled by the user by filters in the content space specification file .

As filtering occurs when a filter matches a user story and the filter has any kind of grouping requested save the user story is saved in a buffer associated with the filter. After all filtering and all non grouped user stories are output. The content space tool loops through all the filters that have any kind of grouping. For each filter the content space tool performs several steps. First if a simple group is requested in the filter the content space tool generates the single grouping user story summary field description field and the like and writes to output. The content space tool then continues to the next filter. If a type of group by is requested then for each group by element e.g. noun verb ifc platform the content space tool builds subsets of the respective values on the dimension from among the buffered user stories. The content space tool then generates a single user story group for each cross dimension subset generates the description field that itemizes the subset of user stories for the group and writes the user story group.

Folding also reduces the number of output user stories like grouping. But in contrast to grouping folding reduces the size of the content space. Folding reduces the size of the content space by collecting some number of dimension element values into a single value folding operates on the content space itself while grouping operates on user stories . The resulting single value is then used as a dimension element value in place of the multiple collected values thereby reducing the size of the content space. The single resulting value is termed a folding symbol fold sym .

As described herein folding does not eliminate the details from the content space specification file. The values collected into a fold sym remain in the content space specification file and the folding done by the fold sym can be toggled on or off. The value folding can be switched on and off for each of the noun verb interface and platform dimensions independently or all four dimensions together. Hence not only are the values still in the spec file but the content space can also be processed again and user stories generated without folding or different folding to see the detail. Folding can include both dimension folding and value folding.

In exemplary embodiments the content space tool processes command line parameters to determine what kinds of folding are requested. If no fold parameter the content space tool implements the default setting for folding. As the content space specification files are read the content space tool collects a list of all fold syms and values for each. After all the noun spaces are read from input files the content space tool invokes a fold function. The content space tool implements dimension folding first if requested. For each dimension for which folding is requested the dimension is folded to in each noun space. If value folding is requested for any dimensions that have not been folded the following steps are implemented. If noun value folding the content space tool folds the noun values by removing nouns in value list of a fold sym and replace with single instance of the fold sym. For each remaining noun space for each relevant dimension the content space tool check each dimension value to see if it is in the value list of a fold sym. If the noun is in the value list of the fold sym then the content space tool removes the value and adds the fold sym once only to the dimension list. If folding has been set off the content space tool takes no action. The content space by default is loaded in this mode. If fold request for the all or similar the interface and platform dimensions are folded as above and the verb dimension is value folded for all noun spaces are folded and the noun dimension is value folded.

Referring still to at block each user story is enumerated in the content space and run through filters to classify and possibly add data. At block the user story groups are generated and at block show requests and a summary are generated. At block the content space data is embedded into a software product as described further herein.

In exemplary embodiments a content space is specified in a form that is processed read by the content space tool e.g. an agile user story generation program . The specification can be split among multiple files e.g. the content space specification files which can be processed individually or together. As such an overall product content space can be split among some number of individual architects for parallel concurrent activity and then processed as a whole.

In exemplary embodiments each content space specification file includes some number of noun spaces defined symbols and filters. A content space specification file is used to define a content space in a form that can be processed programmatically. In exemplary embodiments the specification file is implemented to generate user stories and provide various kinds of statistics about the content space enables content coverage metric automated comparisons of multiple content spaces e.g. cross release and the like. In exemplary embodiments the content space specification file includes several statements which define among other things a noun space that can include noun verb interface ifc and platform. A content space is a set of noun spaces. As such a basic content space specification file defines one or more noun spaces. Descriptive names are used for the values on all these dimensions. In exemplary embodiments additional statements can be added to the content space specification file . On statement is symbol SYM to simplify maintenance of the content space specification file by reducing redundancy across noun space definitions. Another statement is a filter statement that is used to classify user stories and to add information to output user stories. In exemplary embodiments each instance of statements as a group defines a single noun space. For example the noun statement gives the noun space a name and the other verb interface and platform statements provide the values for which each dimension is named.

As further described herein a sym statement is a simple mechanism to create a short hand for a list of values. The short hand can then be used in defining noun spaces e.g. in noun verb ifc platform statements in other sym statements and in filter statements. This implementation of sym statements therefore simplifies use and later changes to the content specification file since the list of related values can reliably changed throughout a set of specification files by changing it in only a single place. For example assume a content space has 15 noun spaces and 12 of those all use the same platform list. Then that list can defined once as a sym and that sym name used in the 12 noun spaces. The example illustrates a group of related syms that aggregates various example platforms. The sym all email env is then used to in the definition of various noun spaces for example in the draft email noun space.

The symbols that end in a trailing   underbar are fold syms as is the send  . The   indicates a symbol that can be folded. If the relevant type of value folding is requested e.g. verb value to fold verb dimension or platform value to fold platform dimension then the symbols marked with a trailing   are folded. That is the symbol itself is used in the content space when folded. If not folded the symbol s value list is used in the content space. When folded a symbol is shown in generated user stories with the trailing   so that everyone seeing the user story will know it is folded is an abstraction .

As further described herein filter statements are used to classify user stories into one of five categories n a future nochange changed or new. They also can add to a story a variety of information. A filter statement has the general structure filter . The filter expression is a logical expression i.e. evaluates to True or False based on the language of the content the content space tool . For example logical operators are supported i.e. 

In exemplary embodiments the content space specification files can implement additional statements including but not limited to 1 comment off used to end commented out block of lines 2 comment on used to start a block of comment lines. Starts skipping 3 createdby used to set the field Created By 4 csvfile sets the name of the output .csv file 5 eof logically ends file early rest of file skipped 6 include name a file to be included 7 plannedfor used to set the RTC field Planned For 8 scope used to set filter scope to file default or global 9 set filterid in summaryfield true or false default 10 set implicit folding true or false default 11 set summary prefix Default is User Story 12 set summary suffix Default is category of the user story 13 tag exclusion set Define a mutually exclusive set of tags and 14 title title label of content space.

As described herein the specification files support the definition of symbols used in the defining the values and in the filters that is used within the content space specification file itself. This format helps maintain a content space specification by lessening duplication of constants i.e. dimension values . This format also serves to help the specification file be self documenting when description names are used for the symbols. For example a list of platforms used in a prior release might be assigned to a symbol named prior platforms . This symbol is then used in the noun spaces as a short hand for the full list. This symbol can also be used in the filters.

Each use case in a content space is classified using filters into basic categories including but not limited to not applicable future regression and development. Not applicable are use cases judged to likely never be relevant for the product and future are use cases not in the n 1 release but inherent in the content space. In exemplary embodiments the content space is identified to clearly encompass the requirements to help ensure nothing is missed. In doing so some use cases are likely to be generated that are not planned for the current release.

In exemplary embodiments filters are also implemented to add information to the generated use cases. Examples of information that can be added are priority tags references to requirements document and the like.

In exemplary embodiments filters are also implemented to cause sets of use cases to be grouped into a single broader output use case. Implementing filters in this manner can be helpful in the case regression use cases where fine grained management and tracking of the individual use cases is not necessary e.g. due to the existence of automated testing built during previous releases .

In generating the agile use cases one or more content space specification files are read by the content space tool . As described herein a primary output is the user story storage medium . In exemplary embodiments the user story storage medium can have a comma separated value .csv file format which is a quasi standard widely used by many software applications. A second type of output is the additional storage medium for various summary and report like information or in progress changes.

As described herein content space data is embedded into a software product at block which is now described in further detail. In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein implement a content space represented internally shippable and useable at run time. In exemplary embodiments a logical model of the content space is structured as a table.

The first four columns represent the four relevant coordinates of the content space noun verb interface and platform. The later columns contain attributes associated with each row. Some attributes may be used only during development and test and eliminated in the general availability GA build of the content space jar. In the table there is a row for each possible set of content space coordinate values at a selected resolution. The resolution is likely to vary over the course of development and depends on the uses a particular product makes of the embedded content space and for new functions how designs evolve and relate to GUI design and the like. As an example platform values the most complex of the dimensions might represent value along this spectrum operating system operating system with version operating system with version hypervisor operating system version hypervisior with version and the like.

In exemplary embodiments the content space resolution is also likely to vary within a given product release as shipped due to functional areas of complexity and implementation maturity. New user stories are likely to need more detail that user stories from prior releases. For example as an approximate the number of rows for a average product might be as much as 1000. Physically the content space might be generated in JSON format or as a csv file. For example a JSON file might be organized as follows 

In exemplary embodiments a hierarchical tree map is implemented to represent content space on a browser. Each terminal node in the tree map represents a content space cell while each internal node represents an aggregate of content space cells beneath it. The root node represents the entire product offering. On a browser if a user right clicks on a node a drop down menu is displayed. For terminal node each option in the drop down menu corresponds to an attribute associated to the content space cell represented by the node. For example the option of InfoCenter displays a link to the InfoCenter which is the value of the attribute InfoCenter . For internal nodes each option in the drop down menu corresponds to either to an attribute associated to the folded content space cell or an aggregate of all attributes of cells beneath it. For example the option of InfoCenter again displays a link to the InfoCenter albeit at a higher level. The option of Events displays all events related to the content space cells beneath the inner node.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein implement an internal interface for the software product s internal functional parts to access the content space at run time e.g. an internal callable set of interfaces that are used by product code . The following example interface methods show in Java style how various functions and uses of the embedded content space can be achieved 

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein further obtain and set attributes to each cell in the content space. The attributes are used for various purposes by the run time functions access content space. Some example attributes include but are not limited to 1 cell category 2 cell requirements 3 development owner 4 test owner 5 graphical user interface GUI panel ID 6 instances needed and the like.

During product development time people with different roles can attach attributes to each content space cell. Each attribute consists of a name and a value both are of a String type in Java programming language for example. illustrate an example of a table that illustrates the attributes that can be attached to each cell in accordance with exemplary embodiments. It will be appreciated that there are other attributes contemplated in other embodiments. The attributes shown in the table are just some of the content space cell attributes proposed to be shipped with a product for use at run time. The table represents a subset of attributes associated with content space cells.

In exemplary embodiments the following logical information is likely stored in memory rather than a file like the runtime content space data and might be located in the task or thread context data typically created at the external interface layers and passed down as calls are made. This data is filled in via multiple calls to the profile interfaces above one row per unique taskid threadid key 

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein further integrate a run time content space within a normal software product build process. The Content Space specification e.g. the specification files can be saved in JavaScript Object Notation JSON format in a plain text file. This file is copied into a jar e.g. a Java Archive file which is included in the final installation package. During installation process the jar file is installed to an appropriate location on the machine.

In exemplary embodiments the systems and methods described herein update the content space definition within the software product after the software is installed similar to updating other components of the software product . With each patch of the software product comes a potentially updated content space specification document. When a patch is installed the jar that contains the new content space specification document is copied to the correct location on the machine overriding the previous content space document. This process ensures the latest content space specification is available to all exploiters. In exemplary embodiments the profile information can be persevered in the old content space document and merged into the new document. The historical data collected during the life time of the old content space document will not be lost with this approach.

The content space embedding and other content space implementations described herein can be performed in any suitable computing system as now described. illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a system in which content space embedding can be implemented. The methods described herein can be implemented in software e.g. firmware hardware or a combination thereof. In exemplary embodiments the methods described herein are implemented in software as an executable program and is executed by a special or general purpose digital computer such as a personal computer workstation minicomputer or mainframe computer.

The content space embedding methods described herein may be in the form of a source program executable program object code script or any other entity comprising a set of instructions to be performed. When a source program then the program needs to be translated via a compiler assembler interpreter or the like which may or may not be included within the memory so as to operate properly in connection with the OS . Furthermore the content space embedding methods can be written as an object oriented programming language which has classes of data and methods or a procedure programming language which has routines subroutines and or functions.
