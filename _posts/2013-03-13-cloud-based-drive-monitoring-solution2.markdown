The present exemplary embodiments relate to remote monitoring. They find particular application in conjunction with industrial devices such as the POWERFLEX 7000 and will be described with particular reference thereto. However it is to be appreciated that the present exemplary embodiments are also amenable to other like applications.

Maintaining stability and integrity of industrial devices is a high priority. Industrial devices include for example motor drives such as the POWERFLEX 7000. Motor drives are used to generate and provide alternating current AC output power to a motor. Failure to maintain the stability and integrity of industrial devices can affect production and prove costly to entities employing the industrial devices. Further maintaining the stability and integrity of industrial devices can prove dangerous to those relying upon industrial equipment to for example generate power or pump gas to generate heat.

To maintain stability and integrity of industrial devices industrial devices can be locally or remotely monitored for anomalies and or patterns indicative of failure. Traditionally industrial devices have been locally monitored. However industrial equipment may not always be easily accessed. Further those with the technical know how to identify anomalies and or patterns indicative of failure may not be on site. Sending maintenance and or repair personnel to a field installation is costly. Remote monitoring provides a solution to these challenges.

Previous remote monitoring implementations involved customized software and infrastructure configurations which are cumbersome to maintain and update. Further on premise data collection required by such remote monitoring systems consumes large amounts of data storage. Moreover since potentially sensitive plant data is to be transmitted to a remote viewer secure data transmission channels are required.

The present application provides a new and improved system and method which overcome the above referenced problems and others.

In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure a cloud based remote monitoring system for monitoring an industrial facility is provided. The industrial facility includes one or more industrial devices. The system includes a cloud agent located at the industrial facility and configured to by at least one processor collect data indicative of a past and or a present state of the industrial devices according a manifest specific to the industrial facility. The cloud agent is further configured to send the collected data to a remote cloud platform according to the manifest dynamically reconfigure the cloud agent without interrupting the collecting and the sending. The cloud platform processes the sent data to facilitate remote monitoring of the industrial devices.

In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure a cloud based remote monitoring method for monitoring an industrial facility is provided. The industrial facility includes one or more industrial devices. By at least one processor located at the industrial facility data indicative of a past and or a present state of the industrial devices is collected according a manifest specific to the industrial facility. Further the collected data is sent to a remote cloud platform according to the manifest and the at least one processor is dynamically reconfigured without interrupting the collecting and the sending. The cloud platform processes the sent data to facilitate remote monitoring of the industrial devices.

In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure a cloud based remote monitoring system for monitoring an industrial facility is provided. The industrial facility includes one or more industrial devices. The system includes a cloud agent located at the industrial facility and configured to by at least one processor collect data indicative of a past and or a present state of the industrial devices according a manifest specific to the industrial facility. The cloud agent is further configured to send the collected data to a remote cloud platform according to the manifest.

The cloud agent is further configured to dynamically reconfigure the cloud agent without interrupting the collecting and the sending. The cloud platform processes the sent data from the queues to facilitate remote monitoring of the industrial devices data in each queue processed differently.

Various aspects of this disclosure are now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It should be understood however that certain aspects of this disclosure may be practiced without these specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate describing one or more aspects.

With reference to a cloud based remote monitoring system including one or more industrial facilities is provided. Each industrial facility corresponds to an industrial enterprise. For example a first industrial facility can correspond to a first industrial enterprise and a second industrial facility can correspond to a second industrial enterprise. As another example the first and second industrial facilities can correspond to a common industrial enterprise. The industrial facilities can be fixed e.g. a plant facility and or mobile e.g. a system contained in a truck or other service vehicle .

Each industrial facility includes one or more industrial devices . The industrial devices can include one or more of industrial controllers e.g. programmable logic controllers or other types of programmable automation controllers field devices e.g. sensors and meters motor drives e.g. the POWERFLEX 7000 operator interfaces e.g. human machine interfaces industrial monitors graphic terminals message displays etc. industrial robots barcode markers and readers vision system devices e.g. vision cameras smart welders and other such industrial devices.

Each of the industrial devices includes one or more memories. The memories include externally readable data external to the industrial device indicative of the present and or past state of the industrial device. For example the memories can include one or more of 1 one or more configurable parameters controlling the operation of the industrial device 2 one or more parameters indicating the status of the industrial device 3 one or more warning fault or alarm parameters indicating one or more of warnings faults and alarms respectively with the industrial device and 4 one or more queues each with one or more of warnings faults and alarms with the industrial device. Referring to an example memory layout of an industrial device is illustrated. Referring to an example table illustrating the bit layout of a status parameter of an industrial device is illustrated.

The industrial devices make up one or more automation systems operating within the respective facilities. Exemplary automation systems can include one or more of 1 batch control systems e.g. mixing systems 2 continuous control systems e.g. proportional integral derivative PID control systems and 3 discrete control systems. Exemplary automation systems can include one or more industrial controllers that facilitate monitoring and control of respective processes. The controllers exchange data with field devices using native hardwired input output I O and or using industrial facility networks e.g. Ethernet Internet Protocol IP Data Highway Plus ControlNet Devicenet etc. .

A given controller typically receives any combination of digital and analog signals from the field devices indicating a current state of the devices and their associated processes e.g. temperature position part presence or absence fluid level etc. and executes a user defined control program that performs automated decision making for the controlled processes based on the received signals. The controller then outputs appropriate digital and or analog control signaling to the field devices in accordance with the decisions made by the control program. These outputs can include device actuation signals temperature or position control signals operational commands to a machining or material handling robot mixer control signals motion control signals and the like. The control program can comprise any suitable type of code used to process input signals read into the controller and to control output signals generated by the controller including but not limited to ladder logic sequential function charts function block diagrams structured text or other such platforms.

Each industrial facility includes an on premise data collection system communicatively coupled to the respective industrial devices using one or more associated network connections and any suitable protocol. In some embodiments control interface protocol CIP and or distributed protocol interface DPI may be used for communication between the industrial devices and the data collection system . Using CIP and or DPI the data collection system is configurable to monitor controlled processes and device status through receipt of information related to the monitored devices and or associated processes.

The data collection system includes a cloud agent configured to collect live data e.g. status parameter values and or historical data e.g. alarm history fault history warning history status history trend data etc. from the industrial devices directly and or indirectly by for example accessing an optional data historian of the data collection system . The data historian monitors one or more industrial devices and stores data in local storage associated with the data historian. This data can include historical data and or live data read from the monitored devices. It s advantageous to use the data historian as the data source when there are a large number of data points to monitor.

The cloud agent is further configured to transmit the collected data to a cloud platform of the cloud based remote monitoring system . The data can be prioritized before transmission to the cloud platform . Further the data can be transmitted with priorities indicating the order with which the cloud platform processes the data. The cloud agent can further specify how transmitted data is to be processed for example to allow additional data types to be processed by the cloud platform . If an industrial device becomes disconnected powered off or otherwise unavailable an alarm is sent to the cloud platform . The cloud agent can be for example a Windows service that periodically collects and transmits serialized and compressed data into the cloud platform using standard web services over hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS secure sockets layer SSL .

The cloud agent is configured by a site specific manifest . The manifest can include a plurality of files and is typically in extensible markup language XML . The manifest can identify the frequencies with which data should be collected from the respective industrial devices . Typically the frequencies are specific to the industrial devices and or types of data e.g. alarms faults warnings status parameters configurable parameters historical data live data etc. . Even more the manifest can identify how the data transmitted to the cloud platform is processed by the cloud platform . Also the manifest can specify the priority with which data is processed by the cloud platform .

Further the manifest identifies which of the industrial devices to collect live data and or historical data for and what data to collect from the industrial devices . The data to collect is suitably specified for each industrial device or individual type of device by identifying one or more parameters in the memories of industrial devices and or by identifying alarms faults and or warnings to collect from the memories of industrial devices. For example the manifest can indicate the ready bit see is to be monitored for an industrial device. As another example the manifest can indicate the five most recent alarms in an alarm queue of an industrial device are to be collected. illustrates part of an example manifest listing POWERFLEX 7000 drives to monitor. illustrates part of an example manifest listing parameters to monitor for POWERFLEX 7000 drives.

Moreover the manifest can identify the priorities and or upload rates of the different types of data transmitted to the cloud platform . For instance historical data may be transmitted to the cloud platform for off site monitoring at a low priority and a low rate whereas other data can be transmitted at a higher priority and a higher rate. The manifest can also specify that certain data is characterized as live data which may be used by an off site monitoring facility for process monitoring or other monitoring purposes. In such a case the manifest may define such live data as being of high priority e.g. lower priority than alarm data but higher priority than historical data and may specify a corresponding high upload rate for such live data .

The cloud agent is dynamically configurable to allow changes to be made to the respective manifest during runtime. For example the number and type of monitored devices can be changed at any time. As another example the cloud agent allows the priority and upload rate settings for a given type of data to be dynamically set. This in turn allows a remote monitor to adjust the upload rate and or priority for a given device for example to facilitate troubleshooting from a remote location. Such adjustments moreover may be advantageous in process monitoring applications for instance in which a remote user desires higher granularity data with respect to a controlled process at the customer site and can employ dynamic adjustments to the rate and or priority settings of the manifest to adjust the speed of data monitoring.

Further the cloud agent can include multi threading capabilities to facilitate scalability and to prevent failed industrial devices from blocking data collection from other industrial devices. Upon detecting a failed industrial device the cloud agent can also generate an alarm to the cloud platform indicative of the failure.

In some embodiments the cloud agent includes a collection service and a queue processing service. The collection service stores the collected data e.g. to a working directory typically in a compressed state. A priority indicating the priority by which the cloud platform processes the data can also be added according to the manifest . The queue processing service then creates a data packet from the stored data and uploads the data packet to a temporary storage in the cloud platform . The order with which the data packet is uploaded relative to other data packets can be controlled by a priority of the data packet.

Further in some embodiments the cloud agent is configured by the manifest to for each industrial device read the list of parameters that have been configured for the device and upload data to the cloud platform . Further if there is a fault queue and or a warning queue the cloud agent for each industrial device reads the status to determine if there is a fault and or a warning. If there is a fault the most recent fault is read from the fault queue and uploaded to the cloud platform . Similarly if there is a warning the most recent warning is read from the warning queue and uploaded to the cloud platform .

The cloud platform can be any infrastructure that allows computing services to be accessed and utilized by cloud capable devices. For example the cloud platform can be MICROSOFT s AZURE cloud platform. The cloud platform can be a public cloud accessible via the Internet by devices having Internet connectivity and appropriate authorizations to utilize the services. In some scenarios the cloud platform can be provided by a cloud provider as a platform as a service PaaS and the services can reside and execute on the cloud platform as a cloud based service. In some such configurations access to the cloud platform and the services can be provided to customers as a subscription service by an owner of the services. For example the services can be provided using a software as a service SaaS service model. Alternatively the cloud platform can be a private cloud operated internally by an industrial enterprise. An exemplary private cloud can comprise a set of servers hosting the cloud services and residing on a corporate network protected by a firewall.

The cloud services can include one or more of data storage data analysis control applications e.g. applications that can generate and deliver control instructions to industrial devices based on analysis of real time system data or other factors visualization applications e.g. a cloud based operator interface system reporting applications enterprise resource planning ERP applications notification services and other such applications. In some embodiments the cloud services include a diagnostic service monitoring the health of respective automation systems or their associated industrial devices across an entire industrial facility or across multiple industrial facilities that make up an industrial enterprise. Further in some embodiments the cloud services include a control application used to track a unit of product through its stages of production and collect production data for each unit as it passes through each stage e.g. barcode identifier production statistics for each stage of production quality test data abnormal flags etc. . Even more in some embodiments the cloud services include an application monitoring for the unavailability of an industrial facility e.g. due to a power outage and generating an alert or notification e.g. an email notification in response to such an event.

The industrial devices suitably interact with the cloud services through the cloud agent . Advantageously this allows the industrial devices to be used with the cloud platform without modification. However direct interaction between the cloud services and at least some of the industrial devices is also contemplated. For example industrial devices having smart configuration capability can be configured to automatically detect and communicate with the cloud platform upon installation at any facility simplifying integration with existing cloud based data storage analysis or reporting applications used by the industrial enterprise.

Upon receiving data from the cloud agent the cloud platform processes the data using the cloud services . This can include adding the data in temporary storage for subsequent processing. The order with which the data packet is subsequently processed can be governed by a priority accompanying the data. The processing typically includes 1 analyzing the data and storing the results of the analysis in permanent storage and or 2 storing the data in permanent storage. The results and or the data can in turn be used to generate notifications e.g. email notifications of potential problems with industrial devices to users of the cloud platform reports and or visualizations. Reports visualizations and other service outputs are typically stored in permanent storage.

Once the cloud platform has processed received data the received data and or data derived from the received data are made available to one or more clients of the cloud platform for viewing. The clients can also be employed to remotely update the manifest of an industrial facility. For example a client can initiate selective adjustment to a manifest to change upload speeds priorities or add monitored devices. The clients can include web clients communicating with the cloud platform using for example hypertext transfer protocol HTTP or HTTPS. The clients can also include clients using specialized software to communicate with the cloud platform . Advantageously the clients allow remote monitoring of the industrial devices without being on site. Further problems can advantageously be more easily diagnosed by those with the requisite skill to do so.

In some embodiments the clients include a monitoring center. The monitoring center can be managed by an industrial enterprise to monitor its industrial facilities. Alternatively the monitoring center can be managed by a third party to monitor the industrial facilities of one or more industrial enterprises. In this case the third party can charge the industrial enterprises a fee for the monitoring.

Providing industrial devices with cloud capability can offer a number of advantages particular to industrial automation. The cloud platform can be easily scaled to accommodate differing amounts of data storage and processing. Further the cloud platform can be easily extended to increase functionality. For example the cloud platform can be extended to provide a motor control center MCC .

The cloud platform also provides a cost effective solution for industrial enterprises to monitor industrial devices. Industrial enterprises do not have to maintain a data center infrastructure or patch software running in the data center infrastructure. Further the cloud platform does away with high upfront costs and defers costs over a period of time when using a PaaS or SaaS service model. Even more monitoring and diagnosis are also improved since on site visits by those with requisite skill to identify future issues and or diagnosis issues are not required. Moreover multiple industrial facilities at different geographical locations can migrate their respective automation data to the cloud for aggregation collation collective analysis and enterprise level reporting without the need to establish a private network between the facilities.

With reference to a detailed embodiment of the cloud based remote monitoring system of is provided. This embodiment leverages the cloud platform to provide remote monitoring services to an industrial enterprise i.e. a customer using for example a SaaS service model.

As illustrated a plant facility includes an on premise data historian collecting live and or historical data from industrial devices e.g. data generated by one or more industrial controllers at the plant facility . For example the data historian monitors one or more parameters in parameters archives received from the industrial devices and stores data in local storage associated with the data historian e.g. a structured query language SQL server database . This can include both historical data e.g. alarm history warning history fault history status history trend data etc. as well as live data values read from the industrial devices.

An on premise cloud agent at the plant facility is configured to collect live and or historical data from the industrial devices either directly e.g. from one or more variable frequency drives or indirectly e.g. by accessing the data historian . The process of collecting the data involves intelligent sorting and organizing based on time of occurrence and 5 user defined priorities. The cloud agent can be for example a Windows service that periodically collects and transmits serialized and compressed data to the cloud platform using standard web services over HTTPS SSL. As illustrated the data historian is a data source for the cloud agent . The use of a data historian is advantageous when there are a large number of data points to monitor. However cloud agent can additionally or alternatively collect data directly from the industrial devices e.g. through a CIP link as illustrated with respect to the variable frequency drives or through middleware applications e.g. open productivity and connectivity OPC clients .

With reference to a more detailed illustration of the cloud agent is provided. The cloud agent includes a collection service that collects data directly from the industrial devices e.g. the variable frequency drives and or indirectly from the industrial devices e.g. by way of the data historian via a CIP link or other suitable communication protocol. The collection service is controlled by a site specific manifest which can specify one or more of what data to be collected how often to collect the data how to retrieve data from the industrial devices and so on. For example the manifest can specify that the following should be collected for a specific type of motor drive motor speed motor power motor voltage motor current drive status last warning and last fault. The collection service stores the collected data in a data file typically a compressed data file. In addition reference to the stored data file is added to a queue e.g. a MICROSOFT Message Queue Server MSMQ database . The queue can be prioritized based on priorities specified in the manifest. These priorities can be specific to different parameters different types of data different industrial devices different types of industrial devices etc.

A queue processing service of the cloud agent reads the data file in the order it appears in the queue . Based on the manifest the queue processing service packages the data file into a data packet and pushes the data packet to the cloud platform . The data packet includes a header which can include customer specific data read from the manifest. This customer specific data can include for example a behavioral assembly ID and or priority for processing the data of the data packet. As discussed hereafter behavior assemblies implement customer site capabilities to process monitored data and are typically specific to different types of data. Alternatively instead of including the customer specific data wholly within the header this customer specific data can at least partially be included in an event data notification which is generated and pushed to the cloud platform concurrently with the data packet and in accordance with the manifest. The queue processing service can also encrypt and send storage account keys to the cloud platform for user verification.

An exemplary data packet is illustrated in . In addition to a data file the data packet includes a header which includes one or more of a unique customer identifier ID a site ID representing a particular industrial facility a virtual support engineer ID a data priority for the data in the data file a message type and a process ID. Packaging the data in this way allows data from diverse data sources to be packaged together using a uniform generic data packaging schema so that the data can be moved to the cloud infrastructure.

The manifest can include one or more of subscription information for the cloud platform how to push data to the cloud platform firewall settings that allow the cloud agent to communicate with the cloud platform and so on. The manifest may can also include associations between data and behavioral assemblies thus allowing easy scaling to add more customized associations and dynamic reconfiguration of associations for cloud side parsing of received data packets.

A configuration interface of the cloud agent allows modifications to be made to the manifest of the cloud agent . For example users can assign priorities to respective data parameters or parameter groups at the customer site. Accordingly when the queue processing service packages the collected data to be moved to the cloud platform the collected data items can be packaged into data packets according to priority as defined in the manifest and the respective data packet headers or respective event data notification packets can be populated with the appropriate priority level.

Advantageously if access to the cloud platform is disconnected data will continue to be collected by the collection service and stored locally at local storage associated with the collections service . When communication to the cloud platform is restored the stored data is forwarded to the cloud platform . Hence data is not lost due to a lapse in connectivity with the cloud platform .

Returning back to upon receiving a data packet data in the received data packet is intelligently stored in temporary storage e.g. in cloud blob storage . The infrastructure can use cloud agent reasoning and collective bargaining to determine a data storage locale. Further based on the corresponding customer specific data a record linking to the stored data is created in a selected one of one or more message queues of the cloud platform. The record suitably includes at least some of the customer specific data and the selected queue can be prioritized using a priority of the customer specific data. The customer specific data can be received as part of the data packet a corresponding event data notification or a combination of the two. Further the customer specific data can include or be accompanied by a selection of the one of the message queues . The message queues define how the data is processed in the cloud platform . In the present example separate queues have been defined for alarms live data historical data and motor drive data .

The historical data queue relates to time series records accessed through for example an SQL application programming interface API . The live data queue relates to substantially real time monitored data such as current temperatures current pressures etc. The live data values can also be accessed through SQL API. The motor drives queue is specific to motor drive data accessed through a DPI protocol to the respective drives. The motor drive data can relate to alarming and uploading of drive parameter data via a connector that uses the DPI protocol via for example a .NET class provided by the drives group.

The alarms queue relates to abnormal situations where the alarm data can also be accessed through SQL API. This alarms queue can comprise multiple queues associated with different priorities to allow for different alarms having different levels of criticality. In some embodiments servers controllers switches etc. can be monitored using a number of protocols and at a certain point e.g. at the end of a monitoring cycle alarms are queued up and the cloud agent sends the alarms to the cloud platform . Alarms can be reactive e.g. alarm when a motor fails when a central processing unit CPU crashes when an interlock is tripped etc. or proactive e.g. track consumables on a machine and alarm when time to reorder monitor cycle counts on a machine and determine when to schedule preventative maintenance alarm when temperatures go out of defined bandwidths send notification when a computer s memory is 80 full etc. .

Through a configuration interface provided by the cloud agent users at the plant facility can dynamically configure these message queues . Namely the cloud agent allows the user to define these queues from the on site location and to define how data in each queue is handled. For example the user can define for each queue an upload frequency to the queue a priority level e.g. which data queues should take processing priority over other data queues which cloud partitions or databases data from the respective queues should be placed in and other such information. The configuration of the message queues is suitably stored in the manifest and provided to the cloud platform for example upon initialization.

In an exemplary scenario the live data queue may be defined to process live data values that are to be used by a remote operator interface application to view substantially real time data from the plant facility while the historical data queue may be used to process historical data for archival storage in a historical database in cloud storage . Accordingly the live data queue may be assigned a higher priority relative to the historical data queue since data in the live data queue is more time critical than data in the historical queue .

On the output of the message queues a worker role processes data referenced in the respective queues according to predefined processing definitions and according to the priorities of the data. The worker role determines how data is to be processed and stored based on a manifest typically a client specific manifest stored in the cloud storage . The manifest references behavior assemblies e.g. a dynamic link library DLL stored in the cloud storage . The behavior assemblies implement customer site capabilities to process monitored data. The behavior assemblies can be dynamically uploaded by a user at the plant facility through the cloud agent which facilitates dynamic extension of the cloud platform . Additional roles can be dynamically added as needed.

For example if new data points are to be added to the cloud based remote monitoring system that require creation of a new message queue the user can interact with the cloud agent to configure a new behavior assembly for the new queue that defines such aspects as a processing priority for the data an upload frequency for the data where the data is to be stored within cloud storage and other such information. The cloud agent can then upload the new behavior assembly together with the data or independently of the data . The new behavior assembly is then added to the customer s manifest with the other behavior assemblies defined for the customer so that the worker role can leverage the new behavior assembly to determine how data in the new queue is to be processed. This new behavior assembly need only be uploaded to the cloud platform once.

Thereafter data placed in the new message queue of the message queues will be processed by the worker role according to the new behavior assembly stored in the customer s manifest . For example the manifest may define where the data is to be stored within the cloud storage e.g. in the historical database or in an alarms and live data database and whether processing of the new data queue is to take priority over other data queues. In some embodiments the manifest may only accept a new behavior assembly if the behavior assembly is accompanied by a unique key associated with the client.

Once the cloud platform has processed and stored the data provided by the cloud agent according to the techniques described above the data can be made accessible to one or more clients for viewing. For example data analysis on the cloud platform can provide a set of web based and browser enabled technologies for retrieving directing and uncompressing the data from the cloud platform to web clients. To this end reporting services can deliver data in the cloud storage e.g. from the alarm and live data database or the historical database to the clients in a defined format. For example the reporting services can leverage monitored data stored in the cloud storage to provide remote operator interfaces to the clients over the Internet.

Using the cloud agent described above users can organize the cloud computing infrastructure at the plant facility through the cloud agent without the need to redevelop recompile test and re upload services. The cloud agent provides a mechanism to integrate industrial devices with the cloud platform where data from the industrial devices can be leveraged by the cloud services . By offering users the ability to create and upload behavior assemblies for respective data types the cloud agent can facilitate dynamic allocation of cloud computing data storage and computing resources for plant data.

As used herein the terms to infer and inference refer generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system environment and or user from a set of observations as captured via events and or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action or can generate a probability distribution over states for example. The inference can be probabilistic that is the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher level events from a set of events and or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.
