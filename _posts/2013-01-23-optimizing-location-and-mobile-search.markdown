This patent application is a continuation in part of International Patent Application No. PCT US2013 022606 filed on Jan. 22 2013 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 588 642 filed Jan. 19 2012 and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 655 957 filed on Jun. 5 2012 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Search engine optimization SEO generally describes the use of computing systems for running computing processes that collect store and analyze search engine data in order to provide recommendations to improve visibility of a website or a webpage in search engines. Search engine results may be obtained by various search strategies such as natural un paid organic or algorithmic search results as well as for paid search algorithms of search engine marketing SEM target paid listings. Generally the higher a website is located on a website listing and the more frequently a website appears in the search results list the more visitors it may receive from the search engine s users. An entity may target different kinds of search results besides strictly website results for SEO. For example universal results such as images location videos news and other industry specific vertical search results may be optimized for search engines. SEO may improve the availability for to internet users to access a website or other digital content.

With the increase in mobile technology more and more internet users are accessing the internet through mobile devices such as smart phones tablets and other mobile devices. Search engines and other providers of content on the internet are adapting to the increase in searches performed on mobile devices in various ways to optimize the user experience for users performing searches on mobile devices. In addition a recent increase in search activity while end users are moving from place to place with their mobile devices has been associated with a marked transition by search engines who increasingly display search results filtered and organized by the location of the end user of a search resulting in search results being organized and displayed differently by device type non mobile devices vs. mobile device as well as differently by the location of the device.

The explosion in the combinations of types of devices the increasing sophistication of search engines that return search results intended for display on certain classes of devices the targeting of content for delivery in an arbitrary number of specific locations cities towns and other regions and areas as such entities may be variously defined makes it increasingly difficult for digital marketers to identify track monitor and compare differences in search performance by device and by location putting a premium on highly scalable solutions that are increasingly integrated and highly automated.

The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather this background is only provided to illustrate one exemplary technology area where some embodiments described herein may be practiced.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential characteristics of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A method of analyzing reporting on and optimizing digital content for searches performed on mobile devices. The method may include receiving digital content that includes one or more pages intended for display on various classes of devices receiving search results for one or more of the various classes of devices and analyzing the digital content to determine one or more properties of the digital content that relate to placement of a reference to the digital content in the search results for the one or more of the various classes of devices. The method may also include analyzing the properties of the digital content to determine one or more optimizations to apply to the digital content to improve the placement of the reference to the digital content in the search results for the one or more of the various classes of devices and generating one or more recommendations for adapting the digital content based on the optimizations across the one or more of the various classes of devices.

A method of optimizing a website for searches performed using a search engine that are based on physical locations where the searches are requested by managing location data for the website. The method may include accessing location data in a location database the location data being associated with and available on a website of a business and the location data including information about at least one physical location of the business and receiving search results for one or more locations. The method may also include analyzing the location data to determine one or more properties of the location data that relates to placement of a reference to the website in the search results for the one or more locations and analyzing the properties of the location data to determine one or more optimizations to apply to the location data to improve the placement of the reference to the website in the search results for the one or more locations. The method may also include generating one or more recommendations for adapting the location data based on the optimizations.

A method of search engine optimization based on a location may include performing a first search on a network with a search engine using a first keyword to obtain first search results. The first search may be based on a first location. The method may further include identifying a first position for a reference to digital content within the first search results and performing a second search on the network with the search engine using a second keyword to obtain second search results. The second search may be based on a second location. The method may further include identifying a second position for the reference to the digital content within the second search results and generating a recommendation based on the first position and the second position to adapt the digital content to improve the position of the reference to the digital content within either or both the first and second search results.

These and other aspects of example embodiments of the invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof. In the drawings similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description drawings and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure as generally described herein and illustrated in the figures may be arranged substituted combined separated and designed in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.

With the increase in mobile technology more and more users are using mobile technology to interact with networks such as the World Wide Web Web through one or more portals such as the internet. These mobile technologies include cellular phones such as smart phones gaming consoles global positioning system devices tablet computers portable music devices and other types of mobile devices.

More particularly searches are being performed on mobile devices rather than on non mobile devices such as traditional personal computers PCs . Current mobile devices may offer increasingly sophisticated browsers run on high speed network offer compelling graphics capabilities easier more intuitive user interfaces and or nearly continuous connectivity to global networks such as the internet among other things enables end users to do things on their mobile devices that previously had been the domain of non mobile devices and often on a more timely and or frequent basis as end user move from location to location. Recent data from some websites suggest visits to websites by mobile devices represent well over 30 of the website s web traffic. This is transforming the search experience for end users. With current mobile devices a user may search for a restaurant hotel or store while moving about their day without ever accessing a non mobile device. While mobile devices perform basic search functions similar to those performed by non mobile devices the search experience is different for users using mobile devices and search engines are responding to these changes. For example in some embodiments search engines e.g. Google Bing Yandex Baidu may modify search results they deliver to end users taking into account the types of mobile devices that end users are searching on type and quality of digital content suitable for display on such mobile devices end user location when requesting a search physical locations associated with the digital content being searched for and other services end users receive from mobile devices. In these and other embodiments the search engines may modify the search results based on the above factors to present results of digital content that includes information about a physical business relevant to the search and to a specific location of the end user such as a physical address phone number driving directions hours of operation etc. for the physical business. Alternately or additionally the search results may be arranged in a way to be suitable for display on different types of devices including mobile devices or in specially designed location or mobile packs that appear in the search results. An example of this may be a search result that includes the physical location of a store for a consumer retail product or services company e.g. hardware store department store coffee shop fast food restaurant etc. .

The number of content developers for these networks are increasing and accordingly search engines advertisers marketers and others are adapting to mobile devices. One difficulty with the increase in mobile technology however is that it is difficult for digital marketers of goods and services to cater their goods and services to the mobile search environment. Entities desire their digital content to rank perform well in searches performed on mobile device because it may drive a significant share of their business performance and influence how end users think about their products services and brands. Ranking performing well in searches performed on mobile devices is difficult however with the proliferation of different mobile devices and search engines changing how they respond to searches from diverse types of mobile devices. As such entities wanting to optimize their digital content for mobile searches may consider how their digital content may be treated by search engines when searches are performed on mobile devices. Different aspects of digital content may affect how search engines treat the digital content. Some aspects of digital content that may affect how search engines treat the digital content may be sizes of pages within the digital content a compression ratio of pages within the digital content a cache control setting for the server hosting the digital content a keyword type location information made available by the digital content such as by way of example and not limitation the street address phone number link to a map or driving directions all or some of which may be specially configured for different types of mobile devices a mobile device flag within the digital content a mobile device sub domain within the digital content mobile device specific content within the digital content among others. Search engines furthermore are increasingly customizing how location specific search results are presented on mobile devices which may directly affect how effectively marketers can organize their content to maximize their search results for searches performed on a location by location basis.

The location information made available by the digital content and presented to the search engines may also be detected and adjusted so that the right type of location information or information about a physical location e.g. the phone number address physical store hours is being provided to a search engine and that the information is correct. The information may be detected and adjusted within a search engine optimization SEO system a content management system CMS or some other system such as a database or data storage system.

A search engine may also be using locations to further refine search results for non mobile devices as well as mobile devices. Search results may vary widely based on the location where the search is performed. For example search results in one location for a keyword may produce search results with different category specific digital content such as images videos news shopping realtime blogs books places discussions recipes patents calculator stock timelines and other digital content that is closely related and directed toward a certain type of digital content so as to be in a category of digital content. For example in response to a search for burgers from a first location the search results may have images of burgers and locations of various local burger restaurants. In another search for burgers at a second location the search results may not include images of burgers and may include more or less locations for various local burger restaurants. In another example references to the same burger restaurant may have different positions in the search results based on the location where the search is performed. Alternately or additionally adding or omitting a location in the keyword used for the search may change the search results even when the location of where the search is being performed is considered by the search engine.

Generally embodiments disclosed herein relate to computing systems and processes used in methods for optimizing digital content for mobile search. Optimizing digital content for mobile search includes understanding user behaviors when searching on mobile devices and how network contents providers such as application creators and search engines among others provide search results to mobile devices and how to adjust digital content based on user search engine and network content provider behavior to enhance the ability of entities to increase visibility of their websites webpages or other digital content in searches performed on mobile devices. In some embodiments the optimizations that may be applied to digital content may be prioritized based on one or more factors such as an estimated change in position in search results when affecting an optimization an increase in conversions or traffic at the digital content when affecting an optimization an increase in revenue generated by the digital content when affecting an optimization among others. In addition additional factors for prioritizing optimizations may be determined by a web analytics system using the digital content. It should be understood that an entity may be a corporation company partnership firm organization foundation individual trust family or otherwise that has digital content on the Internet.

Reference will now be made to the figures wherein like structures will be provided with like reference designations. It is understood that the figures are diagrammatic and schematic representations of some embodiments of the invention and are not limiting of the present invention nor are they necessarily drawn to scale.

The network may include the Internet including a global internetwork formed by logical and physical connections between multiple wide area networks and or local area networks and may optionally include the World Wide Web Web including a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. Alternately or additionally the network includes one or more cellular RF networks and or one or more wired and or wireless networks such as but not limited to 802.xx networks Bluetooth access points wireless access points IP based networks or the like. The network may also include servers that enable one type of network to interface with another type of network.

The web server may include any system capable of storing and transmitting digital content such as webpages and other digital content. The web server may provide access to the webpages of a website or other digital content on the web that may be analyzed for improving mobile or local search. For example the web server may include a computer program that is responsible for accepting requests from clients such as web browsers and serving them HTTP responses along with optional data contents which may include HTML documents and linked objects for display to the user. Additionally or alternately the web server may include the capability of logging some detailed information about client requests and server response to log files.

Digital content as used herein refers to any online posting including domains subdomains web posts Uniform Resource Identifiers URIs Uniform Resource Locators URLs images videos or other piece of content and non permanent postings such as e mail and chat unless otherwise specified.

The search engine may be an internal or private search engine that is used for the function of producing search results. The search results produced by the search engine may vary based on the requesting device or type of requesting device. For example the search engine may provide a first set of search results when a search is requested for a keyword by a standard PC non mobile device and a second set of search results when the search is requested for the keyword by a mobile device such as the mobile device . The use of the word keyword herein relates to one or more words or characters that may be entered into a search engine to produce search results. As such a keyword may be a single word such as shoe or a keyword may be a string of words such as cheap red Nike basketball shoes. As another example the search engine may provide a first set of search results when a search is requested for a keyword in a first location and a second set of search results when the search is requested for the keyword from a second location.

In some embodiments the search engine may not discriminate between devices of the same type. For example for the same search query a search engine may provide first results to a laptop and a desktop while providing second results to different types of mobile devices. In some embodiments the search engine may further discriminate between different types of mobile devices or non mobile devices. For example the search engine may generate results for tablets that differ from results generated for smart phones. In some embodiments the difference between the search results generated for different requesting devices may be the presentation of the referenced digital content while the referenced digital content may be the same. Alternately or additionally the digital content referenced in the search results may be different. In some embodiments the search engine may also change the search results based on the location of a device and whether the device is a mobile device or a non mobile device.

The search engine may generate different search results for different devices when the search engine is able to determine a difference between requests received at the search engine . For example a search request may indicate that the request originated at a mobile device or a non mobile device such as a PC and the search engine may generate results appropriate for each device. In some embodiments a search request may not distinguish a requesting device. In these and other embodiments the search engine may send similar results to different types of devices.

In some embodiments the search engine may generate different requests for different devices based on the devices being different but also based on different information that is received from each device. For example a mobile device such as the mobile device may have a global positioning system GPS device or other device that tracks the location of the mobile device to a low level of granularity. The mobile device may send its location to the search engine in the search request and the search engine may generate search results based on the location of the mobile device . By including the location of the mobile device as a factor when generating the search results the search engine may generate search results that differ from search results that do not include the location that do not include the granularity of location information or that include the location information in a different form such as a keyword location or the location information pulled from the mobile device and not input by a user as a keyword. Alternately or additionally the search engine may generate search results based on a location that differ from search results that do not include the location that do not include the granularity of the location information or include the location information in a different form in non mobile devices.

The search engine may be a public search engine or a commercial search engine such as Bing Google Yahoo Yandex Baidu or the like.

In some embodiments the deep index engine may be configured to generate search requests using different keywords and send the search requests to the search engine . The deep index engine may also receive the search results from the search engine and crawl the search results to determine information about the search results. For example the deep index engine may be configured to crawl search results and analyze data associated with the crawl including on page information and back link data e.g. back link URL anchor text etc. for each digital content referenced in the search result.

In some embodiments the deep index engine may be configured to emulate different devices to cause the search engine to generate results for a specific device. For example the deep index engine may emulate a mobile device and a non mobile device and crawl search results returned by the search engine for both devices. For example the deep index engine may emulate a mobile device and in some embodiments the deep index engine may be configured to emulate devices located in different locations. In these and other embodiments the deep index engine may be able to determine differences between search results that occur in different locations.

The deep index engine may be further configured to determine placement of digital content in search results generated by a search engine. It is to be understood that when digital content is referenced as being in search results the digital content itself may be in the search results for example an image may be in the search result. Alternately digital content being in search results may be understood as meaning that a reference to the digital content and or a portion of the digital content is in the search results. For example the search results may include a reference to a website and a portion of the website for previewing on the search results but not include the entire website on the search results.

The placement of the digital content in search results may be referred to as a ranking of the digital content in the search results a page position of the digital content in the search result or a pixel position of the digital content in the search results. The placement of the digital content may account for a position at which a particular search result is displayed within the search results for a search term or search term combination. The relative position of digital content within the search result may affect how the search term or search term combination affects actions of a search engine relative to search results. For example digital content such as a webpage may be displayed in different locations on a search results page based on whether the search was requested from a non mobile device or a mobile device. Alternately or additionally digital content such as a webpage may be displayed in different locations on a search results page based on whether the search requested included location information about the device making the request.

The placement of digital content in search results may be dependent on numerous properties of the digital content. Some properties of the digital content that may affect the placement of the digital content in search results may include a size of one or more of the pages of the digital content a compression ratio of one or more of the pages of the digital content a cache control setting for the server hosting the digital content a keyword type location information availability a mobile device flag a mobile device sub domain mobile device specific content among others.

A deep index engine according to some embodiments is described in more detail in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 458 978 entitled COLLECTING AND SCORING ONLINE REFERENCES filed Apr. 27 2012 which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The functionalities described herein may be applied to optimizing webpages for a website.

The correlator may be configured to determine how visitors are directed to digital content and how those visitors behave once they arrive at the digital content. For example the correlator may be configured to determine click through rates based on the number of visitors that arrive at the digital content from a search results page generated from searching for a keyword and the number of searches that occur using a keyword based on information received from a search engine that generates the search results page. The correlator may be further configured to determine a number of conversions that occur by visitors at the digital content based on their behavior. In some embodiments a conversion may be an action of the visitor such as downloading a whitepaper article application file or other digital object viewing a page making a purchase through the digital content associating the digital content with a social networking approving of the digital content in a social network placing a link to the digital content in a social network mentioning the digital content in some social media among others. Alternately or additionally the correlator may be configured to determine a value associated with an increase in the number of visitors at digital content or an increase in the number of conversions for the digital content.

A correlator according to some embodiments is described in more detail in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 574 069 filed Oct. 6 2009 entitled CORRELATING WEB PAGE VISITS AND CONVERSIONS WITH EXTERNAL REFERENCES which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The mobile search module may be configured to audit digital content to determine optimizations that may be performed on the digital content to increase a placement of the digital content on search results generated for a mobile device. In particular the mobile search module may be configured to receive digital content and analyze the digital content to determine one or more properties of the digital content that relate to placement of a reference to the digital content in mobile search results. After determine the properties of the digital content the mobile search module may be configured to analyze the properties of the digital content to determine one or more optimizations to apply to one or more of the properties of the digital content to improve the placement of the reference to the digital content in the mobile search results. The mobile search module may be further configured to generate a report that includes the optimizations. In some embodiments the audit performed by the mobile search module may be referred to as a Mobile Site Audit of digital content.

In some embodiments the mobile search module may further be configured to provide optimization for device specific features such as mobile application stores or mobile app stores. As may be understood by one of skill in the art mobile app stores include listings of applications that are specifically designed for mobile devices. Typically these mobile app stores include search features that operate in a similar manner as a search engine although the searches are limited to mobile applications. In order to optimize their performance in a mobile app store an entity may need to modify their marketing strategies. For example specific descriptions or tags may be more useful or effective in resulting in sales or downloads of a mobile app. For example the mobile search module may determine that a particular entity s mobile app comprising a chess game is underperforming in sales as compared to other mobile app chess games which offer a free or demo version of the game. Alternatively the mobile search module may determine that chess games with shorter tags are more successful than the entity s game. In other instances the mobile search module may determine that mobile apps with a larger number of user reviews result in greater sales. Hence the mobile search module may recommend to the entity a marketing program wherein end users are offered an incentive such as some form of free content if they review the game. For example in the chess game the entity may offer bonus content such as specially designed pieces or game boards for users that have reviewed the game.

Other information which may be collected and analyzed by the mobile search module in the mobile app setting include the number of users of a particular mobile app the type or number of links from the app to websites or applications outside the app or the app store the description of the product how the app is listed in the app store versus it s search engine ranking as performed on a non mobile.

The location module may be configured to determine differences in placement in search results for digital content when the searches are conducted based on different location parameters. The location module may communicate with the search engine to perform the searches based on different location parameters. In some embodiments the location parameters may be sent to the search engine from the requesting device. In other embodiments the search engine may have previously retrieved the location parameters from the digital content when the search engine crawled the digital content. Alternately or additionally the search engine may retrieve the location information from another database. The search engine may place a reference to the digital content or the digital content in a search results based on the location information. Based on differences in placement for the same digital content in search results with different location parameters the location module may be configured to provide recommendations for optimizing the digital content to improve the placement of the digital content in the search results.

The location data manager may be configured to manage location data for digital content. The location data may include information about at least one physical location of a business related to the digital content. For example a website for a restaurant may include location data that may include information about the physical locations of the restaurant. The location data may include various fields and may be managed by a content management system that generates the website or by a third party website. The location data manager may be configured to access and check the location data for accuracy correct formatting and correct data fields and to update the location data.

The digital content may be any digital content that is available over a network such as the internet. In some embodiments the digital content may be a website with multiple pages and sub domains. In some embodiments the digital content may be a blog a video an image or some other type of digital content that may be stored on a network or available through secured channels or public channels of the internet.

In some embodiments the first database may be part of a system that includes the digital content auditor . In these and other embodiments the digital content may be sent to the digital content auditor over a network or sent directly to the digital content auditor . In some embodiments the first database may be remote from the digital content auditor . In these and other embodiments the digital content may be sent to the digital content auditor during a secured or non secured file transfer. For example the digital content may be a webpage and the digital content auditor may receive both the public and non public portions of the digital content through a file transfer. In some embodiments digital content auditor may access the digital content in the first database through navigating to the digital content through the internet and accessing the publically available portions of the digital content . For example the digital content may be a webpage and the digital content auditor may receive the digital content in the same manner as any user of the internet may access the digital content .

The property module may be configured to receive the digital content from the first database . The property module may be further configured to analyze the digital content to determine properties of the digital content that relate to placement of a reference to the digital content in search results generated for a mobile device. Various properties that may relate to placement of a reference to the digital content in search results generated for a mobile device may include one or more of the following a size of one or more pages of the digital content a compression ratio of one or more pages of the digital content a cache control setting for the server hosting the digital content a keyword type within the digital content location information availability a mobile device flag a mobile device sub domain and mobile device specific content. The various properties may be determined by analyzing the digital content. For example the html code or other code and other aspects of a website may be analyzed to determine the properties of the website.

The size of one or more pages of the digital content the compression ratio of one or more pages of the digital content and the cache control setting for the server hosting the digital content may relate to the load times for the digital content . The amount of time for a device to load the digital content may relate to how a search engine places the digital content or a reference to the digital content on a search results page. For example mobile devices and their communication speeds are typically longer than communication speeds with non mobile devices and as such websites or applications that are more difficult to load on mobile devices may under perform.

The keyword type property may include information about the keywords contained within the digital content that may be used by a search engine to associate the digital content with a search being performed by the search engine. For example a search may be performed for the keyword shoes. When the digital content includes a reference to shoes and the search engine is aware that the digital content includes the reference to shoes the search engine may display the digital content or a reference to the digital content in a search results that it generates. Other factors beside the digital content listing the keyword may be considered by the search engine in determining whether to include the digital content or a reference thereto on the search results that the search engine generates.

The keyword type property may include various keyword properties. The property module may analyze the digital content to determine if the keywords in the digital content include the keyword type properties. In some embodiments the digital content including a keyword type property may be the digital content having a particular keyword within the digital content . For example the keyword properties may include the lengths of keywords and keywords associated with an auto complete feature used by a mobile device. In these and other embodiments the digital content may have these keyword properties by having the keywords of proper length and having keywords that are associated with an auto complete feature used by a mobile device. In some embodiments the digital content including a keyword type property may be the keywords in the digital content that are associated with other aspects of the digital content such as location information in the digital content .

Keyword length may be meaningful because mobile users using the keyboards provided by most mobile devices may be less inclined to enter long or highly detailed keywords since the keyboards are more difficult to use than keyboards typically attached to most non mobile devices. Thus for digital content to be presented in mobile search results keywords lengths in the digital content may need to correspond with length of keywords entered on a mobile device.

Keywords associated with an auto complete feature used by a mobile device may also be meaningful because mobile devices may prompt user to complete phrases because of the increased difficulty in entering words into mobile devices. An auto complete feature may also include a predictive word search feature and a predictive phrase search feature. For example although a user would typically enter an entire keyword search of women s heels using a non mobile device the same user may see the phrase women s shoes appear as a predictive search after entering women s and may elect to have the predictive search performed rather than taking the effort to enter the second term.

The property module may analyze the digital content to determine if word patterns that result from use of auto complete predictive search predictive phrase suggestions that are typically installed and operating on mobile devices are in the digital content .

The property module may determine if the digital content includes the location information availability property. The digital content may include the ability to provide a search engine with locations that are associated with the digital content . When a search engine crawls or otherwise determines information about the digital content the digital content may provide location data to the search engine so that the search engine associates the digital content with that location. As a result when a search is conducted that includes a location parameter the search engine may generate search results that include the digital content . For example the digital content may be a website for a burger place in Oakland Calif. For a search conducted for burger Oakland the website may not be identified by the search engine if the digital content had not indicated to the search engine that the digital content was associated with Oakland.

The property module may determine if the digital content includes the mobile device flag property. A mobile device flag may be included in digital content to indicate when the digital content is being requested by a mobile device. For example the mobile device flag may be a process that analyzes a request for digital content from a device to determine when the request is from a mobile device. When the mobile device flag determines that the request is from a mobile device the mobile device flag may indicate certain portions of the digital content be provide to the mobile device or direct the request to certain portions of the digital content. For example when digital content is a website the website may have a sub domain with webpages designed for mobile devices e.g. m.dot . or specific content designed for mobile devices that is applied using cascading style sheets. When the website detects a mobile device is requesting the website the website may direct the mobile device to the mobile sub domain or apply cascading style sheets for mobile devices to the content being sent to the mobile device.

The property module may indicate to the optimization module what properties the digital content includes. The optimization module may be configured to determine optimizations that may be applied to the digital content based on the properties of the digital content . In some embodiments the optimization module may determine the optimizations that may be applied to the digital content based on the properties that the digital content is lacking.

For example the digital content may lack a mobile device flag. The optimization module may determine that an optimization for the digital content may be to add a mobile device flag.

In some embodiments the optimization module may also review the keywords types present in the digital content . In these and other embodiments the optimization module may retrieve database keywords from the second database and compare the keywords in the digital content with the database keywords . When the optimization module determines that the digital content lacks a keyword from the database keywords an optimization for the digital content may be to include the keyword that is lacking. The database keywords used by the optimization module may vary based on the type of digital content being optimized. For example based on locations associated with the digital content the keywords may be different.

In some embodiments the optimization module may be further configured to optimize portions of the digital content based on the properties detected by the property module . For example the optimization module may determine that the database keywords be added to the portions of the digital content that are configured to be sent to mobile devices and not on other portions of the digital content . The database keywords may be managed by a keyword manager. A keyword manager is described further with respect to .

Furthermore the outlined steps and operations are only provided as examples and some of the steps and operations may be optional combined into fewer steps and operations or expanded into additional steps and operations without detracting from the essence of the disclosed embodiments.

For example when the property of the digital content includes a keyword type the method may further include generating a keyword location map that rates search performances of keywords based on search locations where one of the optimizations to apply to the digital content includes the inclusion of a keyword from the keyword location. In these and other embodiments the search performance of the keywords may be based on the search volume of the keywords.

In some embodiments when the property of the digital content includes location information and when analyzing the location information when the digital content includes location information the method may further include determining when the location information includes one or more of the following fields an address field a business hours field a map field a directions field a phone number field a customer review field among other fields.

In some embodiments when the property of the digital content includes location information and when analyzing the location information when the digital content includes location information the method may further include searching second digital content separate from the digital content for the location information where the second digital content is operated by a third party. For example the second digital content may be a database and may be operated by Yelp Four square CitySearch Google places Google Local or some other third party that collects and stores information and physical locations of business with digital content. In these and other embodiments the method may further include analyzing the location information at the second digital content for format and accuracy. In some embodiments one of the one or more optimizations to apply to the digital content may include updating location information.

In some embodiments the method may be performed by a first system. In these and other embodiments the method may further include automatically and directly inputting the recommendation from within the first system into a second system through a direct interface or an application specific interface. In these and other embodiments the second system may be a database or a content management system and the first system may be a search engine optimization platform.

An example of optimizing digital content for searches performed on a mobile device is as follows. An entity such as a company that manufactures shoes may have a company website on the Internet. The entity may also have images of shoes and other digital content that displays their shoes such as specific pairs of shoes and their corresponding price that are available over the internet and searchable by search engines. A website may be received and analyzed to determine the properties of the website. It may be determined that the website has a listing of keywords a mobile device flag that directs users from mobile devices to a mobile device domain with content optimized for the mobile device and a page size and compression ratio of the pages. The properties are then analyzed. For example if it is determined that the amount of pages or the size of the pages is so vast that there was a delay in the amount of time it took for a mobile user to download or display the pages as compared to websites of the entity s competitors an optimization may be to reformat pages to be more compatible with a mobile device. In other instances the analysis may indicate that location specific keywords shorter keywords or keywords which are aligned with predictive keyword searches produced on mobile devices that are not part of the website be included on the website.

The managing module may be configured to manage keywords for use in optimizing digital content for searches performed on mobile devices and or for other functions. The managing module may include submodules for implementing particular functionalities. The managing module may be generic to and include an analytic module determination module and a reporting module .

The search result computing system may include a search results database that may store one or more search results which may include search results from the search engine as well as digital content included in or referenced by the search results. Alternatively or additionally the search results database may also store data collected from the one or more search results .

The search results computing system may be configured to obtain the search results by initiating a search to be performed by the search engine using one or more keywords found in the search term database . In some embodiments the search results computing system may be configured to search using keywords resulting from an auto complete feature a predictive word search feature and or a predictive phrase search feature of a mobile device. In some embodiments the keywords may be keywords not associated with an auto complete feature a predictive word search feature and or a predictive phrase search feature of a mobile device.

The search results computing system may be configured to obtain the search results by initiating a search to be performed by the search engine using one or more locations found in the search term database for each of the one or more keywords in the database. The location selector may select a location for which the search may be performed. For example the location selector may select a geographic area such as a country state region metropolitan area city neighborhood or zip code for which the search may be performed by the search engine . In some embodiments to select the location for which the search may be performed the search selector may adjust one or more settings of the search engine that allow a location where the search is to be performed to be set. In other embodiments to select the location for which the search may be performed the search selector may select servers that are located in the selected location for performing the search. Alternately or additionally the search selector may send signals to the search engine to cause the search engine to associate a location with the search. These signals may include information such as an IP address GPS coordinates mobile tower identifiers in a wireless communication system names of the cities along with the keywords among others.

An example of a location based search is as follows a user performing a search in San Francisco may select a setting in a search engine to indicate that the search is being performed in San Francisco. This may allow the search engine to customize searches for the user. For example a search for the search term pizza places may produce results for pizza places in random locations if a location is not set in a search engine. In contrast if a location is set in a search engine either by a user or automatically by the search engine based on an IP address of the user or other information such as a term in the search string the search results provided by the search engine may include pizza places near the location where the search is performed.

In some embodiments the search results obtained from the search engine may vary according to previous searches performed by a user. For example in some embodiments a search engine may consider a profile of a user when generating the search results. In some embodiments the profile of a user may be based on a previous search history occurring at the same IP address or MAC address. For example the profile of a user may be based on a previous search history of the user as determined by cookies or other digital information stored on an electronic device upon which the user performs a search. In some embodiments the profile of a user may be based on a previous search history stored on a server. For example a user may be registered with a search engine and the search engine may store a history of the searches of the user. In some embodiments the profile of a user may be based on the previous search history of the user generated during a current search session. For example if a user performed a first search and then performed a second search related to the first search based on the results from the first search the results generated by the search engine for the second search may be based on the first search performed by the user.

In some embodiments the search results computing system may be configured to obtain the search results by requesting a search to be performed by the search engine with the search results computing system acting as one of multiple types of devices. For example the search results computing system may send the request to the search engine acting as a mobile device or a non mobile device. Alternately or additionally the search results computing system may send the request to the search engine acting as a particular type of mobile device such as a smart phone or a feature phone.

Additionally or alternatively the analytic module may correlate the search results .

The determination module may include one or more algorithms for processing data obtained from the analytic module . For example using the data provided by the analytic module the determination module may be configured to determine a position for digital content or a reference to digital content in each of the search results or a subset of the search results . Additionally or alternatively the determination module may be configured to determine a number of searches performed on a search engine for one or more keywords from a first location. Additionally or alternatively the determination module may be configured to determine a number of searches performed on a search engine for one or more keywords from a first location where one or more of the search terms is a second location. For example the determination module may be able to determine a number of searches being performed for a keyword hotels in New York from Chicago or some other location. The determination module may be able to determine a number of searches being performed based on information received from the search engine . For example the search engine may publish information regarding the frequency of searches performed using the keyword hotels in New York along with other information regarding searches performed in specific locations allowing the determination module to determine the number of searches being performed.

The reporting module may compile information from the analytic module the determination module or both to generate a report and make recommendations regarding keyword performance based on location type of keyword types of device among other things. The keyword performance may be based on a position of digital content related to an entity in a search result. Thus a keyword that generates a search result with digital content in the search result in a better position than another keyword may be deemed to have a better keyword performance.

As an example report the reporting module may be configured to generate reports that compare the performance of keywords that result from auto complete features predictive word search features and or a predictive phrase search feature to keywords that are not of this keyword type in searches performed by mobile devices. Based on this information the managing module may be configured to provide keywords to digital content to optimize the digital content for searches performed by mobile devices as described with respect to .

In some embodiments the reporting module may be configured to generate reports that compare the performance of keywords at locations with different levels of granularity. For example the reporting module may be able to report on the keyword performance across different cities metropolitan areas zip codes or other areas. Based on the report the managing module may suggest different keywords be associated with different locations to optimize digital content for searches performed by mobile devices as described with respect to .

In some embodiments the reporting module may be configured to generate reports that compare the performance of keywords across different types of devices. For example the reporting module may report on the performance of different keywords in non mobile devices and mobile devices.

In some embodiments the reporting module may also be configured to generate reports that indicate search volume of keywords based on the geographic location where the search is performed. In these and other embodiments the reports may highlight locations where numerous searches are being performed for a particular keyword. In these and other embodiments the managing module may suggest the use of the high volume keywords for a location be associated with content associated with the location to increase the ability of digital content to appear in a search result. For example a website may be associated with restaurant in New York. A local news report may have spotlighted the restaurant in a top 10 list. The top 10 list may be keyword that receives multiple searches in New York. The managing module may indicate that the website for the restaurant include the keyword of the top 10 list to increase the likelihood of the website for the restaurant being part of a search result.

In other embodiments the managing module may perform Click Through Rate CTR tracking that compares and distinguishes CTRs on mobile devices vs. non mobile devices. Such a system could use that information combined with other information to deliver performance reporting for broader web management.

The method may being at block where a first search on a network with a search engine using a first keyword may be performed to obtain first search results where the first search is based on a first location. The first search being based on the first location may indicate that the first location is a parameter used by the search engine when conducting the first search.

In these and other embodiments the web analytics may include a number of visits to the reference to the digital content a number of conversions per visit among other metrics. Based on these metrics the recommendation that may result in the greatest increase in traffic conversions revenue or some other metric may be given priority over other recommendations.

In some embodiments the method may further include identifying a third position for a reference to other digital content within the first search results. The other digital content may be controlled and operated by an entity that is different than the entity that controls and operates the digital content. In some embodiments the entity that controls and operates that other digital content may be a competitor of the entity that controls and operates the digital content.

In these and other embodiments the method may further include identifying a fourth position for the reference to the other digital content within the second search results and comparing the third and fourth positions to the first and second positions respectively. When one of or both of the third and fourth positions are higher than the first and second positions respectively or in other circumstances for example when both the third and fourth positions are lower than the first and second positions the method may include generating a recommendation to adapt the digital content to include location data similar to location data associated with the reference to the other digital content.

An example of the method follows a business such as a restaurant may have digital content such as a website that provides users of the website with information about the restaurant and location information about different physical locations of the restaurant. The restaurant may have physical locations across the world. Using the method the restaurant may gain insights into how the restaurant s website is performing in organic searches performed in different locations. For example the website may rank fourth when a search for best steak restaurants is conducted in Miami and rank twelfth when a search for best steak restaurants is conducted in Chicago. By understanding the difference in rankings the website may be adapted to improve the rankings in Chicago. In some instances the search result rankings of the restaurant s website in different locations may be compared with a competitor s restaurant s website search results rankings in the same locations. The restaurant s website may be adapted to include aspects of the competitor s restaurant s website when the competitor s restaurant ranks higher than the restaurant s website in the search results. For example the restaurant s website location data may be made to match the location data of the competitor s restaurant s website.

The location data may be data associated with a physical location of a business corporation or some other entity. In some embodiments the location data may be located on the digital content of the business the corporation or the some other entity.

In these and other embodiments the property module may access the files with the location data . In some embodiments the property module may access the location data by crawling a third party digital content. For example the property module may crawl Yelp or some other website that provides the location data to access the location data .

The property module may also be configured to analyze the location data to determine the properties of the location data that relates to placement of a reference to the digital content in location specific search results. Location specific search results may be search results that are at least partially based on a location parameter that is considered when generating the search results. For example a mobile device may request a search for burgers and send an indication of its current location. The search engine may conduct a search for burgers that includes the parameter of the mobile device s current location and generate results based on the parameter for example burger places near to the physical location of the mobile device. If digital content does not properly include location information the search engine may not display the digital content in the search results.

The various properties may be determined by analyzing the digital content. For example the html code or other code and other aspects of a website may be analyzed to determine the properties of the website.

The various properties of the location data that may be determined by the property module include but are not limited to accuracy of the location data data field types and data field formatting. The data field types may include but is not limited to those previously discussed such as a phone number field an address field a map field and a business hours field. The data fields that are available in the location data may affect how a search engine may treat digital content associated with the location data . For example a search engine may give preferential treatment to digital content that is associated with the location data that includes a map field and an address field. When digital content does not include one of these two fields the digital content may not be placed in search results or in a worse position in the search results.

The accuracy of the location data property may relate to the accuracy of the location data . One or more of the fields of the location data may change for one or more physical locations of a business. The accuracy of the location data property may pertain to how accurate the location data is.

The data field formatting may relate to how the location data is formatted. For example for the phone number field the phone number may include an area code a country code a leading one a dash between number groupings among other formatting issues for a phone number. The formatting of the data fields may affect how a search engine may treat the data fields. For example a data field that is incorrectly formatted may not be considered by as search engine resulting in the digital content associated with the data field not being displayed in search results generated by the search engine.

The property module may indicate to the optimization module what properties the location data includes. The optimization module may be configured to determine optimizations that may be applied to the location data based on the properties of the location data . In some embodiments the optimization module may determine the optimizations that may be applied to the location data based on the properties that the location data is lacking.

For example the optimization module may determine an optimization to be adjusting the format of one or more of the location data fields. In some embodiments the optimization module may receive indications of optimizations to perform from the interface module . These indications may be based on comparisons between location data of the digital content and location data of other digital content. The other digital content may be digital content controlled by a competitor or other digital content of the entity. In some embodiments the other digital content may be placed higher in search results than the digital content. In these and other embodiments the optimization module may receive an indication of the location data for the other digital content. Based on the properties of the digital content the optimization module may determine optimizations for the location data of the digital content so that the location data is more analogous to or conforms more closely with the location data of the other digital content. For example the location data of the other digital content may include stores hours and the location data of the digital content may not include store hours. An optimization may be to include the store hours in the location data .

In some embodiments the optimization module may make the optimizations to the location data directly. For example the optimization module may send new location data to the database . For example the optimization module may re write a file in a content management system to make the optimizations to the location data . Alternately or additionally the optimization module may interface with the database when the database is controlled by a third party and present the new location data to the database .

The recommendation module may be configured to receive optimizations for the location data from the optimization module and present the optimizations in a report or to generate recommendations regarding optimizing the location data. The report may be sent to an entity that controls the content of the location data to allow the entity to adjust the content of the location data .

There is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems the use of hardware or software is generally but not always in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. There are various vehicles by which processes and or systems and or other technologies described herein can be effected e.g. hardware software and or firmware and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and or systems and or other technologies are deployed. For example if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and or firmware vehicle if flexibility is paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation or yet again alternatively the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware software and or firmware.

The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the processes via the use of block diagrams flowcharts and or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams flowcharts and or examples contain one or more functions and or operations it will be understood by those within the art that each function and or operation within such block diagrams flowcharts or examples can be implemented individually and or collectively by a wide range of hardware software firmware or virtually any combination thereof. In some embodiments several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASICs Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs digital signal processors DSPs or other integrated formats. However those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein in whole or in part can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems as one or more programs running on one or more processors e.g. as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors as firmware or as virtually any combination thereof and that designing the circuitry and or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include but are not limited to the following a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk a hard disk drive a CD a DVD a digital tape a computer memory etc. and a transmission type medium such as a digital and or an analog communication medium e.g. a fiber optic cable a waveguide a wired communications link a wireless communication link etc. .

Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and or processes in the fashion set forth herein and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and or processes into data processing systems. That is at least a portion of the devices and or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing a video display device a memory such as volatile and non volatile memory processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors computational entities such as operating systems drivers graphical user interfaces and applications programs one or more interaction devices such as a touch pad or screen and or control systems including feedback loops and control motors e.g. feedback for sensing position and or velocity control motors for moving and or adjusting components and or quantities . A typical data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components such as those generally found in data computing communication and or network computing communication systems.

The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within or connected with different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively associated such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as associated with each other such that the desired functionality is achieved irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise any two components so associated can also be viewed as being operably connected or operably coupled to each other to achieve the desired functionality and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being operably couplable to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and or physically interacting components and or wirelessly interactable and or wirelessly interacting components and or logically interacting and or logically interactable components.

The embodiments described herein may include the use of a special purpose or general purpose computer including various computer hardware or software modules.

Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include computer readable media for carrying or having computer executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example and not limitation such computer readable media can comprise RAM ROM EEPROM CD ROM or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection either hardwired wireless or a combination of hardwired or wireless to a computer the computer properly views the connection as a computer readable medium. Thus any such connection is properly termed a computer readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.

Computer executable instructions comprise for example instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer special purpose computer or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and or methodological acts it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above. Rather the specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.

As used herein the term module or component can refer to software objects or routines that execute on the computing system. The different components modules engines and services described herein may be implemented as objects or processes that execute on the computing system e.g. as separate threads . While the system and methods described herein are preferably implemented in software implementations in hardware or a combination of software and hardware are also possible and contemplated. In this description a computing entity may be any computing system as previously defined herein or any module or combination of modulates running on a computing system.

With respect to the use of substantially any plural and or singular terms herein those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and or application. The various singular plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.

It will be understood by those within the art that in general terms used herein and especially in the appended claims e.g. bodies of the appended claims are generally intended as open terms e.g. the term including should be interpreted as including but not limited to the term having should be interpreted as having at least the term includes should be interpreted as includes but is not limited to etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example as an aid to understanding the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases at least one and one or more to introduce claim recitations. However the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles a or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases one or more or at least one and indefinite articles such as a or an e.g. a and or an should be interpreted to mean at least one or one or more the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number e.g. the bare recitation of two recitations without other modifiers means at least two recitations or two or more recitations . Furthermore in those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B and C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B and C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. . In those instances where a convention analogous to at least one of A B or C etc. is used in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention e.g. a system having at least one of A B or C would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone B alone C alone A and B together A and C together B and C together and or A B and C together etc. . It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms whether in the description claims or drawings should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms either of the terms or both terms. For example the phrase A or B will be understood to include the possibilities of A or B or A and B. 

In addition where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.

As will be understood by one skilled in the art for any and all purposes such as in terms of providing a written description all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves thirds quarters fifths tenths etc. As a non limiting example each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third middle third and upper third etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as up to at least and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. Finally as will be understood by one skilled in the art a range includes each individual member. Thus for example a group having 1 3 cells refers to groups having 1 2 or 3 cells. Similarly a group having 1 5 cells refers to groups having 1 2 3 4 or 5 cells and so forth.

From the foregoing it will be appreciated that various embodiments of the present disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration and that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure. Accordingly the various embodiments disclosed herein are not intended to be limiting with the true scope and spirit being indicated by the following claims.
