This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 912 195 entitled System and Method for Controlling Antenna Tuning Using an Auxiliary Channel of an Embedded Display Port Interface filed on Oct. 26 2010 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to information handling systems and more particularly relates to a system and method for controlling antenna tuning using an auxiliary channel of an embedded display port interface.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system. An information handling system generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements can vary between different applications information handling systems can also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information can be processed stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition information handling systems can include a variety of hardware and software components that can be configured to process store and communicate information and can include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

An information handling system can include an antenna to provide wireless communication capabilities. Depending on the type of wireless communication used in the information handling system there may be different frequency bands that the antenna can utilize to communicate data to and from the information handling system.

The following description in combination with the Figures is provided to assist in understanding the teachings disclosed herein. The following discussion will focus on specific implementations and embodiments of the teachings. This focus is provided to assist in describing the teachings and should not be interpreted as a limitation on the scope or applicability of the teachings. However other teachings can certainly be utilized in this application.

The information handling system includes a display panel a motherboard a wireless wide area network WWAN minicard a tuning circuit an antenna and a digital to analog D A converter . The display panel is in communication with the motherboard via an embedded display port eDP interface . The display panel is in communication with the D A converter via a general purpose input output GPIO bus. The motherboard is in communication with the WWAN minicard via a universal serial bus USB .

The display panel includes an extended display identification EDID memory a display a display control circuit an eDP sink function and a backlight control . The display control circuit can include the eDP sink function and is in communication with the D A converter with the display EDID memory and with the display . The motherboard includes a video graphics processing circuit a processing subsystem and an eDP source function . The eDP sink function is in communication with the eDP source function via a main link channel an auxiliary channel and a hot plug detect channel of the eDP interface . The video graphics processing circuit is in communication with the backlight control . The processing subsystem includes a radio middleware application and an antenna tuning applet . The radio middleware application is in communication with the WWAN minicard . The radio middleware application is also in communication with the antenna tuning applet which in turn is in communication with the video graphics processing circuit .

The tuning circuit includes a capacitor a resistor and inductors and . The capacitor includes first and second terminals. The resistor includes a first terminal connected to the D A converter and a second terminal connected to the second terminal of the capacitor . The inductor includes a first terminal connected to the first terminal of the capacitor and to the WWAN minicard and a second terminal connected to the WWAN minicard. The inductor includes a first terminal connected to the second terminal of the capacitor and to the antenna and a second terminal connected to the second terminal of the inductor and to the antenna.

The capacitor the resistor and the inductors and of the tuning circuit can be configured to tune the antenna to a specific frequency band for wireless communication. During operation the WWAN minicard can utilize the tuning circuit and the antenna to receive and or transmit data during a wireless communication session of the information handling system . In different embodiments the WWAN minicard can be any wireless radio device such as a radio device on the motherboard that can receive and or transmit data during a wireless communication session of the information handling system . The information handling system can be any portable device with an antenna for wireless communication such as a laptop computer a tablet computer a cellular telephone a portable multimedia player or the like. The WWAN minicard can receive data from the antenna via the RF coaxial cable and the tuning circuit . The antenna can be variably tuned to provide the information handling system with wireless coverage in frequency bands associated with a Long Term Evolution LTE wireless communication standard such as LTE band LTEB 17 700 746 Mega hertz MHz LTEB 13 746 787 MHz GSM 850 MHz and CDMA 900 MHz. The antenna can be tuned to each of the different frequency bands by adjusting the resonance frequency of the antenna. Thus the antenna can be dynamically tuned such that the resonance of the antenna can be set within a spectrum of a desired frequency band. The resonance frequency of the antenna can be adjusted by changing the capacitance of the capacitor which can be a Barium Strontium Titanate BST capacitor a set of pin diodes or the like. The BST capacitor can be a ferroelectric thin film capacitor that can require a high voltage to change the capacitance of the BST capacitor. The set of pin diodes can be cathode diodes pointing toward each other that are connected to a bias voltage to keep the diodes in an on state. The capacitance of the pin diodes can be adjusted with a low voltage based on changing a bias current provided to the pine diodes. The capacitance of the capacitor can vary based on a voltage applied to the capacitor. Therefore the resonance frequency of the antenna can vary based on a change in the capacitance of the capacitor as controlled by the voltage applied to the capacitor.

The antenna can be initially set up so that the resonance frequency of the antenna is within one frequency band of the different frequency bands stated above. In this situation if the D A converter does not provide a voltage to the capacitor the antenna can be tuned to the frequency band initially set for the antenna. However if a voltage is provided to the capacitor the antenna can be tuned to either a higher or lower frequency band based on the design of the tuning circuit . Thus the WWAN minicard can communicate with another device via the frequency band to which the antenna is initially tuned. However if the WWAN minicard determines that a new frequency band is to be utilized in the antenna the WWAN minicard can cause the capacitance of the capacitor to change and cause the resonance frequency antenna to change to another frequency band.

The WWAN minicard can use the radio middleware application and the antenna tuning applet to provide an antenna tuning control signal to the video graphics processing circuit . The radio middleware application can be an application programming interface API that can enable the WWAN minicard to interact with and communicate with drivers of the motherboard such as the eDP source function . Thus the WWAN minicard can send the antenna tuning control signal to the video graphics processing circuit which in turn can send the antenna tuning control signal across the auxiliary channel of the eDP interface to the eDP sink function . When the antenna tuning control signal is detected in the eDP sink function the display control circuit can set a voltage on one or more port pins of the GPIO bus connecting the display control circuit to the D A converter . When one or more voltages are detected on the port pins the D A converter can output a voltage to the capacitor based on the detected voltages of the port pins. The voltage can cause a change in the capacitance of the capacitor and cause a change in the resonance frequency of the antenna .

For example there may be four different frequency bands to which the antenna can be tuned. The WWAN minicard can send first second third and fourth antenna tuning control signals to the video graphics processing circuit via the radio middleware application and the antenna tuning applet . The first second third or fourth antenna tuning control signal can then be sent from the eDP source function across the auxiliary channel of the eDP interface and to the eDP sink function of the display control circuit . When the display control circuit receives one of the first second third or fourth antenna tuning control signals the display control circuit can set a different port pin configuration on the GPIO bus based on the antenna tuning control signal received. In an embodiment there can be two port pins of the GPIO bus such that the port pins can be set to four different port pin configurations.

The D A converter can vary the voltage provided to the capacitor and the resonance frequency of the antenna based on the port pin configuration. The antenna can then be tuned to one of the four frequencies stated above based on the voltage from the D A converter . For example if there is not a voltage applied to the capacitor the antenna can have a first resonance frequency within one of the LTE frequency bands. When the D A converter applies one of three voltages to the capacitor the resonance frequency of the antenna can either increase or decrease depending on the design of the antenna and the tuning circuit . Thus the resonance frequency of the antenna can vary among the four different frequency ranges based on the antenna tuning control signal sent across the auxiliary channel of the eDP interface to cause the D A converter to provide a desired voltage to the capacitor .

In another embodiment the WWAN minicard can utilize the radio middleware application and the antenna tuning applet to switch the resonance frequency between only two different resonance frequencies. The process of providing the antenna tuning control signal to cause the D A converter to apply a voltage to the capacitor can be similar to that described above. However the antenna tuning control signal can cause the D A converter to switch between on off states and can cause the antenna to switch between the two resonance frequencies. While the tuning of a single antenna was described it should be understood that another antenna can be tuned between another group of frequency bands.

At block a voltage is provided from the display control circuit to a digital to analog converter in response to the control signal received on the auxiliary channel of the eDP interface. An antenna tuning voltage is generated in the digital to analog converter based on the voltage from the display control circuit at block . At block the antenna is switched from the first resonance frequency to the second resonance frequency based on the antenna tuning voltage.

At block a port pin configuration of the display control circuit is set in response to the control signal received on the auxiliary channel of the eDP interface. At block the port pin configuration is provided to a digital to analog converter. An antenna tuning voltage is generated in the digital to analog converter based on the port pin configuration from the display control circuit at block . At block the antenna is set to the new resonance frequency based on the antenna tuning voltage and the flow diagram can repeat as stated above at block .
