This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 785 163 filed on Mar. 14 2013 entitled GUIDED WAVE OPTO ACOUSTIC DEVICE AND METHODS FOR MAKING THE SAME the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was developed under contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

Photon phonon coupling through guided wave stimulated Brillouin scattering SBS is finding application in numerous technology fields such as tailorable slow light radio frequency RF photonic signal processing narrow line width laser sources RF waveform synthesis optical frequency comb generation etc. Realization of this form of travelling wave photon phonon coupling in a silicon based and CMOS complementary metal oxide semiconductor compatible platform can enable high performance signal processing applications through nanoscale Brillouin interactions. Nanoscale modal confinement can enhance non linear lightmatter interactions within silicon waveguides and in nanooptomechanics. For instance tight optical confinement in nanoscale silicon waveguides can be responsible for greatly enhanced Raman and Kerr non linearities and for new sensing actuation and transduction mechanisms based on optical forces within nano optomechanical systems.

The field of cavity optomechanics has produced a wide variety of systems with enhanced and controllable forms of photon phonon coupling. Specifically silicon Si based cavityoptomechanical systems have enabled powerful new forms of quantum state transfer slow light phonon lasers and optomechanical ground state cooling. Such cavity systems exploit resonantly enhanced coupling between discrete photonic and phononic modes. As a fundamental complement to cavity systems guided wave Brillouin processes can produce coupling between a continuum of photon and phonon modes for a host of wideband e.g. 0.1 34 GHz RF and photonic signal processing applications. For example travelling wave Brillouin processes have enabled unique schemes for optical pulse compression pulse and waveform synthesis coherent frequency comb generation variable bandwidth optical amplifiers reconfigurable filters and coherent beam combining schemes. Although there are numerous applications and opportunities for chip scale Brillouin technologies the ability for conventional systems to achieve Brillouin processes in silicon nanophotonics has proven difficult strong Brillouin nonlinearities require large optical forces and tight confinement of both phonons and photons conditions that are not met in conventional Si waveguides.

The various embodiments presented herein relate to various hybrid phononic photonic waveguide structures that can exhibit nonlinear behavior associated with traveling wave forward stimulated Brillouin scattering forward SBS . The various structures can simultaneously guide photons and phonons in a suspended membrane. By utilizing a suspended membrane it is possible to eliminate a substrate pathway for loss of phonons that suppresses SBS in conventional silicon on insulator SOI waveguides. Consequently forward SBS nonlinear susceptibilities are achievable with a Brillouin non linear coefficient that is more than about 3000 times greater than achievable with a conventional waveguide system. Owing to the strong phonon photon coupling achievable with the various embodiments herein potential application for the various embodiments presented herein cover a range of radiofrequency RF and photonic signal processing applications including pulse compression pulse and waveform synthesis coherent frequency comb generation optical amplification optical filtration coherent beam combining etc. Further the various embodiments presented herein are applicable to applications operating over a wide bandwidth e.g. 100 MHz to 50 GHz or more.

Further presented herein is experimental data related to measuring the Brillouin nonlinearity of a waveguide whereby pump radiation at 1556 nm was intensity modulated at a variable RF frequency 2 to produce two sidebands respectively upshifted and downshifted by the RF frequency. The modulated pump radiation was mixed with probe radiation at 1536 nm and injected into the waveguide. Interference between the sidebands at the beat frequency produced Stokes and anti Stokes shifted probe radiation by forward SBS at values of that correspond to phononic resonances. The waveguide output was filtered to remove the pump radiation and the frequency shifted probe radiation was measured in a heterodyne detector that combined the filtered waveguide output with a local oscillator signal produced by imposing a small frequency offset on a tapped off portion of the 1536 nm probe radiation.

Any suitable material can be utilized for the respective structural elements comprising waveguide device . For example substrate can be formed from silicon Si insulator layer can be formed from silicon dioxide SiO waveguide can be formed from any suitable waveguide forming material such as Si and membrane can be formed from silicon nitride SiN whereby the membrane layer can be in a state of tension. In an embodiment waveguide can be nanophotonic and further can have dimensions width w 313 nm and height h 194 nm while membrane can have a thickness t 124 nm.

As described further herein slots and can be utilized to facilitate formation of a cavity . Slots and can be further utilized to effectively operate as a reflector of acoustic waves having wavevectors substantially transverse e.g. direction P to an optical propagation direction e.g. direction O . Hence each pair of slots e.g. slots and can form an acoustic resonator capable of defining a series of discrete phononic resonances in at least the range of 1 18 GHz. In the exemplary embodiment slots and can be 2 m wide by 100 m long. Hence regions and are accordingly truncated on either side of the waveguide by the symmetrically placed slots and . The geometry of device can facilitate independent control of the photonic and phononic properties of a Brillouin waveguide enabling the phonon mode spectrum to be tailored independently from the optical force distributions within the core of the waveguide .

On the basis of the phase matching condition and the relation K k only guided phonons with phase velocities matching the group velocity of light produce resonant coupling through forward SBS. Such an effect can be a result of the interference between the co propagating pump and Stokes waves. In an embodiment the interference yields modulated energy density and force density distributions that propagate along the waveguide at the group velocity of light. As this travelling force distribution drives photon phonon coupling only phonons with phase velocities K matching the group velocity of light can produce efficient coupling e.g. as presented as circles in . These ultra high phase velocity guided phonon modes e.g. of about 10ms have corresponding guided phonon group velocities K that are exceedingly slow 1 ms but are non zero.

The displacement field associated with each of the phase matched Brillouin active guided wave modes m 1 7 are shown in . Labeling of each mode e.g. m 1 m 2 . . . m 7 is according to the mode index identified in . Further the right half membrane region of each displacement field is shown in each of . The symmetric force distributions as presented in permit coupling of photons in the waveguide core to phonons with symmetric displacement fields about the waveguide core . Hence it can be considered that the membrane regions will undergo the same effects as the illustrated modes of . Periodic boundary conditions can be applied to the z normal faces of the simulations to facilitate computation of the displacement fields of the phase matched phonon modes presented in and the corresponding phonon dispersion curves in . Although these guided elastic modes can exhibit some flexural character the vast majority of the modal potential energy can be ascribed to in plane elastic compression e.g. directions x z . The compressive character of these slow group velocity guided modes can be most clearly seen in the high frequency limit as demonstrated by the displacement fields of m 6 and m 7. For small K values the z component of the phonon displacement field can become much smaller than the x component. Moreover in the limiting case where the waveguide possesses vertical symmetry e.g. where t h then the Brillouin active modes can converge to symmetric Lamb waves with nearly identical dispersion curves to those presented in . is a representation of an optical wave vector mismatch k produced by the dispersion of the optical waveguide mode k as pump and Stokes waves are detuned. Accordingly the waves can be classified as symmetric Lamb waves producing equal frequency spacing of the phase matched Brillouin modes as shown in .

Full vectorial multi physics simulations based on waveguide device were performed and conveyed the elastic wave motion for seven characteristic Brillouin active phonon modes. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the z normal faces of the simulation domains of to facilitate capture of the nature of a respective travelling wave for the guided phonons at the phase matched K values identified in . Accordingly present seven characteristic Brillouin active phonon modes m 1 7 at respective frequencies 1.28 3.72 6.18 GHz etc. As previously mentioned in an aspect the phonon modes presented in can be considered corresponding to symmetric Lamb waves.

Based upon the foregoing a waveguide device was formed with a series of 26 reflector pairs e.g. 26 pairs of slots and along the path traversed by an optical waveguide to facilitate formation of a Brillouin active length of 3.3 mm in a total device length of 4.9 mm. In an aspect a 3.3 mm Brillouin active device length coincides with a total non linear phase mismatch K L of between 0.45 and 5.7 radian for the range of Brillouin active modes presented in . In an embodiment each suspended waveguide section e.g. a length of waveguide core that has an adjacent slot and is separated by a 25 m anchored or unsuspended region as indicated by region M. In an embodiment waveguide device produces a significant non linear phase mismatch along its length. Hence the various embodiments relating to waveguide device can be treated as a phase matched travelling wave process to facilitate describing the coherent addition of non linearities along the entire length of the waveguide in waveguide device .

A plurality of waveguide devices have been studied with waveguide widths w ranging from 0.8 3.8 mm which produced a range of Brillouin resonances over a frequency range of 1 18 GHz. As an optical group velocity changes by only a few percent over a 30 nm wavelength range the optical phase mismatch with values K L 2 can have negligible change over an appreciable wavelength range. Accordingly the same guided phonon can be excited by continuum of different wavelengths within the waveguide device even though the waveguide device can operate as a phase matched non linear process. Such operation enables waveguide device to operate with pump and probe waves of disparate wavelengths to couple to each other through the Brillouin active modes of a single waveguide device .

To facilitate further understanding presents data derived from testing of a waveguide device wherein as previously mentioned the waveguide device was formed to comprise 26 reflector pairs e.g. slots and along the path traversed by an optical waveguide to facilitate formation of a Brillouin active length of 3.3 mm in a total device length of 4.9 mm. Experimental studies of a Brillouin non linearity were performed with a heterodyne FWM apparatus facilitating direct measurement of the third order non linear susceptibility. During the FWM experiments a modulated pump signal e.g. 1 556 nm and continuous wave probe signal e.g. 1 536 nm are injected into a waveguide of waveguide device . The modulated pump signal can drive the excitation of Brillouin active phonons over a wide range of frequencies as the pump modulation frequency is swept through a range of values. The non linear response of the waveguide device can be subsequently analyzed by heterodyne measurement of optical tones imprinted on the disparate probe wavelength as a result of a coherent combination of the Brillouin and third order electronic non linear susceptibilities e.g. through FWM . Any signal sidebands can then be analyzed as distinct RF tones through heterodyne interferometry. Such an approach enables the Stokes and anti Stokes signatures to be resolved separately.

As presented in signatures showing a non linear Brillouin response can be observed by measuring an intensity of non linearly induced sidebands imprinted on a probe signal as the frequency of a pump modulation signal was swept from 1 to 18 GHz. The spectra in were obtained by integrating the RF power produced by heterodyne detection of a probe signal including both Stokes and anti Stokes sidebands over a discrete set of high frequency RF bands using RF filters. To remove the frequency dependence of the detection system and to more clearly exhibit the sharp Brillouin resonances the spectra in were normalized to those of an identical optical waveguide without a Brillouin active region. Each waveguide produces a series of regularly spaced Brillouin resonances analogous to those identified in .

Owing in part to a spatial symmetry of the optical force distribution only phonon modes with even displacement symmetry with respect to the waveguide core produce efficient Brillouin coupling. A total of 17 resonances are presented in where each respective resonance from . . . . . . is connected by mode order plots where plot is mode m 1 plot is mode m 2 plot is mode m 3 plot is mode m 4 plot is mode m 5 plot is mode m 6 and plot is mode m 7 to indicate the mode order of each phononic resonance as the Brillouin spectrum shifts with waveguide dimension.

As shown in four waveguide devices are presented with respective waveguide dimension width d where plot d 0.8 m plot d 1.8 m plot d 2.8 m and plot d 3.8 m where width d is the phononic distance between two opposite slits e.g. slits and as shown in . The 17 resonances are observed as the frequency is swept between 1 and 18 GHz.

As shown plots are also simulated mode frequencies over the range of device dimensions and good agreement occurs between the observed resonances and the anticipated values e.g. an anticipated value occurring where a mode plot intersects a waveguide dimension plot .

With further reference to the resonance signatures presented in a Fano like line shape can be seen to be produced by each Brillouin resonance from which the magnitude of the Brillouin non linear coefficient can be obtained. The Fano like line shape can be seen in the high resolution spectral scans of which show the line shape of a characteristic Brillouin resonance f 6.185 GHz with d 3.8 m decomposed into its Stokes e.g. and anti Stokes e.g. components. The data presented was obtained by spectrally resolving distinct heterodyne tones of the Stokes and anti Stokes signals using a high resolution RF spectrum analyzer as the pump modulation frequency was swept from about 6.16 GHz to about 6.2 GHz. The asymmetric line shapes shown in plots and result from the coherent interference between the Brillouin and electronic Kerr non linearities of the waveguide device . Involvement of electronic Kerr non linearities at the Stokes and anti Stokes frequencies can occur due to cross phase modulation between a pump beam and a probe beam propagating in the silicon waveguide core .

To facilitate determination of the magnitude of the Brillouin nonlinear coefficient relative to the intrinsic Kerr non linear coefficient and the non linear free carrier dispersion coefficient from the data presented in and non linear coupled amplitude equations were formulated to derive the functional form of the Stokes and anti Stokes line shapes. The equations are presented herein as Eqns. 1a 7 below accompanied with explanatory text.

Owing to SBS being a resonant effect a SBS non linear coefficient can form a Lorentzian line shape centred about each Brillouin active phonon mode. In contrast the electronic Kerr non linearities are nonresonant at 1 550 nm wavelengths yielding a frequency independent non linear coefficient. As is known in the art the frequency dependent interference between the Kerr and Brillouin effects can produce the asymmetric e.g. Fano like line shape as shown in plots and . However it should be noted that the experimental arrangement utilized to measure the values presented in is distinct leading to a different set of coupled amplitude equations. In addition non linearly generated free carriers in Si can be responsible for the dissimilar line shapes of the Stokes and anti Stokes orders and a larger nonlinear background for frequencies below 2 GHz under the experimental conditions utilized herein. As the free carrier effects roll off at high frequency the Kerr responses at 16 GHz are used as a reference to determine the magnitude of the Brillouin non linear coefficient.

On the basis of the coupled amplitude model described with reference to Eqns. 1a 7 the magnitude of the Brillouin non linear coefficient can be extracted from the experimental line shape of both the Stokes and anti Stokes signatures of each resonance of the waveguide device having a width d 3.8 m.

Seven resonances spanning frequencies from 1.28 to 16.30 GHz are shown in . The peak value of and the phononic Q factor of each resonance extracted from experiments including separately resolved Stokes and anti Stokes signatures are shown respectively. The peak value of the Brillouin non linear coefficient at 1.28 GHz is found to be 6.18 times larger than the Kerr non linear coefficient of the waveguide or 6.18 .

From the established non linearities of Si of 188 34 Wmwere determined for a waveguide device with w 1.8 2.8 3.8 m per Eqns. 1 7 herein . From this relative measurement the Brillouin non linear coefficient is found to be 1.164 244 Wmover the Brillouin active region of the waveguide device . Moreover as the Brillouin non linear coefficient is related to the Brillouin gain as 2 G this nonlinearity corresponds to a forward SBS gain of G 2 328 488 Wm.

It is to be noted that much of the 18 and 21 uncertainty assigned to and values respectively can arise from the 15 uncertainty in the measured value of the Kerr non linearity for silicon. Despite the fact that this non linear response is the aggregate of an ensemble of 26 distinct Brillouin active suspended regions fabricated along the length of the waveguide device as previously described high mechanical Q factors 1 000 are produced for phonon frequencies of about 1.28 to about 16.3 GHz.

For comparison with experiments full vectorial three dimensional multi physics simulations were performed through coupled optical force and elastic wave finite element analysis and simulation models. The distinct contributions of ES forces plot orange radiation pressure plot blue and thermoelastic expansion to the total SBS nonlinear coefficient plot black are shown in for each phonon resonance mode m 1 7. A fixed mechanical Q factor of Q 1 000 is assumed. Note that negligible contribution to the Brillouin coupling is produced by thermoelastic response at these GHz frequencies due to at least in part the slow thermal time constant of this system for further details refer to Eqns. 1 7 and accompanying text . The magnitude of the Brillouin coefficient scales quadratically with optical force yielding a non linear addition of the radiation pressure and electrostrictively induced couplings to the overall Brillouin gain as shown in . The total Brillouin non linearity which is almost exclusively driven by radiation pressure and electrostriction slowly decreases with increasing resonant frequency as further shown in .

A larger variation in Brillouin non linearity is seen from the experimental data e.g. circles of than from simulations e.g. black bars of due to the variation of the measured phononic Q with frequency per . However when the frequency dependence of measured Q factors is included in simulations per good agreement between simulations and experiments are obtained over the entire frequency range per the green bars and the circles of .

Both the highly localized electrostriction and radiation pressure force distributions within a waveguide core yield a frequency dependent Brillouin gain as shown in exhibiting a significant departure from conventional backwards SBS processes involving bulk acoustic waves. In contrast to the rapid 1 roll off of Brillouin gain with phonon frequency found through backward SBS the experimental and simulated Q factor normalized Brillouin coefficient varies by less than 40 in magnitude over the entire 1 16 GHz frequency range.

Unlike conventional systems where the overlap between the optical force distribution and the phonon mode profile is largely frequency independent the complex double lobed spatial force distributions in the core of the silicon waveguide can produce a frequency dependent overlap with various phonon modes reshaping the frequency dependence of Brillouin coupling. The effect of spatial force distribution on the frequency dependence of coupling can be seen by comparing the computed contributions of electrostriction and radiation pressure to the Brillouin gain of . Although the radiation pressure contribution diminishes quite rapidly with frequency the ES component varies by only a few percent over the 1 16 GHz frequency range. The higher bandwidth of ES coupling can result from the higher spatial frequencies of the ES force distribution. Consequently the relatively flat Brillouin gain produces efficient photon phonon coupling over an unprecedented frequency range.

The magnitude and frequency dependence of the measured Brillouin coupling and the good agreement with simulations all provide strong evidence of the important role of both electrostriction and radiation pressure within the waveguide devices formed in accord with the various embodiments presented herein.

The series of Brillouin resonances generated by a waveguide device having d 3.8 m can provide insight into the bandwidth and frequency dependence of the Brillouin coupling.

However a larger overall Brillouin non linearity can be achieved with a higher degree of phonon confinement that is for smaller values of d. shows the Stokes and anti Stokes spectral line shapes obtained by through measurement of the d 0.8 m waveguide device . In contrast to the d 3.8 m device several sharp spectral features consistent with high Q factor Q 1 500 phononic resonances are observed within the central Brillouin line shape suggesting significant inhomogeneous broadening which may be due to fabrication non uniformities.

A fit of the aggregate Brillouin line shape using a single Lorentzian oscillator model yields is seen in yielding Gand Q values of G 4 150 872 Wmand Q 280. However uncertainty in the form of inhomogeneously broadened line shape made it difficult to obtain a high confidence estimate of the Brillouin non linearity in this case prompting exploration for Brillouin non linearities through direct measurement of Brillouin gain.

Experimental studies of Brillouin gain were performed by injecting strong pump and weak signal fields into a Brillouin active waveguide w 0.8 m . A low spectral intensity amplified spontaneous emission ASE probe signal centre wavelength 1 552.94 nm bandwidth 50 GHz was used in conjunction with a high intensity pump laser 1 552.723 nm or 1 553.158 nm to perform Brillouin gain measurements about the Stokes and anti Stokes frequencies respectively. The spectral power density of the ASE signal beam was measured by monitoring the heterodyne interference between the pump and signal fields with a receiver and a RF spectrum analyzer SA for frequencies about the Brillouin resonance e.g. v 5.68 GHz .

The transmitted ASE power spectral density for higher pump powers are normalized to the power spectral density at lower pump powers e.g. about 2.6 mW to observe the power dependent form of the Stokes and anti Stokes line shapes. The normalized Stokes and anti Stokes transmittances for P 12 14 and 20 mW are shown in respectively. The finer structure produced by inhomogeneous broadening is not visible owing to the smaller signal to noise ratio obtained by this method.

Lorentzian fits of the Stokes and anti Stokes line shapes yield a Q factor of approximately 300 indicating significant inhomogeneous broadening. As the anti Stokes process involves transfer of energy from the signal to the pump beam the anti Stokes signature as shown e.g. in exhibits depletion instead of gain as shown in .

In theoretical line fitting curves are indicated in conjunction with experimental data presented in the form of circles. In the small signal limit which is explored in the experiments the SBS gain is proportional to the pump power and the amplification and also depletion at resonant center frequency is linear with the pump power as shown in . A total effective forward SBS gain of G 2 750 1 200 Wmwas extracted by fitting the data in . This measurement also shows good agreement with the simulated value of Brillouin gain G 2 750 540 Wm. It is to be noted that the derived values for Brillouin gain are more than a factor of 10 larger than those obtained by treating the Brillouin non linearities of Si as a bulk medium property which accordingly provides strong evidence of the role of boundaries in shaping non linearity at sub wavelength scales.

The previously presented measurements demonstrate a gain coefficient that is over 1 000 times larger than forward SBS obtainable in a conventional system such as waveguide fibers and several times larger than the Raman gain produced by Si making Brillouin non linearities the dominant third order non linearity in the waveguide device in accord with the various embodiments herein.

In accord with the various embodiments presented herein travelling wave Brillouin non linearities and Brillouin gain in waveguide device through a novel class of hybrid photonic phononic waveguides are further described. Through quantitative measurements forward SBS non linear susceptibilities were measured to be more than one thousand times stronger than a conventional waveguide system. Multi physics simulations reveal that this strong photon phonon coupling is produced by a constructive combination of ES forces and radiation pressures at the nanoscale. The emergence of large radiation pressure induced couplings represents a new form of boundary induced Brillouin non linearity and a new regime of boundary mediated Brillouin coupling that arises in subwavelength structures.

The embodiments presented herein enable independent control of phononic modes and optomechanical driving forces to yield tailorable Brillouin coupling over exceptionally wide bandwidths. Simultaneous coupling to numerous transverse phonon modes yields a relatively flat Brillouin gain over this entire 1 18 GHz frequency range. Further structural tuning of phononic resonances from 1 to 18 GHz with high quality factor 41 000 yields tailorable non linear optical susceptibilities due to the coherent interference of Kerr and Brillouin effects.

Further the various embodiments presented herein indicate a wideband nature of the photon phonon coupling results from the highly localized optical forces produced within the nanoscale waveguide device . The wideband and high frequency 1.g. about 18 GHz characteristics can be achieved without a requirement for ultra high resolution lithography significantly extending the frequency range of chip scale photon phonon coupling over conventional cavity optomechanical technologies.

Efficient coupling between a continuum of optical and phononic modes through such chip scale travelling wave Brillouin processes facilitates application in a range of technologies utilizing wideband signal processing capabilities with CMOS compatible silicon photonics including pulse compression pulse and waveform synthesis coherent frequency comb generation variable bandwidth optical amplifiers and filters and coherent beam combining schemes. Travelling wave Brillouin non linearities can also produce optical phase conjugation and opto acoustic isolators for application in reducing signal distortion and eliminating parasitic reflection on silicon chips. In addition the highly controllable nature of the phonons emitted by the waveguide devices presented herein operating as a hybrid photonic phononic system can facilitate forms of coherent information transduction through travelling wave processes that are complementary to conventional cavity optomechanical systems.

As efficient Brillouin based photon phonon conversion is possible over wide bandwidths 20 GHz and the Brillouin emitted phonons can be guided and manipulated on chip hybridization of Brillouin device physics with silicon photonics CMOS and microelectromechanical systems can provide a host of new coherent signal processing technologies.

It is to be appreciated that the dimensions and frequency bands presented above are to be understood as merely exemplary and not limiting. For example the spacing of the air slots and may be as small as the width of the optical waveguide and may be as great as 20 m or more as may be permitted by the mechanical strength of the membrane . In an aspect degradation in the resonant behavior of the phononic resonators does not appear to be a limiting factor as the quality factor of the resonator is only weakly dependent if at all on the width of the resonator. Hence device and similarly formed devices can be effective over a bandwidth as great as 100 MHz to 50 GHz or even more. Further the optical waveguide device can be fabricated with a width d of 2.0 m or higher.

As previously mentioned membrane can act to confine the generated phonons. As shown in the phase matching diagrams of a forward SBS process phase matches to phonons with a vanishing longitudinal wave vector i.e. slow group velocity guided phonon states . Hence at least for certain applications it might be necessary to engineer high Q factor phononic resonances that support modes of large transverse wave vector i.e. perpendicular to the waveguide . High Q factor phononic resonances can be achieved by truncating the membrane on either side of the waveguide with etched air slots and e.g. of dimension 2 100 m per the structure shown in . The slots and can act to reflect acoustic waves which can further define the extended phonon modes. This geometry which can be termed produces efficient photon phonon coupling over a series of discrete phononic resonances between 1 18 GHz through a traveling wave forward SBS process.

Numerous variations on the layout described above with reference to waveguide device are possible and are considered to fall within the scope of the various embodiments presented herein. For example the air slots and may be replaced by reflective features of other kinds One such alternate reflective feature is a phononic crystal defined e.g. by a two dimensional array of holes etched through the membrane. Another alternate type of reflective feature is a Bragg grating. presents a waveguide device where the slotted reflectors of device are replaced with an array of holes and e.g. a pair of phononic crystals located on either side of a waveguide core . Holes and can be formed in a membrane layer which can be formed over a cavity which has been formed in an insulating layer on a substrate . As per device the respective components of device can be formed from materials such as Si e.g. substrate and waveguide core SiO e.g. insulating layer and SiN e.g. membrane .

In an aspect compared with a slot reflector e.g. slots and device a device formed with phononic crystal mirrors hole arrays and can facilitate controllable tailored leakage or coupling of energy from a waveguide core e.g. waveguide core . The controllable leakage e.g. across a resonance frequency range of about 1 20 GHz can facilitate resonant transfer of information or phonons between waveguides in the absence of optical energy transfer. Further phononic crystal waveguides can be fabricated with longer phononic resonator regions than can be formed with a slot waveguide device. This can eliminate the problem of anchoring losses for the phonons which occurs with slot waveguide devices e.g. as can occur at region .

In other embodiments the reflective features and of device can have a disposition that is not symmetric about the optical waveguide . For example as shown in a pair of optical waveguides and can be formed in a waveguide device . Waveguides and can be disposed parallel to each other and sufficiently near each other to be optically coupled whereby the coupling can be by a phononic region located between waveguides and . Accordingly rather than optical cross talk coupling the waveguides and the coupling is phononic.

In a conventional approach if two signals are transmitted down a single waveguide undesirable cross talk can occur between the two signal wavelengths owing to non linearities that may be present. Such an undesirable interaction can occur in Si waveguides. However by utilizing two separate waveguides and each respective signal in each waveguide can communicate with the other signal via the phonons. Accordingly a pure communication can occur between the two waveguides and with narrow resonances available through which the waveguides and can transfer information.

In an embodiment the dual waveguide device is amenable to narrow acoustic or phononic resonance which can act as an optical filter as the resonances can be in the order of 1 MHz wide. Such narrow or acoustic resonance can be particularly useful for radio frequency signal processing and filtering.

In an illustrative scenario a pump signal Pis injected into waveguide in conjunction with a modulated information signal Mwhich carries the signal information. Accordingly Pand Mcan beat together with the information in Mbeing transduced as a function of the beat note. In the second waveguide a continuous light beam Scan be injected. As light beam Spasses through the waveguide side bands can be developed whereby the sidebands can be affected by the transduction originating in waveguide and being carried over region . Accordingly information comprising Mcan be carried over to the Sbeam leading to Sbeing modified to a beam SM whereby SMincludes information transferred over from M.

In another embodiment a waveguide device can be formed with confocal resonators. For example as shown in a waveguide device can be formed comprising a pair of confocal resonators and formed in membrane . Accordingly the confocal resonators and can act to focus phonons at a central region located in resonator regions and operating adjacent to waveguide core .

In further embodiments phononic resonators as described above can be traversed by an optical waveguide that is curved and not straight. For example a Brillouin laser may include an optical resonator that consists of an optical waveguide conformed in a closed curve such as a circle dimensioned to resonate at a Stokes shifted or anti Stokes shifted pump frequency and disposed on a path that traverses one or more phononic resonators. When excited by pump radiation introduced e.g. by optical coupling from an adjacent waveguide the optical resonator may exhibit gain at the resonant frequency thus producing amplified Stokes or anti Stokes radiation. Similar arrangements may serve as optical amplifiers optical filters and the like. For example a Brillouin waveguide can facilitate amplifying a weak signal when in the presence of a pump signal to form an amplified output signal.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that depending on the application any of the various inputs to such a system may be deemed the signal input and likewise any of the various outputs may be deemed the signal output. Hence a system similar to the measurement system previously described can operate to produce an output optical signal in response to an input optical signal an output optical signal in response to an input RF signal an output RF signal in response to an input optical signal or an output RF signal in response to an input RF signal.

In the system described above RF modulation can be utilized to excite the phonons. On the other hand phononic excitation may occur without RF modulation in systems that exhibit gain at the Stokes or anti Stokes frequency. One such example is provided above i.e. the Brillouin laser using a ring resonator i.e. a circular resonant waveguide. As shown in a waveguide device can be utilized in conjunction with a circular resonant waveguide . A pump laser and a signal laser can be utilized to generate respective pump signals and signals which can be transmitted into a waveguide . Waveguide can be coupled to the circular resonant waveguide whereby Brillouin SBS can occur between the circular resonant waveguide and waveguide . Based upon the combination of coupling and Brillouin SBS the output signal can be delayed with respect to the laser pump signal . In a further example that operates on similar principles the ring resonator is omitted and instead the resonant cavity can be defined by a pair of Bragg gratings formed in the optical waveguide traversing the phononic resonators.

As shown in a process of deep ultraviolet UV lithography a deep silicon etch DPS followed by a resist strip a standard post etch and a pre diffusion clean can facilitate formation of a waveguide on the surface of the insulator layer .

Any suitable process can be utilized to form a SiNlayer as shown in . Such a process can include a low pressure chemical vapour deposition LPCVD operation. The nitride layer is deposited on the exposed surface of the insulating layer and also over the waveguide where in an example embodiment nitride layer can be 300 nm thickness.

In a chemical mechanical polish CMP can be performed to preferentially thin the conformal nitride layer atop the waveguide . A wet etch such as hot phosphoric acid etch can also be utilized to clear any remaining nitride atop the waveguide .

It is to be appreciated that while the foregoing embodiments e.g. devices and have presented devices where the waveguide core e.g. waveguide core is formed from a different material from that used for the resonator membrane e.g. layer other embodiments are envisaged in which the waveguide core and the membrane layer are formed from the same material. For example presents a scanning electron micrograph of a dual photonic crystal waveguide device wherein the waveguide cores and membranes are formed from the same material e.g. Si. As shown in waveguide device includes two waveguide cores and formed in the same layer as membrane and phononic crystal regions . Waveguide cores and are located between a plurality of slots formed in membrane whereby the slots can act to constrain light and or acoustic waves in the waveguide cores and .

However in contrast to the step index waveguides e.g. devices and which guide light and or acoustic waves by total internal reflection e.g. in waveguide core waveguide can guide light and or acoustic information as a consequence of Bragg reflection through the formation of an optical bandgap.

As shown in if a pump signal Pp is injected into a first waveguide at a frequency of less than about 8 GHz a conversion efficiency is minimal even impaired as shown in region with no interaction occurring with the probe beam Pr e.g. Pr remains flat . In an embodiment a transmission of energy in the pump signal Pp can be of an ultra wideband stimulated Mach wave emission e.g. across a frequency range of 2 11 GHz. Further the pump signal Pp can be constrained in the first waveguide based upon Bragg reflection occurring at the phononic crystal regions . Effectively the phononic crystal regions act to confine the Pp signal as a function of electrorestrictive forces generated as a result of an optical mode of the Pp signal interacting with the phononic crystal regions e.g. a phononic defect mode. Owing to the Mach wave emission at a frequency of less than about 8 GHz e.g. a frequency below a phononic bandgap any acoustic waves generated at the first waveguide propagate freely across all of the phononic crystal regions .

However as shown in when the pump signal Pp is injected into the first waveguide at a frequency of the phononic bandgap e.g. of about 8 9.5 GHz as shown e.g. in region any information in the pump signal Pp can be resonantly coupled to the probe beam Pr injected into the second waveguide . Hence when operating at a phononic bandgap frequency the waveguide device can operate as a tunable reflector for sound i.e. a phonic bandgap reflector while simultaneously conveying signal Pp along the first waveguide . The waveguide device can effect efficient transfer as shown in of energy over a narrow bandwidth s .

As will be understood by those skilled in the art one possible output of a system such as that described above is a phase modulated version of the probe beam. The phase modulation may be understood in one sense as resulting from changes in the refractive index created by the action of the pump radiation. This behavior can be readily utilized to create e.g. an optical filter.

Other possible applications utilize an optical frequency comb created by cascaded Brillouin processes i.e. by Stokes or anti Stokes shifts that are repeated one two three or more times. This may occur for example in a Brillouin laser in which the free spectral range of the resonant cavity is divisible by the phonon frequency. Because the resulting comb lines are coherent it might be possible to use such a cascaded process to generate optical pulses.

In other possible applications the probe beam can be split and simultaneously injected into a plurality of optical waveguides all of which traverse phononic resonators and all of which are acoustically coupled via the suspended membrane. A pump beam injected into one or more designated driver waveguides generates phonons that propagate through the membrane and locally excite the resonators traversed by the respective optical waveguides at different times determined by the respective phononic propagation delays. The resulting frequency or phase modulation of optical pulses injected via the probe beam can be utilized to operate such an arrangement as an optical pulse delay circuit or an optical pulse shaper.

In Brillouin laser applications it may be possible to actively mode lock the laser by modulating the pump beam at a desired pulse frequency that is compatible e.g. with a harmonic of the optical cavity round trip time and of the phononic cavity round trip time.

To facilitate understanding of the various embodiments presented herein coupled wave equations are developed which describe the nonlinear wave mixing processes which can occur in a waveguide device and further derive functional form of the various asymmetric line shapes observed through heterodyne pump probe experiments. By utilizing the analytically derived line shapes quantitative analyses of the experimental signatures are performed to determine the magnitude of the Brillouin nonlinear coefficient.

As previously described a function of the various geometries of waveguide devices can facilitate mutually incoherent pump and probe beams being coupled into the Brillouin waveguide. A pump beam can be produced by intensity modulation of a monochromatic laser line. Modulation at frequency generates a pump beam comprising two frequencies and with corresponding wave amplitudes Aand A where . A probe beam can comprise of a monochromatic wave having a disparate wavelength to the pump beam with wave amplitude Aand frequency . Nonlinear wave mixing processes involving A Aand Agenerate Stokes and anti Stokes fields at frequencies and with a Stokes wave amplitude Aand an anti Stokes wave amplitude Arespectively. The wave amplitudes Aand Acan be measured through heterodyne detection to produce the line shapes previously discussed e.g. with reference to . For simplicity it can be assumed that both pump and probe waves are coupled to transverse electric like TE like waveguide modes. Owing to the Stokes and anti Stokes waves having zero amplitude at the entrance to waveguide the coupled wave equations for Stokes and anti Stokes wave growth can to first order be expressed as 

where P 2 A A A and and are the third order nonlinear coefficients for stimulated Brillouin scattering SBS and non degenerate four wave mixing FWM respectively. In addition is the fifth order nonlinear coefficient which results from two photon absorption TPA induced by free carrier absorption and refractive index changes imparted by waves A Aand A. In the above Eqns 1a and 1b the two photon absorption TPA induced attenuation of Aand Ahas been neglected since in this small signal limit these terms are much smaller than the source terms of Eqn. 1a and Eqn. 1b.

It is assumed that the Brillouin nonlinearity is described by a single oscillator yielding a Lorentzian line shape of the form 

where is the resonant frequency of the mmode Q indicates the quality factor of the phonon resonator and G 2 is the Brillouin gain. Solving for time harmonically modulated TPA induced free carrier generation rate and using the carrier rate equation to solve for 

where M and V are constants with positive value and is the free carrier lifetime. It is to be noted that is well approximated as a frequency independent constant which can be computed from the waveguide geometry and a nonlinear coefficient of Si. Thus in an aspect FWM is non dispersive while Brillouin induced couplings and the free carrier induced nonlinear couplings can have frequency dependent responses in the example frequency sweeping range e.g. 1 18 GHz .

To remain consistent with the experimental arrangements it is to be noted that the FWM and free carrier effect occur through the waveguide entire waveguide length e.g. a length of 4.9 mm while the Brillouin active interaction length is shorter than the total waveguide length e.g. a length of 2.6 mm . In such a scenario the optical power of the Stokes field obtained by solving Eqn. 1a is 2 Eqn. 4

where C is a constant Pindicates the optical power of kfield and Land Lare the interaction lengths of SBS and the rest nonlinear responses respectively. Eqn. 4 consists of two terms one for Brillouin scattering and another which includes both non degenerate four wave mixing FWM and free carrier effects. The signal from FWM and free carrier effect is referred to as the reference signal. In the absence of the Brillouin nonlinearities e.g. for large detuning from a Brillouin resonance the free carrier and FWM contributions to the Stokes sideband can be described by 2 Eqn. 5

Since the free carrier effects engender a slow variation across a frequency envelope can be treated as a constant in the vicinity of a single Brillouin resonance e.g. for frequency spans of less than 100 MHz . Further owing to from Eqn. 3 the reference signals for Stokes and anti Stokes are expected to differ from each other when is comparable with 1 .

By fitting Eqn. 4 to the experimentally obtained Stokes and anti Stokes Brillouin scattering signals as shown in it is possible to estimate the Brillouin gain G 2 . The normalized fitting function g gcan be derived from Eqns. 4 and 5 to form 

where D GL 2L 2 P is the relative strength of the Brillouin scattering effect relative to the reference nonlinear responses. Owing to and being complex functions the relative phase between the Brillouin scattering signal and background FWM FC nonlinear responses is defined as bin Eqn. 6. The proportionality to P Pand Pas well as the constant C in Eqns. 4 and 5 are normalized out of Eqn. 6.

It is to be noted that owing to the frequency dependent free carrier effect different resonant modes are normalized by different nonlinear backgrounds. In the previously described experiments it was observed that at high frequency 15 GHz the amplitude of the reference signal converges to 2 indicating 2 P. The reference signal spectrum can be measured to facilitate obtaining the ration 2 P 2 . By utilizing established methods for computing 2 based on well known values for the Kerr nonlinearities of crystalline Si an estimate of the Brillouin gain G can be determined according to the following 

It is to be noted that the propagation losses in Eqns. 1a and 1b do not appear in Eqn. 7 as losses do not alter the final functional form of the derived line shape in the small signal limit.

The magnitude of produced by the Si waveguide was computed using an accepted Kerr coefficient of n 4.5 10 m W for Si. Employing a full vectorial method for computing according to conventional methodology 2 is computed to be 188 1 W m for TOPROW waveguides with SiNmembrane widths of d 1.8 2.8 3.8 m WIDTH D of . As the SiNwidth was reduced to d 0.8 m the close proximity of the lateral nitride boundary increases the modal confinement yielding of 214 1 W m .

At as a function of the first lightwave passing through the waveguide a combination of electrostrictive and radiation pressure induced boundary forces can establish phononic activity in the phononic resonators.

At a phonon in the phononic resonator can propagate out in a direction substantially transverse to the waveguide optical direction. As the phonon propagates out at a certain distance the phonon is incident upon a slot wall which can cause the phonon to be reflected back to the waveguide thereby generating one or more optical modes in the phononic resonator whereby the optical mode can be considered a form of vibration in the phononic resonator.
