abstract: A system and method for connecting virtual space entities are disclosed. Information regarding virtual space entities may be obtained. The obtained information may include information indicating one or more actions and/or effects associated with the virtual space entities. The associated effects may indicate the associated actions may be caused in the virtual space by actions of other virtual space entities. Users may be enabled to specify action connections between actions of different virtual space entities. The user specified action connections may provide causal relationships between a first action and a first effect associated with a second action. Occurrence of the first action within a given instance of virtual space may be determined. Based on the user specified action connections, the first effect may be executed to cause the second action to be performed in the virtual space.

This disclosure relates to facilitating users to dynamically connecting virtual space entities present in an instance of the virtual space.

In conventional virtual space systems interactions between virtual space objects and or characters are typically defined by providers of the virtual space systems. In those systems such interactions are typically programmed at configuration stages of the systems e.g. during a development of virtual space software. For example a ball may be programmed to roll in the virtual space in response to physical force applied by a character s kicking. In those systems reconfigurations of such interactions are often tedious and time consuming. Typically to introduce new or modify existing interactions between virtual space objects and or characters providers of the virtual space systems will need to reprogram the virtual space systems which usually involves recompiling and re releasing virtual space software. Moreover in those systems the users do not have controls on how the game characters and or objects should interact with one another at runtime of the virtual space system.

One aspect of the disclosure relates to facilitating users to dynamically specify action connections between virtual space entities and executing actions in the virtual space based on the user specified action connections. The users may be enabled to specify such action connections in an instance of the virtual space e.g. through a user interface. At runtime of the virtual space system occurrence of the actions specified in the action connections may be detected. Effects of the detected actions may be executed in the virtual space to cause other actions to be executed in the virtual space as specified by the action connections. Accordingly users may be enabled to dynamically define and initiate interactions between virtual space entities at runtime of the virtual space system. This allows the users to customize interactions between virtual space entities without having the virtual space system reconfigured as required by the conventional virtual space systems.

In some implementations a system configured to connect virtual space entities may include a server. The server may operate in a client server architecture with one or more client computing platforms. The client computing platforms may be associated with the users of the virtual space. The server may be configured to execute one or more of a virtual space entity module a connection module a connection interface module an effect module and or other modules.

The virtual space entity module may be configured to register information regarding individual entities present in a given instance of the virtual space. In some implementations for such registrations the virtual space entity module may be configured to monitor virtual space and detect presence of virtual space entities in the given instance of the virtual space. The registered information regarding the virtual space entities may include information indicating actions effects and or other information associated with the virtual space entities. Actions associated with virtual space entities may be programmed at a configuration stage of the virtual space system by provider administrator moderator and or any other entities related to the virtual space. As used herein the term action may refer to something done or performed by to or on a virtual space entity within the virtual space. An action may be reflected in a change between states an event and or other phenomena. An action may be active e.g. performed by the virtual space entity passive e.g. performed on the virtual space entity and or some combination of active and passive. An effect associated with a virtual space entity may indicate causation such that the execution of the effect may cause the virtual space entity to perform an action associated with the virtual space entity. Such effect may be produced by one or more actions performed by other virtual space entities.

The connection module may be configured to obtain user specified action connections between virtual space entities and to register the obtained user specified action connections. The obtained action connections may provide causal relationships between actions associated with individual virtual space entities. An action connection may provide a causal relationship between a first action associated with a first virtual space entity and a first effect associated with a second virtual space entity. In some examples to provide such a causal relationship the user specified action connection may establish a link between the first action and the first effect. As such the action connection may indicate that upon occurrence of the first action by the first virtual space entity the first effect may be executed to cause the second virtual space entity to perform an action.

The connection interface module may be configured to generate user interfaces that facilitate the users to specify action connections in the virtual space. Such user interfaces may be presented to the user on an electronic display associated with the computing platform. In some implementations the connection interface module may be configured to generate a user interface based on user selection of a virtual space entity. In some implementations the connection interface module may be configured to determine whether a user selected action can be connected with another action in the virtual space also selected by the user. In some implementations the connection interface module may be configured to determine that a user selected action may not be connected with another user selected action and generate information in the user interface to indicate so.

The effect module may be configured to generate commands for effects specified in the user specified action connections to be executed in the virtual space. For generating such commands the effect module may be configured to receive information indicating one or more actions have occurred in the virtual space. Responsive to receiving such information the effect module may be configured to compare the actions indicated by the received information with actions specified in the action connections. Responsive to detections of occurrences of action specified in the action connections the effect module may be configured to generate commands for the effects of the detected actions to be executed in the virtual space as indicated by the action connections. In some implementations the effect module may be configured to detect occurrences and execute such effects recursively. In some implementations for such recursive detection and execution of effects the effect module may be configured to monitor actions caused by detected action in a given instance of the virtual space determine whether these caused actions may produce effects to cause other actions in the instance of the virtual space as specified in the action connections execute the effects of these caused action if any and repeat this detection determination and execution of effects until there is no more effect detected to cause an action to be executed in the given instance of the virtual space as specified in the action connections. In this fashion the effect module may effectuate a chain of action causations as a result of occurrence of one or more actions detected in the instance of the virtual space. In some implementations the effect module may be configured to effectuate transmission of the generated commands to a virtual space server for execution of the effects by a space module provided by the virtual space server.

These and other objects features and characteristics of the present invention as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structure and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings all of which form a part of this specification wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures. It is to be expressly understood however that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. As used in the specification and in the claims the singular form of a an and the include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

In some implementations system may include one or more of one or more virtual space servers one or more system servers and or other components. The virtual space server may be configured to communicate with one or more client computing platforms according to a client server architecture to provide the virtual space to users via the client computing platforms . The system server may be configured to interface with virtual space server to supplement the functionality provided to the users with respect to the virtual space. For example system server may interface with virtual space server via one or more application programming interfaces.

The system server may be configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The computer program modules may include one or more of a virtual space entity module a connection module a connection interface module an effect module and or other modules.

The virtual space entity module may be configured to register information regarding individual entities present in an instance of a virtual space which may be for example implemented by a space module provided by the virtual space server . The instance of the virtual space may reflect a state of the virtual space. The space module provided by the virtual space sever may determine state information for the instance of the virtual space. State information may include information about the state of the virtual space such as without limitation position information of one or more objects topography information object status shape information battle information score information user or character progress information user inventory information progress information for one or more activities or actions view information describing a view of the virtual space and or other information that describes the state of the virtual space.

The instance of the virtual space may comprise a simulated space that is accessible by users via clients e.g. client computing platforms that present the views of the virtual space to a user. The simulated space may have a topography express ongoing real time interaction by one or more users and or include one or more objects positioned within the topography that are capable of locomotion within the topography. In some instances the topography may be a 2 dimensional topography. In other instances the topography may be a 3 dimensional topography. The topography may include dimensions of the space and or surface features of a surface or objects that are native to the space. In some instances the topography may describe a surface e.g. a ground surface that runs through at least a substantial portion of the space. In some instances the topography may describe a volume with one or more bodies positioned therein e.g. a simulation of gravity deprived space with one or more celestial bodies positioned therein . The instance executed by the computer modules may be synchronous asynchronous and or semi synchronous.

The above description of the views of the virtual space determined from the instance executed by space module is not intended to be limiting. The virtual space may be presented in a more limited or richer manner. For example views of the virtual space may be selected from a limited set of graphics depicting an event in a given place within the virtual space. The views may include additional content e.g. text audio pre stored video content and or other content that describes particulars of the current state of the place beyond the relatively generic graphics. For example a view may include a generic battle graphic with a textual description of the opponents to be confronted. Other representations of individual places within the virtual space are contemplated.

Within the instance of the virtual space executed by space module users may control customize and or interact with virtual space entities such as but not limited to characters objects simulated physical phenomena e.g. wind rain earthquakes and or other phenomena and or other virtual space entities within the virtual space. The virtual space entity s may move through and interact with other virtual space entities e.g. non user characters in the virtual space other objects in the virtual space . The virtual space entity s controlled by and or associated with a given user may be created and or customized by the given user. The user may have an inventory of virtual goods and or currency that the user can use e.g. by manipulation of a user character or other user controlled element and or other items within the virtual space.

The users may participate in the instance of the virtual space by inputting commands through client computing platforms . The commands may specify virtual space maneuvers and or other user interactions with the virtual space. The user specified virtual space maneuvers may direct one or more virtual space entities to perform actions and interact with one another in the virtual space. The commands may be executed in the virtual space such that user specified virtual space maneuvers may be effectuated in the virtual space.

To facilitate such virtual space maneuvers requested by the users the provider administrator moderator and or any other entities related to the virtual space may configure individual virtual space entities with programming rules representing actions at a programming stage of the system . As used herein the term action may refer to something done or performed by to or on a virtual space entity within the virtual space. An action may be reflected in a change between states an event and or other phenomena. An action may be active e.g. performed by the virtual space entity passive e.g. performed on the virtual space entity and or some combination of active and passive. By way of non limiting examples a pressure plate may be configured with programming rules representing two actions the pressure plate may perform in the virtual space pressing downwards or releasing upwards a cannon may be configured to perform one of three actions in the virtual space launching confetti launching fireworks or launching both confetti and fireworks and so on.

A programmed action may produce one or more effects in the virtual space. The produced effects may be associated with individual virtual space entities. An individual virtual space entity may be configured to be associated with one or more effects that cause the virtual space entity to perform an action associated with the virtual space entity. As used herein such an effect will be referenced as a causal effect which causes an action to be executed in the virtual space. For example the cannon may be configured to be associated with a causal effect that causes the cannon to launch fireworks. Other causal effects associated with the cannon may include an effect that causes the cannon to launch confetti and an effect that causes the cannon to launch both the confetti and fireworks.

In some implementations the virtual space entity module may be configured to monitor the virtual space and detect presence of virtual space entities in a given instance of the virtual space. For example the virtual space entity module may be configured to obtain state information from the virtual space sever e.g. via the space module and detect presence of one or more virtual space entities in a given instance of the virtual space. For example a user may place a cannon in a location within the virtual space e.g. the user selects a cannon from a palette and drops the cannon onto the virtual space location in a given instance of the virtual space. In that example the virtual space entity module detects the presence of the cannon in the instance of the virtual space by determining that the obtained state information about the virtual space indicating that the cannon is present in the virtual space at that instance.

In those implementations responsive to the detection that one or more virtual space entities are present in a given instance of the virtual space the virtual space entity module may be configured to register information regarding those virtual space entities e.g. in the electronic storage . In some implementations such information may be registered in a file and or database stored in the electronic storage . Such a file and or the database may be accessed by other modules e.g. such as the connection interface module of system via any suitable communication means. In some implementations such information may be registered in memory storage provided by the electronic storage fast access by other modules of the system .

In any case the registered information may include information indicating actions and or effects i.e. the causal effects associated with the virtual space entities present in the instance of the virtual space. For example in a case where it is determined that a cannon and a pressure plate are present in the instance of the virtual space the virtual space entity module may register information regarding the actions and or effects associated with the cannon and the pressure plate. For the cannon the registered information may include information indicating that the cannon is configured to perform one of three actions i.e. launching confetti launching fireworks or launching both the confetti and fireworks and indicating that three causal effects are associated with the cannon i.e. to launch confetti to launch fireworks or to launch both the confetti and fireworks. For the pressure plate the registered information may include information indicating the pressure plate is configured to perform one of two actions i.e. pressing downwards or releasing upwards and indicating that two causal effects are associated with the pressure plate i.e. to be stepped on or to be stepped off.

It should be appreciated that the number of actions and or effects associated with an individual virtual space entity may vary in some other examples. Particularly in some examples it may be desired not to associate a effect with an individual virtual space entity such that the action s of the individual virtual space entity may not be caused by other virtual space actions dynamically. However in those examples such an individual virtual space entity may be configured to perform actions that produce causal effects that may cause other virtual space entities to perform their actions in the virtual space. For example a effect may not be associated with the pressure plate to cause the pressure plate to press downwards or release upwards dynamically in the virtual space e.g. these actions of the pressure plate may be instigated automatically according to a script predetermined by provider administrator moderator and or any other entities related to the virtual space . However the actions of the pressure plate may be configured to produce causal effects to cause other virtual space entities to perform their actions in the virtual space e.g. downward pressing of the pressure plate may cause the cannon to launch fireworks .

Connection module may be configured to obtain user specified action connections between virtual space entities and to register the obtained user specified action connections. In some implementations the obtained user specified action connections may be registered by the connection module in a file and or database stored in the electronic storage and the file and or the database may be accessed by other modules e.g. such as the effect module of system via any suitable communication means. In some implementations such user specified action connections may be registered by the connection module in memory storage provided by the electronic storage for fast access by other modules of the system .

In any case the obtained user specified action connections may provide causal relationships between actions associated with individual virtual space entities. In some examples an action connection may provide a causal relationship between a first action associated with a first virtual space entity and a first effect associated with a second virtual space entity. To provide such a causal relationship in the virtual space the user specified action connection may establish a link between the first action and the first effect i.e. a causal effect.

By way of a non limiting example an action connection between the cannon and pressure plate may be specified by a user and registered. The user specified action connection may provide a causal relationship between a launching action of the cannon and the downward pressing action of the pressure plate. For such a causal relationship the user may specify in the action connection that the downward pressing action of the pressure plate may produce a causal effect to cause the cannon to launch fireworks. Simultaneously or alternatively other user specified action connections may be obtained for example the cannon may also be connected with a pulley to launch fireworks when the pulley pulls backwards the cannon may be connected with a lever to fire confetti when the lever rotates and so on. It should be appreciated that the first action of the first virtual space entity e.g. launching fireworks by the cannon may be connected with one or more actions by other virtual space entities in multiple action connections i.e. the downward pressing by the pressure plate the pulling back by the pulley and so on may all produce the causal effect to cause the cannon to launch the fireworks . will illustrate further details about the user specified action connections.

Connection interface module may be configured to generate interfaces to facilitate users to specify action connections in the virtual space. The user interfaces generated by connection interface module may be presented to the user through electronic displays coupled to or included in the client computing platforms . The generated user interfaces may include one or more control fields. A control field may be configured to receive inputs indicating an entry and or selection of virtual space entity present in an instance of the virtual space. Inputs may be made to the generated user interface separate from any control field. Through the inputs the user may select a first virtual space entity select a first action associated with the first virtual space entity select a second virtual space entity select a first effect i.e. a causal effect associated with the second virtual space entity and connect the first action with the second action by linking the first action with the first effect.

In some implementations the connection interface module may be configured to generate a user interface based on user selection of a virtual space entity. For such generations the connection interface module may be configured to determine e.g. from the registered information regarding a user selected virtual space entity one or more actions associated with the user selected virtual space entity. Information graphical audio and or textual may be generated in the user interface by the connection interface module to present these actions to the users. User input of a selected action may be received by the connection interface module and based on the selected action one or more virtual space entities present in the instant virtual space whose actions may be connected with the user selected action may be determined. Information graphical audio and or textual may be generated in the user interface by the connection interface module to present these virtual space entities to the users. User input of a second selected virtual space entity to be connected with the selected action may be received by the connection interface module from the user and information indicating actions associated with the second selected virtual space entity may be generated in the user interface by the connection interface module . User input of a second selected action may be received and an action connection between the first action and a causal effect that causes the second action by the second virtual space may be established and registered.

In some implementations the connection interface module may be configured to determine whether a user selected action can be connected with another user selected action to form a causal relationship in the virtual space. For example inputs of a user selection of a first action associated with a first virtual space entity and a second action associated with a second virtual space entity may be received from a user interface generated by the connection interface module . The selections may be made by the user through the user interface to specify an action connection between the first action and second action such that the occurrence of the first action will produce a causal effect to cause the second action to be performed by the second virtual space entity. Before sending this user specified action connection to connection module for a registration the connection interface module may be configured to verify whether such an action connection can be established in the virtual space. In some examples the verifications may be done by consulting predetermined virtual space rules. In those examples the predetermined virtual space rules may specify virtual space logic gameplay mechanics and or other rules that dictate interactions between virtual space entities. For instance the virtual space rules may specify criteria for the cannon to be caused to launch fireworks e.g. the cannon may only be set off by a translational motion performed by a virtual space object. Based on such criteria the connection interface module may determine that a user selected downward pressing action by a pressure plate present in a given instance of the virtual space may be connected with the fireworks launching action by the cannon.

In some implementations the connection interface module may be configured to determine that a user selected action may not be connected with another action in the virtual space and generate information in the user interface to indicate so. For example a user may select a rolling action by a roller and the fireworks launching action in the user interface attempting to connect the two actions. The connection interface module may determine e.g. based on the predetermined virtual space rules that the rolling action may not be connected with the firework launching action because the predetermined virtual space rules require the causal effect to cause the firework launching action by the cannon to be produced by a virtual space entity with translational motion not rotational motion.

The effect module may be configured to generate commands for effects as indicated by the user specified action connections to be executed in the virtual space. For generating such commands the effect module may be configured to receive information indicating one or more actions that have occurred in the virtual space. In some implementations the effect module may be configured to receive state information determined by the space module provided by the virtual space server for the instant virtual space. The received state information may include information indicating one or more state changes representing occurrences of actions within the instance of the virtual space. For example the state information for an instance of the virtual space may indicate that the pressure plate has performed a downward pressing action e.g. as indicated by the position change of pressure plate in the instance of the virtual space. In those implementations the effect module may be configured to receive the state information as the state information is pushed to the effect module at a given instance of the virtual space e.g. by the virtual space server via the space module.

Responsive to receiving the information indicating actions within a given instance of the virtual space the effect module may be configured to compare the actions indicated by the received information with actions in the user specified action connections registered by the connection module and to detect occurrences of actions that produces causal effects specified in the action connections. The comparison may be made by matching the actions in the received information with the actions specified in the action connections. In some embodiments this may be done through string matching. Upon a match the effect module may detect that an occurrence of an action specified in the action connection.

Responsive to occurrences of the detected actions the effect module may be configured to generate commands for causal effects corresponding to the detect actions in the action connections to be executed in the virtual space. In some implementations the effect module may simply generate a command instructing the space module to execute the corresponding causal effects. Such a command for example may be executed by the space module on the virtual space server to effectuate actions caused by the effects in the virtual space.

In some implementations the effect module may be configured to detect occurrences and execute effects recursively. In those implementations for such recursive detection and execution of effects the effect module may be configured to monitor caused actions i.e. actions that are caused by occurrences of other actions as specified in the action connections in a given instance of the virtual space and determine whether these caused actions may produce causal effects to cause other actions in the given instance of the virtual space according to the user specified action connections. For example in the case where the downward pressing action was performed by the pressure plate in a given instance of the virtual space the effect module determines that this downward pressing action causes the cannon to launch fireworks as indicated by the user specified action connections. Upon such a determination the effects module may continue to determine whether the fireworks launching action by the cannon may produce causal effect s to cause other actions in the given instance of the virtual space as also indicated by the user specified action connections. If the user specified action connections indicate that the fireworks launching action by the cannon will cause another action in the virtual space the effect module may generate a command to cause that action to be executed in the virtual space. This recursive determination and execution of causal effects may be repeated by the effect module until there is no more occurrence of causal effect in the given instance of the virtual space.

In some implementations the effect module may be configured to effectuate the transmission of the generated commands to virtual space server for execution of the effects by the space module. This may involve invoking network transmission module e.g. a network driver included in the system server and provide the generated command to the transmission module for transmitting the generated command over the network.

The virtual space server the system server client computing platforms and or external resources may be operatively linked via one or more electronic communication links. For example such electronic communication links may be established at least in part via a network such as the Internet and or other networks. It will be appreciated that this is not intended to be limiting and that the scope of this disclosure includes implementations in which servers client computing platforms and or external resources may be operatively linked via some other communication media.

For example server may be implemented by a cloud of computing platforms operating together as server .

Electronic storage may comprise non transitory storage media that electronically stores information. The electronic storage media of electronic storage may include one or both of system storage that is provided integrally i.e. substantially non removable with system server and or removable storage that is removably connectable to server via for example a port e.g. a USB port a firewire port etc. or a drive e.g. a disk drive etc. . Electronic storage may include one or more of optically readable storage media e.g. optical disks etc. magnetically readable storage media e.g. magnetic tape magnetic hard drive floppy drive etc. electrical charge based storage media e.g. EEPROM RAM etc. solid state storage media e.g. flash drive etc. and or other electronically readable storage media. Electronic storage may include one or more virtual storage resources e.g. cloud storage a virtual private network and or other virtual storage resources . Electronic storage may store software algorithms information determined by processor information received from server information received from client computing platforms and or other information that enables server to function as described herein.

Processor s is configured to provide information processing capabilities in server . As such processor may include one or more of a digital processor an analog processor a digital circuit designed to process information an analog circuit designed to process information a state machine and or other mechanisms for electronically processing information. Although processor is shown in as a single entity this is for illustrative purposes only. In some implementations processor may include a plurality of processing units. These processing units may be physically located within the same device or processor may represent processing functionality of a plurality of devices operating in coordination. The processor may be configured to execute modules and or other modules. Processor may be configured to execute modules and or other modules by software hardware firmware some combination of software hardware and or firmware and or other mechanisms for configuring processing capabilities on processor .

This may include one or more physical processors during execution of processor readable instructions the processor readable instructions circuitry hardware storage media or any other components.

The virtual space server may also include one or more processors configured to run programs including a space module that executes and implements instances of the virtual space electronic storage I O subsystem and or any other components.

It should be appreciated that although modules are illustrated in as being implemented within a single processing unit in implementations in which processor includes multiple processing units one or more of modules may be implemented remotely from the other modules. The description of the functionality provided by the different modules described below is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to be limiting as any of modules may provide more or less functionality than is described. For example one or more of modules may be eliminated and some or all of its functionality may be provided by other ones of modules . As another example processor may be configured to execute one or more additional modules that may perform some or all of the functionality attributed below to one of modules .

It should be appreciated that the above description of system is merely illustrated as one example of a system configured to connect virtual space entities in accordance with the disclosure. It should be appreciated that in some examples a localized system may be configured according to a stand alone architecture such that the system configured to connect virtual space entities may be localized. For example the localized system may comprise a processor the same as or similar to the processor e.g. a CPU a graphical processing unit GPU storage memory an I O subsystem and or other components included the localized system . In those examples the CPU may be configured to communicate virtual space state information to the GPU through any suitable wired or wireless communications such as but not limited to a point to point communication link like a data bus included in the localized system . The GPU may be configured to determine representational view information for presenting instances of virtual space on one or more displays coupled to or included in the localized system .

In any case in this example the virtual space entity module may detect the presence of the pressure plate and the cannon in the given instance of the as described above. As shown responsive to such detections the virtual space entity module may obtain information regarding the pressure plate and the cannon present in the given instance of the virtual space. As illustrated the obtained information may include information indicating actions that may be performed by the pressure plate and the cannon in the virtual space and information indicating causal effects associated with the pressure plate and the cannon and or any other information regarding the pressure plate and the cannon . In this example two causal effects are associated with the pressure plate i.e. to cause the pressure plate to be stepped on and to cause the pressure plate to be stepped off. These two causal effects associated with the pressure plate may be linked with the two actions associated with the pressure plate such that when the causal effect to be stepped on occurs in the virtual space the pressure plate will perform the action of pressing downwards and when causal effect to be stepped off occurs in the virtual space the pressure plate will perform the action of releasing upwards. Likewise three causal effects are associated with the cannon which will cause the three actions associated with the cannon to be performed by the cannon in the virtual space. The obtained action and effect information regarding the pressure plate and the cannon may be registered by the virtual space entity module as described above.

As shown in responsive to user s selection of the pressure plate the connection interface module further generates prompts in the user interface to prompt the user to select an action to be initiated by the pressure plate . As illustrated the generated user interface presents action choices based on the registered information regarding the pressure plate to facilitate the user to select an action to be initiated by the pressure plate . In this example as shown the user selects the downward pressing action .

In some embodiments method may be implemented in one or more processing devices e.g. a digital processor an analog processor a digital circuit designed to process information an analog circuit designed to process information a state machine and or other mechanisms for electronically processing information . The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices executing some or all of the operations of method in response to instructions stored electronically on an electronic storage medium. The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices configured through hardware firmware and or software to be specifically designed for execution of one or more of the operations of method .

At operation information indicating one or more actions and or effects associated with a first virtual space entity present in a given instance of the virtual space may be received and registered. An effect associated with a virtual space entity may indicate causation such that the execution of the effect may cause the virtual space entity to perform an action associated with the virtual space entity. An action associated with a virtual space entity may be programmed at a configuration stage of the system and may be performed by the virtual space entity at a runtime of the system. In some implementations operation may be performed a virtual space entity module the same as or similar to the virtual space entity module shown in and described herein .

At operation information indicating one or more actions and or effects associated with a second virtual space entity present in a given instance of the virtual space may be received and registered. In some implementations operation may be performed by a virtual space entity module the same as or similar to the virtual space entity module shown in and described herein .

At operation user selection of the first virtual space entity for a specification of an action connection may be obtained. In some implementations operation may be performed by connection interface module the same as or similar to the connection interface module shown in and described herein .

At operation information indicating actions associated with the first virtual space entity may be provided to the user in response to user selection of the first virtual space entity in operation . In some implementations operation may be performed by connection interface module the same as or similar to the connection interface module shown in and described herein .

At operation selection of a first action associated with the first virtual space entity may be obtained from the user. In some implementations operation may be performed by connection interface module the same as or similar to the connection interface module shown in and described herein .

At operation user selection of the second virtual space entity may be obtained. The user may select the second virtual space entity as an effect produced by the first virtual space entity.

In some embodiments method may be implemented in one or more processing devices e.g. a digital processor an analog processor a digital circuit designed to process information an analog circuit designed to process information a state machine and or other mechanisms for electronically processing information . The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices executing some or all of the operations of method in response to instructions stored electronically on an electronic storage medium. The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices configured through hardware firmware and or software to be specifically designed for execution of one or more of the operations of method .

At operation information indicating one or more actions have occurred in an instance of the virtual space may be received. In some embodiments such information may be received from state information provided by a virtual space server. In some implementations operation may be performed an effect module the same as or similar to the effect module shown in and described herein .

At operation the actions indicated by the information received in operation may be compared with those specified in the user specified action connections. In some implementations operation may be performed an effect module the same as or similar to the effect module shown in and described herein .

At operation occurrence of the first action specified in the action connections may be detected based on the comparison made in operation . In some implementations operation may be performed an effect module the same as or similar to the effect module shown in and described herein .

At operation a command for executing the first effect corresponding to the first action specified in the action connections may be generated. As indicated by the action connections the first effect causes another action to be executed in the virtual space. In some implementations operation may be performed an effect module the same as or similar to the effect module shown in and described herein .

At operation a determination whether the action caused in the operation may have an effect as specified by the action connections is made. This may involving determining whether the caused action is also specified in the action connections to have an effect to cause another action. In the case where it is determined that the caused action does not have such an effect specified in the action connections the method proceed to end. In the case where it is determined that the caused action does have such an effect specified the action connections the method proceed to operation .

At operation a command for executing the effect corresponding to the caused action specified in the action connections is generated. The effect indicates that another action may be executed as a result of the occurrence of the caused action. Subsequently the method repeats operation and until there is no more effect to be executed responsive to the action caused the operation .
