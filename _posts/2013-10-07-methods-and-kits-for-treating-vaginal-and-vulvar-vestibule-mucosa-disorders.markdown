The vulvar vestibule or vulval vestibule is located between the labia minora. The orifice of the urinary tract i.e. the urethral orifice opens into it. The vaginal orifice is behind the vestibule. Its edge is marked by Hart s Line. Hart s Line is the line of change from vulvar skin to the smoother mucosa of the vulva.

Pain at the vulvar vestibule and at the labia minora is relatively common. A study by the University of Michigan Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease January 2004 Volume 8 Issue 1 pp 48 57 found that about 28 of women have experienced vulvar vestibular pain and about 8 had the pain in the last 6 months. Some problems could also be due to the vaginal and vulvar dryness.

The human vagina is an elastic muscular canal that extends from the cervix to the vulva. The internal lining of the vagina consists of stratified squamous epithelium and beneath this lining is a layer of smooth muscle which may contract during sexual intercourse and when giving birth.

The vagina is the connection between the superficial vulva to the cervix of the deep uterus. After menopause the body produces less estrogen which causes the vaginal walls to thin out significantly. Some women have severe pain during sexual intercourse or tampon use severe pain while biking exercising or wearing tightly fitting clothing redness and burning stinging in the vestibular area and vaginal area and a frequent urge to urinate.

This pain could be due to vulvar and vaginal atrophy and or vulvar vestibulitis syndrome VVS which is a vaginal condition in which the skin and mucous secreting glands known as lesser vestibular glands in the skin become inflamed. This can affect the entire vaginal opening but predominantly presents in the lower portion. Women of all ages and all levels of sexual activity can experience this uncomfortable condition. The exact cause of vulvar vestibulitis syndrome remains unknown but researchers continue to work toward gaining more insight into the condition.

Certain factors have been identified as being associated with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome. They include chronic yeast infections human papilloma virus chronic bacterial infections pH imbalance in the vagina acid based and long term use of irritants and chemicals like spermicides lubricants soaps and detergents .

Others chronic inflammatory pathologies that led to dysuria pain on urination and dyspareunia pain during intercourse could also be cited like sclero atrophic lichen that is a chronic inflammatory nature of the anogenital area affecting predominatly women and that is present with genital and extragenital manifestations and as a consequence vulvar region becomes atrophic.

Treatment of all these pathologies often involves steroidal ointments that are topically applied and decrease redness and discomfort. Other options include trichloracetic acid which works by destroying irritated skin and encouraging the growth of healthy skin injections of interferon which helps to increase the body s natural reaction to infection and in some cases surgery either standard or laser to remove specific areas of affected skin. In some cases a local or sytemic hormonal treatment could also be associated.

The present inventors have surprisingly observed that administration by injection of a hyaluronic acid composition could be used to treat vaginal vulvar and or vulvar vestibule mucosa disorders.

In embodiments a method of treating a vaginal vulvar minora lips or vulvar vestibule mucosa disorder comprises administering by injection a composition comprising a hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof to the vagina vulvar minora lips or vulvar vestibule of an individual that has the disorder to treat the disorder.

A method of treating a vaginal or vulvar lips or vulvar vestibule mucosa disorder comprises injecting a composition comprising a hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof into the vagina or vulvar vestibule of an individual that has the disorder to treat the disorder. The individual may be a human or non human animal. The individual may be female. However the individual may be a non biological female having a vagina and or vulvar vestibule. The method may be used to treat vaginal atrophy or vulvar vestibulitis syndrome among other vulvovaginal mucosa disorders.

The method may be used to treat chronic inflammatory pathologies that led to dysuria pain on urination and dyspareunia pain during intercourse among other sclero atrophic lichen.

Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide constituted of repeated disaccharide units of glucuronic acid and N acetyl glucosamine. Unless context dictates otherwise hyaluronic acid refers to hyaluronic acid and or a salt thereof. The hyaluronic acid may be crosslinked or not crosslinked or substituted or not substituted. Hyaluronic acids may be used alone or in combination such as in a mixture of hyaluronic acids. A mixture of hyaluronic acids may include a plurality of hyaluronic acids salts thereof or any combination thereof.

In embodiments the hyaluronic acid composition is administered by injection. The composition may be administered by one or more injections. The injections may be made into the tissue of the vagina or vulvar vestibule. For example the composition may be injected by one or more intramucosal injections. Concerning the vaginal mucosa the injection may be performed in the posterior lower part of the vagina. Injection of the hyaluronic acid composition may be performed using one or more conventional syringes that contain the hyaluronic acid composition or by a multipuncture technique. The multipuncture technique involves a series of injections of small quantities in an area such that the injections are sufficiently close together to avoid irregularity or empty space

Regarding the intravaginal injections the injections should be performed in the lateral and posterior walls between 10 and 15 injection sites using the multipuncture technique in an area 2 ou 3 cm from the vagina entry in the lamina propria. The injections must be superficial about 1 to 2 mm deep into the mucosa using 30G1 2 needle in a total amount of 0.5 to 0.8 ml of hyaluronic acid composition.

Regarding the vestibule injections the vestibule area is injected using the multipuncture technique. In embodiments a total amount of 0.3 ml of the hyaluronic composition is injected using 30G1 2 needle.

In embodiments the hyaluronic acid composition is administered in an effective amount to treat the vulvovaginal mucosal disorder. The composition may be administered in a single treatment or a series of treatments

Function of the dryness and severity of the disorder the injections should be repeated one three or six months after the first one injection and each year in maintenance regimen.

In embodiments the composition is in the form of a gel. For example the gel may be an injectable hydrogel.

In embodiments the composition comprises a crosslinked hyaluronic acid and or salt thereof alone or in a mixture.

In embodiments the composition comprises a substituted or unsubstituted hyaluronic acid and or salt thereof alone or in a mixture.

As an example sodium hyaluronate exhibits particularly advantageous properties due to its high operating recoil in intradermal injection and also has excellent rheological properties.

The polysaccharide chains can be characterized by their molecular weight MW which is the average molecular weight of the polysaccharide chains and is measured in Daltons Da .

In embodiments the hyaluronic acid is from 0.2 to 5 by weight of the composition. In embodiments the concentration of hyaluronic acid in the composition is from 2 mg g to 50 mg g.

The degree of crosslinking can be controlled by changing several factors including the molecular weight of the hyaluronic acid its concentration in the reaction mixture and the polymer crosslinking agent ratio.

Numerous substances can be used to crosslink hyaluronic acid including but not limited to formaldehyde epoxides polyaziridyl compounds divinyl sulfone and others.

In embodiments the hyaluronic acid is the co crosslinked hyaluronic acid as described in WO2000 046253 and counterpart U.S. Pat. No. 7 385 052 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

In embodiments the hyaluronic acid is a monophasic mixture of hyaluronic acid as described in WO2009 071697 and counterpart U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010 0303873 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

In embodiments the hyaluronic acid composition is a monophasic mixture of hyaluronic acid as described in WO2004 092222 and counterpart U.S. Pat. No. 7 741 476 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

In embodiments the hyaluronic acid composition comprises a substituted hyaluronic acid. Exemplary substituted hyaluronic acids are described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 692 511 entitled Process for the simultaneous substitution and crosslinking of a polysaccharide via its hydroxyl functional groups filed on Dec. 3 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Crosslinked hyaluronic acid was used to treat vulvovaginal atrophy. 7 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age of enrolled patients was 54.1 years and their median BMI was 24.5. They had signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy and had not had any hormone replacement therapy. All symptoms such as vaginal dryness dyspareunia itching and chafing irritation were evaluated by a self assessed score 0 to 10 .

Atrophy was evaluated by a clinical score 0 absent to 4 severe . Vaginal pH and Maturation Index were measured and compared.

0.5 0.8 ml of crosslinked hyaluronic acid 19 mg ml that contains mannitol in order to delay hyaluronic acid degradation was used per patient.

10 12 injection sites were performed by intramucosal injection into the inferior posterior vagina of each patient. Prior topical anesthesia with 2.5 lidocaine cream was performed on each patient. Scheduled follow up was at 1 T1 3 T2 6 T3 and 12 T4 months.

The results are the following on vaginal symptoms dryness and dyspareunia significantly improved for 7 patients in a rapid and sustained manner 

Clinical impression of a steadily improved mucosal trophism and overall doctor satisfaction was high 7.2 10 score at 3 months .

Moreover no significant change in mucosal cytology and biology were induced by hyaluronic acid injections as determined at the 3 month follow up T2 .
