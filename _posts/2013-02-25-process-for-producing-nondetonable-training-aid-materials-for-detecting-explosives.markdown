title: Process for producing non-detonable training aid materials for detecting explosives
abstract: A method for manufacturing training aid materials for detecting homemade explosives includes spreading an explosive powder on a porous surface, storing the surface in a container that facilitates sublimation of the explosive powder such that the explosive powder redeposits onto the surface and into the pores over a period of time, and removing the surface from the container after the period of time to yield training aid materials. An additional method includes preparing a dilute solution of an explosive reaction mixture, and depositing the dilute solution on a surface prior to formation of an explosive product by the explosive reaction mixture. The surface is stored in a contain that facilitates formation of the explosive product, and removed after a period of time and cleaned to remove unreacted precursors to yield training aid materials.

This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 709 389 filed on Oct. 4 2012 the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The subject matter of this application was made with government support under contract number HSHQDC 11 C 00005 awarded by the Department of Homeland Security. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Example embodiments generally relate to producing non detonable explosive samples and more particularly to producing such samples for use as training aids.

Non detonable training aid materials have been developed for allowing training of explosives detection dogs EDD dolphins or other living or non living entities that can detect presence of explosives through emitted vapors. The training aid materials desirably exude the same odor as bulk quantities of real explosives but lack the detonable properties of real explosives and are otherwise safe to handle. Furthermore the training aid materials can preferably produce vapors that exude the odor for at least a specific period of time after opening the package e.g. 2 hours . Such training aid materials have been developed for peroxide based homemade explosives HME allowing for training EDDs to detect such explosives in various environments.

Some training aid materials are formed by coating materials with layers of the explosive molecules as dissolved in a solvent. These materials can similarly produce off odors however due to addition of the solvent.

Accordingly some example embodiments may allow production of non detonable training aid materials with no off odor caused by mixing with solvents or other substances. In one embodiment a porous surface of a training aid material can be covered with an explosive powder and the explosive powder can be allowed to distribute throughout the surface and pores by a sublimation process. For example a pure explosive powder is synthesized and spread to cover a glass microfiber filter. The filter is then stored so as to allow the sublimation process this can include storage in a container that has properties to facilitate the sublimation. When the filters are removed from storage they can emit vapor of the explosive at a rate comparable to large amounts of the explosive powder and can thus be used as training aids for vapor detectors such as explosives detection dogs.

In additional embodiments an explosive reaction mixture can be produced and added to an inert matrix such as diatomaceous earth DE powder before a reaction occurs in the mixture. The amount of mixture used can be substantially low to prevent the formulation from being detonable. In any case using the explosive reaction mixtures in forming the training aids provides for emission of more accurate odor vapor to facilitate improved training of explosive vapor detectors.

Some example embodiments now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some but not all example embodiments are shown. Indeed the examples described and pictured herein should not be construed as being limiting as to the scope applicability or configuration of the present disclosure. Rather these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.

Some example embodiments may enable manufacturing of training aid materials for detecting explosives. For example the training aid materials can be non detonable while exuding similar vapors at similar rates as detonable equivalents. Construction of the training aid materials as provided herein can use pure explosive powders to mitigate off odors e.g. odors other than of the explosive or a training aid therefore itself typically caused by blending with solvents or other chemicals. In specific examples explosive powders can be stored in a container to allow sublimation of the powder over and into a porous surface. The surface can then exude vapors with properties of the explosive powder to facilitate olfactory or other vapor based detection. In other examples an explosive reaction mixture can cover a porous surface prior to formation of the explosive and can be subsequently stored until reaction occurs to form the explosive such that the surface can exude the explosive vapors. In both cases the amount of explosive powder or product used can be sufficiently small or otherwise diluted such that the explosive becomes non detonable and can thus be used as a training aid for explosive vapor detectors such as explosives detecting dogs EDD .

Referring to methodologies that can be utilized in accordance with various aspects described herein are illustrated. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodology is not limited by the order of acts as some acts can in accordance with one or more aspects occur in different orders and or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as in a state diagram. Moreover not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more aspects.

At operation the surface can be stored in a container that facilitates sublimation of the explosive powder over the surface and into the surface pores over a period of time. In one example while stored in the container the sublimation process causes the explosive powder to redeposit onto and or into the surface e.g. the glass microfiber filter DE etc. . For example the container can be multiple layers of aluminum foil multiple stackable aluminum dishes or dishes of other materials one or more glass jars which can have substantially air tight lids etc. or substantially any container that allows the sublimation to occur. In one example the container can have a substantially similar diameter as the surface and or similar to a length of the surface where the surface is not circular . Moreover it is to be appreciated that multiple surfaces can be stored in a single container in some examples.

At operation the surface can be removed from the container after the period of time. Thus the explosive powder can have been redeposited onto the surface at this time as described. Though the amount of explosive powder used in this process is significantly less than that required to construct an explosive device the surface can exude vapors of the explosive powder at a rate that is at least comparable to an amount of explosive powder used in an explosive device. Example test scenarios are described below that show this property of training aid materials constructed according to this method. The removed surface can be used as the manufactured training aid material or can otherwise be used in constructing a training aid for the explosive powder. In this regard a non detonable explosive device training aid is constructed without using solvents or other products that can cause off odors.

In one specific example an amount of neat triacetone triperoxide TATP powder equaling approximately 5 15 mass loading can be gently spread to cover the surface of a glass microfiber filter at operation . The filter can then be tightly wrapped between two aluminum foil layers and allowed to stand for 12 or more hours before use at operation . Alternatively multiple filters are made at operation by spreading the TATP on each filter and then at operation stacking the filters on top of each other and storing the stack in a tight fitting container such as in a glass jar or between two aluminum dishes with similar diameter for filter circles or tightly foil wrapped for long filter strips. In any case the majority of sublimed TATP is forced to redeposit onto and into the filters while stored thus providing a training aid material with a small amount of TATP spread over a large surface area. When unwrapped these TATP loaded filters can emit TATP vapor at a rate comparable to or much greater than that from a larger amounts of neat TATP powder as described further herein.

At operation the TATP and inert porous matrix can be mixed in the container and allowed to stand for a period of time. The mixing can be performed using substantially any mixer suitable for mixing powders. Moreover the period of time for storing the mixture can be sufficient to allow sublimation of the TATP over the inert porous matrix.

At operation the mixture is removed from the container after the period of time. As described the TATP is thus redeposited over the inert porous matrix. The mixture can exude vapors at a rate at least as high as explosive amounts of TATP without being detonable itself. Thus the removed mixture can be used as the manufactured training aid material or can otherwise be used in constructing a training aid for the explosive powder. In this regard a non detonable explosive device training aid is constructed without using solvents or other products that can cause off odors.

In a specific example enough neat TATP powder is added to an inert high purity high surface area matrix such as a United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary USP NF grade DE powder to give approximately 9 TATP mass loading at operation . The glass jar containing the mixture is briefly dry mixed using a wiggle bug and the mixture is stored at least 12 h before use at operation . Batch mixtures e.g. 4 g P300 0.4 g TATP or single training aid mixtures 0.5 g P300 0.05 g TATP give similar emission rates that are comparable to that measured from a much larger amount of neat TATP and thus batches can be constructed according to this method. The mixture is removed at operation and can be used to produce training aid materials.

In either construction of or or other constructions using TATP powders it is to be appreciated that the TATP powder used can be a neat TATP powder formed using the following process or a similar process or otherwise acquired. In one example of making neat TATP powder for use in constructing training aids 34 g of 35 hydrogen peroxide is diluted to 31 by the addition of 5 g water. 20 mL acetone is added to the hydrogen peroxide and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath to below 10 C. 1 mL concentrated 36 hydrochloric acid is added dropwise to the acetone peroxide solution at a rate as to maintain a reaction temperature at or below 10 C. Stirring is maintained throughout the acid addition. At the end of the addition stirring is continued while the reaction mixture is kept in the ice bath for about 3 hours and then allowed to slowly warm to room temperature overnight as the ice melted. The TATP product a fine white powder is collected by vacuum filtration and washed with several portions of water then a weak 2 10 aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate until the filtrate is no longer acidic then more water until the filtrate is essentially neutral pH 7 . The solid product can be dried by pulling air through it while it is contained in the vacuum filter funnel resulting in the neat TATP powder that can be used to construct the training aid materials as described. It is to be appreciated that other amounts of peroxide water acetone hydrochloric acid etc. and or types of materials can be used so long as TATP powder is produced without solvents or other chemicals that may produce off odors.

In a specific example results from example testing of training aids manufactured using processes similar to those described are shown in the below table. Even training aids that had been used for canine testing still emitted TATP vapor at a rate comparable to freshly prepared unused training aids.

Moreover in a specific example certain testing yielded that TATP loaded filters or DE powder burned vigorously but significantly weaker than neat TATP in flame tests neither showed detonation tendencies in the flame tests. Preliminary impact test results indicated that neither filters nor DE powders were initiated by the drop of a 5.640 kg weight from a height of 2.6 onto a 0.25 diameter surface. In an additional example third party testing performed in accordance with the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods Manual of Tests and Criteria Test 3 a 1 for impact sensitivity and Test 3 b i for friction sensitivity confirm that example TATP training aids formulated using similar processes as described above have been sufficiently desensitized as not to fall under the dangerous goods shipping requirements. Criteria for passing the impact and friction tests are respectively an Hdistance of greater than 10 cm 3.94 inches and a limiting load of greater than or equal to 80N. His height at which 5 out of 10 trials result in a positive test. Results of example tests for training aid materials constructed using similar processes as described above are shown in the following table.

In this testing example one gram of 9 TATP P300 was wrapped in a 1 2 foil packet and initiated with an electric match the packet puffed up but did not detonate. For comparison in a testing example one gram of neat TATP similarly prepared detonated with a loud report and observable detonation wave.

In additional example testing a group of four canines EDDs that had never been exposed to neat TATP were imprinted on a TATP loaded 4.25 cm filter containing 26 mg TATP 12 . Blind testing showed that these canines successfully located not only the TATP P300 training aids but also 1 g neat TATP that was synthesized by an external organization. A group of seven canines that had trained on 1 g neat TATP synthesized by an external organization successfully located both the TATP filters and TATP P300 0.5 g portions . The table below summarizes results of this test.

At operation the dilute solution can be deposited on a porous surface prior to formation of an explosive product by the explosive reaction mixture. For example the surface can include one or more glass microfiber filters or other porous high surface area surface. In another example the surface can include an inert porous matrix such as DE having a high surface area. In either case this can yield a small amount of explosive reaction mixture spread over the high surface area.

At operation the surface is stored in a container that facilitates formation of the explosive product on the inert surface over a period of time. For example the container can include an aluminum weighing dish a glass jar etc. as described and the explosive reaction mixture can begin to react forming the explosive product over time. In this regard the explosive product itself is formed on the inert surface from the explosive reaction mixture. In one example continuous or intermittent stirring or other blending of the mixture and or the like can be used to ensure more uniform distribution of the explosive product over the inert surface.

At operation the now explosive loaded surface is removed from the container after the period of time. At operation unreacted starting materials can be removed from the surface. This can be performed in one example by rinsing the surface in copious water and then drying the surface e.g. using active drying such as a vacuum filter or passive drying . Though the amount of explosive product used in this process is significantly less per unit since it is diluted than that required to construct an explosive device the surface can exude vapors of the explosive at a rate that is at least comparable to an amount of explosive powder used in an explosive device. This is shown in example testing scenarios as described below. The removed surface can be used as the manufactured training aid material or can otherwise be used in constructing a training aid for the explosive powder. In this regard a non detonable explosive device training aid is constructed without using solvents or other products that can cause off odors.

In one example the explosive product can include hexamethylene triperoxide diamine HMTD . Thus in a specific example HMTD training aid materials can be produced by preparing a dilute solution of the reaction mixture at operation and depositing the solution onto glass microfiber filters prior to formation of the HMTD product at operation . HMTD training aids can also be produced by adding an inert high purity high surface area diluent such as DE powder to the dilute reaction mixture prior to formation of the HMTD allowing the HMTD to deposing on the high surface area diluents at operation .

In one specific example the dilute solution can be prepared at operation by diluting 19 g of 35 hydrogen peroxide to 15 by the addition of 25 g water dissolving 7 g hexamine in the diluted peroxide and cooling the reaction mixture in an ice bath to below 10 C. In addition the preparation at operation can also include adding 11 g citric acid to the peroxide hexamine solution in portions with continuous stirring while keeping the temperature below 10 C. As described the ice bath can prevent the explosive reaction mixture from reacting to immediately form the explosive product HMTD. It is to be appreciated that different amounts or substances can be used so long as the resulting compound is HMTD. After the citric acid is dissolved the solution can be deposited onto clean glass microfiber filters 1.3 g solution per 190 mg filter each in their own aluminum weighing dish at operation . The solution is allowed to react in the filter for a minimum of 3 hours or left overnight either at ambient condition or refrigerated at operation . The next day the filters are removed at operation . The filters can also be individually rinsed in copious water to remove any unreacted starting materials and partially dried on a vacuum filter funnel at operation . The filters are then stacked on the filter funnel and dried completely by pulling air through them using a vacuum filtration apparatus. The dried filters can then be used as non detonable HMTD training aids.

In another specific example the dilute solution is prepared at operation by diluting 19 g of 35 hydrogen peroxide to 13 by the addition of 32.6 g water dissolving 7 g hexamine in the diluted peroxide and cooling the reaction mixture in an ice bath to below 10 C. In addition at operation the solution can be prepared by adding 11 g citric acid to the peroxide hexamine solution in portions with continuous stirring while keeping the temperature below 10 C. Immediately after all of the citric acid has dissolved 7.6 g of DE is added with stirring to the reactant solution to allow HMTD to deposit over the entire surface of the inert matrix at operation . The entire mixture is kept in the ice bath and stirring is continued for a minimum of 3 hours or preferably left overnight to allow the reactant mixture to warm slowly to room temperature at operation . It is to be appreciated that a longer reaction time can provide better yield and higher loading of HMTD on the DE matrix. Subsequently the mixture is removed at operation and used in the construction of training aid materials.

In specific testing scenarios it was determined that when the peroxide solution is used close to full strength the HMTD loading is much higher and results in training aids that may not pass the sensitivity testing. For example using only 3.5 g water in preparing the dilute solution at operation effectively 30 hydrogen peroxide concentration produces filters with an estimated 36 HMTD mass loading. Using only 3.5 g water produces P300 powder with an estimated loading of 47 HMTD. In a specific example suitable HMTD mass loading can be expected to be in the 15 20 range and this may be achieved by diluting the peroxide solution at operation to approximately 15 concentration and by selecting filters with a high basis weight 200 mg each or by reducing the storage reaction time at operation but not less than 3 hours . The following table shows example peroxide HO concentrations and relative HMTD mass loading.

In an example testing scenario HMTD loaded filters or DE powder burned vigorously but weaker than neat HMTD in flame tests neither showed detonation tendencies in the flame tests. Preliminary impact test results in the example testing scenario indicated that higher loading 30 filters and DE powder were initiated by the drop of a 5.640 kg weight from a height of 2.6 inches onto a 0.25 diameter surface. Lower loading filters 22 were less consistently initiated in the same drop test. 36 HMTD loaded filters and 22 HMTD loaded DE powder both passed the United Nations impact test criterion as shown in the table below presenting results of example testing but neither passed the friction test in this example testing. The lower loaded DE powder came closer to passing the friction test which suggests that lowering the loading on both types of training aids should allow both to pass these tests and fall outside of the dangerous goods shipping requirements.

In this testing example two 1 gram samples of HMTD P300 were separately wrapped into 1 2 foil packets and initiated with electric matches. One sample contained nominally 47 HMTD by mass and the other contained nominally 22 HMTD by mass. Both packets simply puffed up on initiations but did not detonate. For comparison one gram neat HMTD similarly prepared detonated with a loud report and observable detonation wave.

In additional example testing a group of four canines EDDs that had never been exposed to neat HMTD were imprinted on a freshly prepared 4.25 cm filter containing an estimated 40 mg 17 HMTD. Blind testing showed that these canines successfully located not only the freshly prepared HMTD filter training aids but also aged HMTD loaded filters HMTD P300 training aids and 1 g neat HMTD that was synthesized by an external organization. A group of seven canines that had trained on 1 g neat HMTD synthesized by an external organization successfully located both the freshly prepared and aged HMTD loaded filters. The table below summarizes results of this example testing.
