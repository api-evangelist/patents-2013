Each satellite that orbits the Earth can have a distinct ephemeris. The ephemeris can include various information such as the position or orbit of the satellite on a number of dates and times in a regular sequence. Some satellites can use their orbit information for various applications. For example a satellite s orbit information can be used for altimeter and imaging system applications. A satellite in a global positioning system GPS can use its orbit information to provide location and time information anywhere on or near the Earth where a GPS receiver has an unobstructed line of sight to the GPS satellite.

Satellite navigation systems such as the GPS enable a receiver to determine a location from ranging signals received from a plurality of satellites. The ranging signals can be broadcasted on frequencies such as the L1 signal 1.57542 gigahertz GHz L2 signal 1.2276 GHz and or L5 signal 1.17645 GHz . L1 can have a wavelength of about 19 centimeters cm and L2 can have a wavelength of about 24 cm. Position can be determined from code and or carrier phase information. A code division multiple access CDMA code is transmitted by the GPS satellites to the receiver and correlated with replica codes to determine ranges to different satellites which can be used to determine the position of a GPS receiver on or near the Earth. Generally a GPS receiver receives signals from multiple GPS satellites e.g. four to find its position.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The global positioning system GPS is a space based global navigation satellite system GNSS that can provide location and time information in various types of weather anywhere on or near the Earth where a GPS receiver e.g. GPS receiver or on the Earth or GPS receiver on a satellite A H or A C has an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites A J as illustrated in . When a GPS satellite is blocked from the GPS receiver so too few GPS satellites are in view of the GPS receiver the GPS receiver can provide no positioning information or it can generate inaccurate or incorrect positioning information. Alternatively the GPS signal on known GPS frequencies may be jammed by an external jamming source or other electronic equipment preventing the GPS receiver from receiving a valid GPS signal. Alternatively an external spoofing source may generate a false GPS signal on known GPS frequencies in an attempt to spoof the GPS receiver to generate inaccurate or incorrect positioning information. As used herein GPS receiver can be used interchangeably with GPS transceiver.

Typically a GPS satellite s transmission antenna is directed towards the Earth . Each GPS satellite can transmit a GPS signal to another satellite such as a LEO satellite A H or a GEO or HEO satellite by overshooting or grazing the Earth. For example illustrates four GPS satellites A D transmitting their GPS signal A D to a LEO satellite A. In another example a GPS satellite J can transmit a GPS signal or GPS generated signal E to a single LEO satellite G where the LEO satellite can use the GPS generated signal to determine the LEO satellite s orbit via Doppler GPS orbit determination . In another configuration a GPS satellite F can transmit a GPS signal or GPS generated signal F to a single GEO or HEO satellite A where the GEO or HEO satellite can use the GPS generated signal to determine the GEO or HEO satellite s orbit. A GPS signal can be a spread spectrum pseudo random noise PRN signal that encodes the location of the transmitting satellite. In an example the GPS generated signals A F can use the L1 L2 or L5 frequency band. As used herein GPS signal and GPS generated signals can be used interchangeably to refer to a signal originating from a GPS satellite and a GPS like signal refers to a signal originating from a source other than the GPS satellite that encodes the source position versus time and or the satellite s ephemeris.

Each satellite e.g. GPS LEO MEO GEO or HEO satellite can be referred to as a space vehicle e.g. sv . The signal from a GPS satellite can be used to generate a measurement to calculate a receiver s position. Each GPS signal can be used solve for one unknown in the three dimensional 3D position of the receiver e.g. GPS receiver . Since a 3D position can have three unknowns three independent signals from three separate GPS satellites can be used to calculate a 3D position. Since the GPS satellite and the GPS receiver do not operate using a same clock a fourth independent signal from a fourth GPS satellite can be used to compensate for clock bias in the GPS receiver. So measurements from the independent GPS signals from four different GPS satellites can be used to calculate a precise GPS receiver position. Sometimes more than four satellites may be in view of a GPS receiver so additional GPS signals can provide redundancy or additional error checking for the measurements used to calculate the GPS receiver position.

A satellite e.g. LEO MEO GEO or HEO may use GPS to provide orbit determination. Space legacy orbital determination OD can be reliant on GPS and can provide on board processing of 4 or more channels of GPS signals where each signal composing a pseudo range calculation from the receiver to the transmitting satellite.

Low cost orbital determination OD capability for satellites can still be provided even when GPS may not fully available e.g. fewer than 4 GPS satellites in view of the GPS receiver where GPS signals may have regrets e.g. multipath or when at least a portion of the GPS constellation is unavailable. In an example OD can be generated using a GPS generated signal from a single GPS satellite. OD using a single GPS satellite can be robust with partial GPS capability and may provide operationally responsive space systems to rapidly reconstitute OD capability when fewer than 4 GPS satellites are available. In another example OD may be determined using a GPS signal e.g. pseudo random noise PRN code or CMDA code where a single GPS satellite can provide OD for satellites in HEO and GEO orbits which can have a low availability to receive GPS transmission F from multiple GPS satellites past an Earth horizon.

In an example orbit determination e.g. estimating up to the 6 classical Kepler orbital elements of moving platforms or vehicles can be provided by computing a trend in Doppler of a single GPS signal and decoding the position and or ephemeris of the GPS transmitter encoded in the GPS signal. The ephemeris can include a table with various information such as the positions or orbits of a heavenly body e.g. a satellite on a number of dates and times in a regular sequence.

OD using a Doppler trend of a GPS signal from a single GPS satellite can be used not only for OD of LEO platforms e.g. satellites but can also be used for GEO and HEO platforms. OD using GPS signals from a single GPS satellite can provide a second alternative for OD computing frequency difference e.g. performed in analog of 2 GPS signals e.g L1 and L2 and decoding the position of the transmitting satellite from one of the signals which can be looked up in almanac.

OD using a Doppler trend of a GPS generated signal from a single GPS satellite can be used to compare a legacy pseudo range OD with the Doppler derived OD to assess spoofing which can be used to defeat a co orbital spoofer and or transponder. OD can be determined using the Doppler trend of a dedicated alternative signal that is transponded via a GEO satellite GEO SAT that encodes the position and or ephemeris of the GEO SAT similar to a GPS satellite but in GEO . If OD derived from legacy GPS signals or OD derived using Doppler trend of GPS signals indicate spoofing a satellite receiver can switch to an alternative carrier for OD or as a jamming backup.

Orbit determination OD technology OD device methods or computer circuitry using a GPS signal from a single GPS satellite can apply Doppler trending to fit orbital elements in a way that can significantly simplify the receiver hardware and processing used. OD technology can retain a simplicity of hardware and processing. OD technology can provide an anti spoofing detection and correction. Orbit determination technology using a GPS generated signal from a single GPS satellite can be referred to as LEO inertial orbit navigation LION when used in LEO satellites. Orbit determination technology used to compare a legacy pseudo range OD with the Doppler derived OD to assess spoofing can be referred to as a LION enhanced spoofer suppressor LIONESS when used in LEO satellites.

In an example the GPS satellite transmits the GPS signal e.g. L1 . For simplicity of illustration the GPS generated signal is referred to as L1 but any GPS signal e.g. L2 or L5 can be used as long as the frequency is known and the receiver can determine the location of the transmitting satellite. The ROB decodes ephemeris of the GPS satellite and the GPS time via the transceiver or processor . Decoding the ephemeris can include demodulating the L1 signal without legacy processing. In parallel the ROB can receive each L1 signal and compute a Doppler shift and a Doppler trend. The ROB can combine measurements for OD based on the Doppler shift the Doppler trend and the GPS ephemeris. In an example the satellite s time can use the GPS time. In another example the ROB can receive a GPS generated signal from multiple GPS satellites and decode the ephemeris of for each of the GPS satellites from the GPS generated signal of the specified GPS satellite. In another example the OD can be refined with L1 signals from multiple GPS satellites. In another configuration the OD can be refined with GPS pseudorange data. Pseudorange data can include range data generated via legacy GPS processing.

The OD technology illustrated in can have the capability to predict an ephemeris using high quality and or reliable measurements of the satellite s position and or velocity for relatively low cost. Many U.S. government USG and other satellites can rely on GPS. A GPS satellite may not always be available or the satellite may interfere with or obscure some GPS signals. Since GEO or HEO satellites can face away from GPS transmission antennas since GPS transmits towards Earth GEO or HEO satellites rarely receive 4 GPS signals e.g. receives signals that go past the horizon . Satellite receivers Rx can receive up to 12 channels using a dual antenna which can solve spacecraft self obscuration. The OD technology illustrated in has the ability perform with as few as one GPS signal thus even if some signals are self obscured OD can be provided. Similarly the Doppler shift is insensitive to multipath bounces due to spacecraft structure. The use of as few as one channels can reconstitute a capability especially for an operationally responsive space system where a portion of the GPS may be out of commission. In addition the OD technology illustrated in can reduce the cost power and or size of on board system for a small satellite such as picosatellite picosat nanosatellite nanosat or CUBESAT compared to an on board system that receives and processes 4 or more signals for legacy GPS receiver processing.

Although not to be limiting in any way in some exemplary embodiments the satellite or illustrated in can be a CUBESAT or other similar type of smalI or inexpensive type satellite such as a picosatellite or a nanosatellite. The CUBESAT can be a type of miniaturized satellite that can have a volume of approximately a liter 10 centimeter cm cube with a weight less than 2 kilograms kg . The CUBESAT can use commercial off the shelf electronics components. The picosatellite or picosat can refer to an artificial satellite with a wet mass between 0.1 and 1 kg 0.22 and 2.2 lb . The nanosatellite or nanosat can refer to an artificial satellite with a wet mass between 1 and 10 kilograms kg 2.2 and 22 pounds lb . A microsatellite or microsat can refer to an artificial satellite with a wet mass between 10 and 100 kg 22 and 220 lb . These satellites can include various components capable of providing various functions such a power source or a power generation mechanism a mechanism to control heating and cooling of the satellite and or a mechanism to point a transmitter or antenna to the Earth. The power generation mechanism can include solar cells or panels. The power source can include a battery or capacitive device. The mechanism to control the heating and cooling of the satellite may control the heating and cooling of the satellite passively so the mechanism does not require a power source to function properly. The mechanism to point the transmitter or antenna to the Earth may steer or rotate the position of the satellite passively. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these several descriptions are merely exemplary and are not intended to be limiting in any way.

GPS originally evolved for terrestrial users. In GPS position determination a Doppler shift is not used. After position is determined using PRN signals Doppler can be used to determine velocity. Using a trend of Doppler shift of carrier having known and or stable frequency originating from known source e.g. a single GPS satellite the position and or velocity can be fit to orbital elements e.g. classical Kepler orbital elements . OD can be more readily accomplished for stationary sources e.g. ground or GEO but OD can also be generated from a moving object with a knowledge of a source motion e.g. ephemeris of the GPS satellite . The GPS satellite can provide a stable carrier e.g. L1 L2 or L5 used to calculate a Doppler shift and or Doppler trend but other stable and known carriers may also be used . In an example the OD technology illustrated in can be used to correct ionospheric effects for satellites between 80 1000 kilometers km . Underlying Doppler trend and orbital elements calculations can be used to generate the position and velocity of the satellite using a known stable carrier with a known motion of the source of the stable carrier e.g. GPS satellite .

GPS satellites can broadcast ultra stable signals such as L1 e.g. 1.57542 GHz and L2 e.g. 1.2276 GHz and can embed ephemeris information in a PRN signal. GPS Block 11F and later satellites can also broadcast L5 e.g. 1.17645 GHz . A single channel receiver on board ROB with visibility to a single GPS can be used to extract transmitter location and then be used to determine orbit and time. Multiple signals using multiple carriers e.g. L1 L2 and L5 from a GPS can provide greater accuracy and or integrity.

To simplify the estimation and or the ROB in another example the OD technology illustrated in can receive two GPS generated signals on different frequency bands e.g. L1 and L2 from at least one GPS. For simplicity of illustration the two GPS generated signals on different frequency bands are referred to as L1 and L2 but any carrier of opportunity e.g. L1 L2 or L5 can be used. The ROB can detect and mix the two signals e.g. L1 and L2 and compute a difference e.g. L1 L2 and use the relative Doppler signal to generate an estimation which can eliminate having a precision reference at GHz frequencies such as an on board local oscillator LO . The OD technology illustrated in can be extended to additional carriers. Using two signals common errors in a reference can largely cancel each other out. The ionosphere can have refraction that scales inversely with square of the carrier frequency i.e. f . For the satellite in the ionosphere a small scale factor relative to the altitude can be included in the estimation ROB or OD device. The second set of the GPS generated signals received by the ROB can at least partially compensate for various factors or occurrences such as atmospheric delays and refraction in the transmitted GPS generated signals.

Atmospheric delays can include ionospheric delays and tropospheric delays. Ionospheric delay occurs in the ionosphere which is a part of the upper atmosphere comprising portions of the mesosphere thermosphere and exosphere distinguished because the upper atmosphere can be ionized by solar radiation. The ionosphere can play a part in atmospheric electricity and forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere and can influence radio propagation to distant places on the Earth.

Tropospheric delay occurs in the troposphere which includes the lowest portion of the Earth s atmosphere. The troposphere contains approximately 80 of the atmosphere s mass and 99 of its water vapor and aerosols. The average depth of the troposphere can be approximately 11 kilometers km Troposphere depth can vary being deeper in the tropical regions up to 20 km 12 miles and shallower near the poles at 7 km 4.3 mi depending upon the time of year.

Refraction can be the change in direction of a wave due to a change in the index of refraction of the medium through which the signal passes. Although atmospheric refraction may not be measured the second set of signals can be used to estimate for atmospheric refraction and account for the estimate in final range estimates. Atmospheric refraction can include the deviation of light or other electromagnetic wave such as a radio frequency RF signal from a straight line as the light or other electromagnetic wave passes through the atmosphere. Refraction can occur due to the variation in air density as a function of altitude. Refraction can cause an extra path to be introduced into flight and can generate a small error in range measurements.

In essence atmospheric delays and refraction can vary the time of flight TOF and the Doppler shift of signals which variances can be accounted or compensated for by the second set of signals. If the satellite is in the ionosphere then Doppler may be affected.

Using two signals can have benefits over a single signal. Precision orbit determination utilizing on board processing of Doppler and or GPS of a single GPS generated signal with onboard algorithms can utilize a precise oscillator an ultrastable oscillator or an atomic clock which can be more expensive than a satellite with no local oscillator or a standard local oscillator. In addition orbital determination generated by the satellite often utilizes an on board local oscillator which can generate errors in measurements. Thus using two GPS generated signals orbital determination can be low cost and or less susceptible to errors in the on board local oscillator.

In another example the GPS satellite transmits L1 and L2 . The ROB decodes ephemeris of the GPS satellite and the GPS time using L1 or L2 via the transceiver or processor . In parallel the ROB can receive each L1 and L2 signal and compute a Doppler shift and a Doppler trend. The Doppler shifts can be trended and the two shifts can be compared to each other to compensate and correct for unknown refraction and ionospheric shifts. The ROB can combine corrected measurements for an OD based on the Doppler shift the Doppler trend and the GPS ephemeris. In an example the satellite s time can use the GPS time. In another example the ROB can receive a GPS generated signal from multiple GPS satellites and decode the ephemeris of for each of the GPS satellites from the GPS generated signal of the specified GPS satellite. In another example the OD can be refined with L1 and L2 signals from multiple GPS satellites. In another configuration the OD can be refined with GPS pseudorange data.

In another configuration which can be used with a GEO or HEO satellite receiving a GPS generated signal with large grazing angle which may not need to compensate for the ionosphere or refraction the GPS satellite can transmit L1 and L2 . The ROB decodes ephemeris of the GPS satellite and the GPS time using L1 or L2 via the transceiver or processor . In parallel the ROB can receive each L1 and L2 signal and compute a difference of a Doppler shift and difference of a Doppler trend. The difference of Doppler shifts can be trended to fit to orbital elements. The ROB can combine measurements for an OD based on the difference of the Doppler shift the difference of the Doppler trend and the GPS ephemeris. In an example the satellite s time can use the GPS time. Using differences of the Doppler shift and Doppler trend can provide precise OD without a precision LO in the receiver e.g. ROB . In another example the ROB can receive a GPS generated signal from multiple GPS satellites and decode the ephemeris of each of the GPS satellites from the GPS generated signal of the specified GPS satellite. In another example the OD can be refined with L1 and L2 signals from multiple GPS satellites. In another configuration the OD can be refined with GPS pseudorange data.

In another example the GPS satellite transmits three GPS generated signals e.g. L1 L2 and L5 . For simplicity of illustration the GPS generated signals are referred to as L1 L2 and L5 but any carrier of opportunity e.g. commercial coarse acquisition C A type code a military P Y type code or an M type code using a varied GPS signal structure can be used. The ROB decodes ephemeris of the GPS satellite and the GPS time using L1 L2 or L4 via the transceiver or processor . In parallel the ROB can receive each L1 L2 and L5 signal and compute a Doppler shift and a Doppler trend. The relative Doppler shifts a difference of the Doppler shift can be trended and double differences of Doppler shifts and Doppler trends can be computed and corrected to compensate and correct for unknown refraction and ionospheric shifts. The relative Doppler can be computed for two carriers with no ionospheric correction. The ROB can generate a corrected relative Doppler trend from the double differences of Doppler shifts and the corrected relative Doppler can be trended fit to orbital elements. In an example the satellite s time can use the GPS time. Using double differences of the Doppler shift and Doppler trend can compensate and correct for unknown refraction and ionospheric shifts and provide precise OD without a precision LO in the receiver e.g. ROB . Using double differences can use a simpler signal but may take longer to obtain a specified navigational accuracy over using single differences. A single difference can take longer to obtain a specified navigation accuracy over using a Doppler trend. A double difference can be a difference between two single differences.

The OD technology and geo location described can provide an improvement for real time and or time dominant applications. The OD technology described with can reduce cost of OD systems and can even use as little as a single channel receiver with one antenna without solving GPS pseudo range equations. The OD technology described can provide GPS backup by using one GPS satellite or fewer than four GPS satellites. In an example the OD technology described can combine two or more carriers from the GPS satellite or other source and estimate OD based on their frequency difference e.g. Doppler shift .

The OD technology can provide detection of GPS spoofing for satellites e.g. LEO satellites with backup capability to provide orbital determination OD . In prior related systems spoofing can occur when one or more of GPS like spoof signals are received by the satellite s ROB receiver on board in lieu of the regular GPS signals. A spoof detection system may be able to detect spoofing but may not provide a correction for spoofing or backup OD in cases of spoofing. Often an OD system may be fooled by spoofing and may not even realize spoofing is occurring. The OD technology illustrated in can provide anti spoofing detection of a co orbital spoofer and an alternate OD mechanism when spoofing occurs.

Under many spoofing conditions the OD using Doppler shift information of GPS carriers as generated by the OD technology illustrated in can provide a different result than legacy GPS OD based on pseudo range. Thus to determine an occurrence of spoofing range based OD e.g. legacy GPS OD can be compared with Doppler based OD e.g. Doppler GPS OD . The range based OD and the Doppler based OD can agree to within a small error or tolerance when spoofing is not present. If spoofing is detected the OD technology can test for signs of spoofing from a GPS simulator e.g. stationary simulator such as amplitude parity common timing of all signals and similar tests. If a GPS simulator is not detected then co orbital spoofer may be assumed. The Doppler processing can reveal a position of co orbital spoofer.

In an example each GPS satellite A D transmits the GPS generated signal A D e.g. L1 . For simplicity of illustration the GPS generated signal is referred to as L1 but any carrier of opportunity e.g. L2 or L5 can be used. Four or more GPS satellites can transmit a signal on L1. The ROB decodes ephemeris of the GPS satellite and the GPS time for each GPS satellite via the transceiver or processor . The ROB can compute OD e.g. GPS OD with GPS pseudo range data. In parallel the ROB can receive each L1 signal and compute a Doppler shift and a Doppler trend of at least one L1 signal. The ROB can combine measurements for OD Doppler GPS OD based on the Doppler shift the Doppler trend and the GPS ephemeris. In an example the satellite s time can use the GPS time. The ROB can compare the GPS OD with Doppler GPS to determine if spoofing is occurring. If spoofing is occurring the ROB can check for simulated signals and report a result. If spoofing is not occurring from simulated signals then the ROB can estimate a position of a spoofer using the Doppler GPS OD and report a result.

In another example a RF receiver can receive an additional carrier and Doppler processing can be applied to the additional carrier The carrier can be from a source of known location. The additional carrier can be a dedicated signal similar to a GPS like PRN signal from a GEO or HEO satellite. If spoofing is detected the ROB can switch to the signal on the additional carrier or carrier of opportunity for OD. In another example more than one frequency or carrier of opportunity may be used to make spoofing or jamming difficult.

When using an alternate carrier various carriers may be broadcast to the satellite e.g. LEO satellite . The carriers can enable the satellite to use a dipole or patch antenna with little directivity. The source can have a stronger signal than normally transmitted e.g. average source . For example a PRN signal can be relayed through a GEO satellite. The signal can use a format similar to a GPS format and encode a position of a source and a relay e.g. GEO satellite . For instance a tracking and data relay satellite TDRS can have a powerful S band that can close with a low directivity antenna. A number of satellites can broadcast at 3 GHz or below that can close.

Referring back to the OD technology e.g. ROB can include a voting mechanism to compare OD from multiple GPS signals with each other. Four or more GPS satellites can transmit a signal on L1. The ROB decodes ephemeris of the GPS satellite and the GPS time for each GPS satellite via the transceiver or processor . The ROB can compute OD e.g. GPS OD with GPS pseudo range data. In parallel the ROB can receive each L1 signal and compute a Doppler shift and a Doppler trend. The ROB can combine measurements for OD Doppler GPS OD based on the Doppler shift the Doppler trend and the GPS ephemeris. In an example the satellite s time can use the GPS time. The ROB can compare each Doppler based OD to the other Doppler OD. Voting can be implemented to assess if one or more signals are in error. In an example the GPS generated signal can be extended to GPS L2 and L5 carriers. The ROB can compare the GPS OD with a selected Doppler GPS or composite Doppler GPS generate via voting to determine if spoofing is occurring. If spoofing is occurring the ROB can check for simulated signals and report a result. If spoofing is not occurring from simulated signals then the ROB can estimate a position of a spoofer using the Doppler GPS OD and report a result.

The OD technology illustrated in provides detection of GPS spoofing by comparing Doppler derived OD and pseudo range derived OD. The OD technology can test each GPS Doppler as a stand alone input for OD and provide correction of GPS spoofing. In another example protection of spoofing using Doppler processing of alternate carrier e.g. signal from relay such as tracking and data relay satellite system TDRSS or other communication carrier of opportunity can be used. TDRSS is a network of American communications satellites each satellite is called a TDRS and ground stations used by National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA for space communications.

The OD technology has been demonstrated for determination of orbital parameters using a single Doppler signal e.g. from GPS or GEO satellite . The OD technology provides a method to use the trend in Doppler signal received from as few as one GPS satellite or other satellite e.g. GEO satellite transmitters whose ephemeris is known or encoded in the signal to determine the orbit of a satellite e.g. a LEO satellite .

A deterministic relationship can exist between the orbital elements of a known satellite e.g. GPS satellite and a satellite whose orbit is not known e.g. LEO satellite using classic Kepler orbital elements.

Orbital elements can be the parameters required to uniquely identify a specific orbit. illustrate diagrams of Kepler orbital elements. In orbital mechanics or astronomy orbital elements can be considered in classical two body systems where a Kepler orbit is used. The Kepler orbit can be derived from Newton s laws of motion and Newton s law of universal gravitation. Various mathematically representations can be used to describe a same orbit but the various representations can each consist of a set of six commonly used parameters. In a real orbit a satellite and its elements can change over time due to gravitational perturbations by other objects and the effects of relativity. A Keplerian orbit can be an idealized mathematical approximation at a particular time.

The classical orbital elements can include six Keplerian elements based on Kepler s laws of planetary motion. When viewed from an inertial frame two orbiting bodies e.g. the Earth and a satellite can trace out distinct trajectories. Each of these trajectories can have a focus at the common center of mass. When viewed from the non inertial frame of one body e.g. Earth the trajectory of one of the bodies e.g. satellite can be apparent. Keplerian elements can describe non inertial trajectories. An orbit can have two sets of Keplerian elements depending on which body is used as a point of reference. The reference body can be called the primary the other body can be called the secondary.

An ellipse can be used to represent an orbit. Two elements that can define a shape and size of an ellipse can be an eccentricity e and a semimajor axis a . The eccentricity e can characterize a shape of the ellipse such as describing elongation compared to a circle. The semimajor axis a can be the sum of the periapsis i.e. perigee or perihelion and apoapsis i.e. apogee distances divided by two. For circular orbits the semimajor axis is the distance between the center of the bodies not the distance of the bodies to the center of mass. The ellipse representing the orbit can be on an orbital plane .

Two elements that can define the orientation of the orbital plane of the ellipse can be an inclination e.g. the equatorial plane I or i or a longitude of the ascending node . The inclination I or i represents the vertical tilt of the ellipse with respect to the reference plane which can be measured at the ascending node where the orbit passes upward through a reference plane or plane of the celestial equator or ecliptic when the Earth is used for the point of reference . Longitude of the ascending node can horizontally orient the ascending node of the ellipse where the orbit passes upward through the reference plane with respect to a reference point or the reference frame s vernal point referred to as a vernal equinox . The intersection between the reference plane and the orbital plane can be referred to as the line of nodes which can connects the center of mass with the ascending and descending nodes.

The position of the satellite on the ellipse can be represented by an argument of periapsis and a mean anomaly at epoch M . The argument of periapsis defines the orientation of the ellipse in the orbital plane as an angle measured from the ascending node to the periapsis i.e. a closest point the second body e.g. Earth comes to the first body e.g. satellite during an orbit . The mean anomaly at epoch M defines the position of the orbiting body e.g. satellite along the ellipse at a specific time the epoch . The mean anomaly can be a mathematically convenient angle which varies linearly with time but which does not correspond to a real geometric angle. The mean anomaly can be converted into the true anomaly v which represents a real geometric angle in the plane of the ellipse between periapsis i.e. closest approach to the central body and the position of the orbiting object at any given time.

The angles of inclination longitude of the ascending node and argument of periapsis can also be described as the Euler angles defining the orientation of the orbit relative to the reference coordinate system. Non elliptic patrajectories can exist but are not closed and thus are not considered orbits. If the eccentricity is greater than one the trajectory is a hyperbola. If the eccentricity is equal to one and the angular momentum is zero the trajectory is radial. If the eccentricity is one with an angular momentum the trajectory is a parabola.

In another example the ascending node AN is the point in a satellite s orbit where the satellite crosses the plane of the celestial equator or ecliptic for a sun orbiting object going north e.g. towards the north pole . The argument of perigee is the angle between the ascending node and perigee or perihelion for sun orbiting satellites measured counter clockwise along the plane of the orbit. The eccentricity e can be half of the distance between the foci of an ellipse divided by the semi major axis. The inclination I can be the angle between the plane of the orbit and the plane of the celestial equator . The mean anomaly can be the angle that a satellite would have moved since last passing the perigee assuming that the satellite moved at a constant speed in an orbit on a circle of the same area as the actual orbital ellipse. The mean anomaly can be equal to the true anomaly at perigee and apogee for elliptical orbits or at all times for circular orbits. The semi major axis a can be half the distance between the periapsis and the apoapsis.

In another configuration the semi major axis a can be a constant defining the size of the orbit. The eccentricity e can be a constant defining the shape of the orbit where e 0 represents a circular orbit and e

Earth Centered Inertial ECI coordinates can be converted to spherical coordinates for the satellite. For example the mean motion n can be represented by

Using the classic Kepler orbital elements illustrate in and the analytic derivation of satellite position in an ECI coordinates shown above a time derivative of position representing velocity can be generated. A useful representation converting orbital elements to satellite velocity in ECI coordinates follows.

The Doppler shift can be the carrier frequency divided by c times the magnitude of the velocity difference vector of two satellites when each satellites velocity is expressed in ECI. The velocity versus time can be calculated for a GPS satellite. In an example the following assumptions can be used the semi major axis is 26 560 300 meters m the inclination is 55 degrees eccentricity is 0.001393 the mean anomaly is 2.62555 radians rad and the argument of perigee 2.56865 rad. A Doppler trend over time for a LEO satellite at inclination 45 degrees at an approximately 700 km altitude is illustrated in .

In an example a ROB can make an initial determination estimate or guess of an orbit which can be one or several determinations estimates or guesses. The ROB can compute expected Doppler trend s . The ROB can measure a Doppler trend of a test case and compute a residual. The ROB can determine a sign an inflection s an average a slope a second derivative of residual s and or a third derivative of residual s . Multiple methods such as random trial and error can be used to iterate to a solution. Priority testing can also be used to provide an adaptive approach to iterate more quickly to a result. A shape of a measurement or shape of an error can be used to determine an orbital element to adjust. For example a flat error can indicate an error in semi major axis which can be a least sensitive parameter. An error in mean anomaly can produce a slope. An error in inclination which can be sensitive parameter e.g. parameter with frequent variation can produce a much stronger second derivative and an inflection point. An eccentricity error can produce more third derivative.

A Kalman filter can efficiently estimate values of the unknown orbital elements. The Kalman filter can produce estimates of the true values of measurements and their associated calculated values by predicting a value estimating the uncertainty of the predicted value and computing a weighted average of the predicted value and the measured value. The most weight can be given to the value with the least uncertainty. The estimates produced by the Kalman filter tend to be closer to the true values than the original measurements because the weighted average has a better estimated uncertainty than either of the values that went into the weighted average. Other modules and methods may also be used in estimating orbits.

Based on the demonstration a deterministic relationship can exist between satellite orbital elements and Doppler trend. Doppler levels and residuals can be of order that can be estimated in a reasonable time e.g. real time . Doppler levels and residuals can be comparable to measurements for estimating a LEO satellite from a ground location on the Earth. Depending on a quality of an initial determination or guess on an orbit e.g. cold start an accurate initial OD can take from hundreds of second to thousands of seconds to generate. Once an orbit is estimated the errors can be comparable to ground based GPS receiver performance e.g. within meters from Doppler GPS OD .

A Doppler shift can be a change in a frequency of a wave for an observer such as a receiver moving relative to the source of the wave such as a transmitter on a satellite. The motion of the observer the source or both can generate a change of the frequency. The relative changes in frequency due to the Doppler effect can be explained as follows. When the source of the waves is moving toward the observer each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave. Therefore each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Thus the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced causing an increase in the perceived frequency. Conversely if the source of waves is moving away from the observer each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave so the arrival time between successive waves is increased reducing the perceived frequency.

Objects moving at greater velocities relative to each other can provide more accuracy in Doppler measurements than objects moving at slower velocities relative to each other. Objects at closer distances to each other can provide more accuracy in Doppler measurements than objects at farther distances to each other. The satellite operating in LEO or GEO can impose a greater amount of Doppler shift on the GPS generated signal than a satellite operating in MEO which can have a slower apparent velocity.

Each signal received by the satellite and transmitted by the GPS satellite can experience a Doppler shift in frequency due to the relative motion between the GPS satellite and the satellite transceiver. Thus each signal such as the GPS generated signal can experience a different Doppler shift from each other.
