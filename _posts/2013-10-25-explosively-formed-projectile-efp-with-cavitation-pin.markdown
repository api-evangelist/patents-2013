title: Explosively formed projectile (EFP) with cavitation pin
abstract: The invention is an explosively formed projectile (EFP). On detonation of an explosive charge, an explosively formed projectile is formed from two separate metal elements, an open-poled dished liner and a cavitation pin. The open-poled dished liner is made of a metal more dense than a metal of the cavitation pin. The cavitation pin lies on the open-poled dished liner longitudinal axis and in contact therewith. The cavitation pin has a truncated right conical shape with a base diameter to length ratio of 0.7:1 to 1.5:1. The ratio of the open-poled dished liner diameter:cavitation pin fore portion major base diameter is 2:1 to 4:1. Upon detonation, the cavitation pin leads the explosively forged liner in the explosively formed projectile assembly. The leading pin causes cavitation in water resulting in an increase in the velocity of the explosively formed projectile.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates to a munition for use in marine environment. More particularly the invention relates to an explosively formed projectile EFP . The invention also relates to a method of increasing range and velocity of an explosively formed projectile in water.

An explosively formed projectile EFP is a type of munition that combines an explosive charge with a projectile forming work piece. The work piece is shaped by explosive forging into an elongated solid projectile during explosive detonation. Besides an explosively formed projectile EFP other explosively formed projectiles include the shaped charge SC and the High Explosive Anti Tank HEAT munition.

The essential element of a shaped charge SC is a liner that on firing forms an elongated hyper velocity metal jet that is projected toward an armored target. The generally cone shaped liner has a relatively small diameter and produces deep relatively small diameter penetration of the target. Continuity of the elongated shaped charge SC jet breaks up with extended travel distance to the target. Break up alters the shape of the jet most significantly at target impact. Therefore it is necessary to reduce standoff distance to a length that allows an effective continuous jet to impact the target. In military applications the shaped charge SC is often combined with a rocket to form a rocket propelled grenade RPG assembly. In a rocket propelled grenade RPG the rocket carries the shaped charge explosive munition to the target. The explosive charge is ignited on contact with the target and the projectile jet is formed inside the shaped munition housing. This arrangement results in a very short penetrator jet travel distance before impacting the target. Shaped charges SC have high impact velocities of about 3 to 4 kilometers second.

A High Explosive Anti Tank HEAT munition also relies on a cone shaped liner that is explosively formed into a narrow relatively long jet penetrator. Relatively more time is required for the formation of the penetrator jet. The shape of the cone liner and configuration of the explosive charge are adjusted for desired results. The HEAT munition requires sufficient standoff distance from the target to form before target impact. Therefore it is necessary to increase standoff distance to a length that allows an effective jet to impact the target. A delivery mechanism ignites the explosive charge at a required distance from the target. A HEAT munition is usually contained in an anti tank shell or missile. The velocity of the shell or missile and distance from the target are included in the time of ignition calculation of the delivery mechanism. HEAT penetrators have high impact velocities of about 10 to 15 kilometers second.

An explosively formed projectile EFP is explosively forged from a dish shaped metal work piece into a single compact relatively massive penetrator. The EFP is accelerated to a velocity of 1 to 3 kilometers second which is less than the velocity of a shaped charge SC or High Explosive Anti Tank HEAT projectile. The essential explosively formed projectile EFP munition includes a generally cylindrically shaped case containing an explosive charge and a dish shaped metal liner. The dished liner is positioned at a forward end of the case and an explosive charge initiator is positioned aft. EFP warheads are designed to produce a compact high velocity penetrator. After detonation the charge produces an explosive blast pressure that accelerates the liner and simultaneously reshapes the shallow dish shaped liner by rearward folding into a compact slug shaped projectile. The compact slug is fundamentally distinguished from an elongated shaped charge SC jet or elongated HEAT jet. The EFP slug is able to traverse a relatively longer standoff distance before impacting the target and deliver a relatively large diameter high mass projectile. The destructive potential of a penetrator is quantified by kinetic energy at impact. Kinetic energy is quantified as the product of the projectile mass and the square of the impact velocity. The EFP has an impact velocity in air in the range of about 1 to about 3 kilometers second.

Explosively formed projectile EFP munitions have been developed and modified over time to facilitate penetration of armor targets. The several parameters in the munition configuration have been adjusted to achieve penetration of improved generations of ballistic armors. EFP modification investigations have been directed to penetrating land and air targets but not to targets in water. It has been thought that the formation of a slug projectile would be inhibited in a water environment. More specifically water would cause a drag on the projectile and full potential velocities could not be achieved. Explosively formed projectiles EFP have been investigated with the objective of overcoming the adverse effects of water. However the explosively formed projectile EFP has not achieved its potential in marine use.

There is a need in the naval ordnance arts for an explosively formed projectile EFP munition that performs effectively in water.

An explosively formed projectile EFP includes an open poled dished liner and port plug assembly positioned symmetrically on a longitudinal axis and has a single port positioned on the longitudinal axis. The open poled dished liner has a convex surface in contact with an explosive charge and a concave surface in contact with an air space. The open poled dished liner is made of a first metal of greater density.

The port plug is made of second metal of lesser density. The port plug is formed into a cavitation pin extending through the port intersecting the open poled dished liner. The unitary cavitation pin has a fore portion and an aft portion. The cavitation pin fore portion projects forward from open poled dished liner concave surface along the longitudinal axis into the air space. The cavitation pin aft portion projects aft from the open poled dished liner convex surface along the longitudinal axis into the explosive charge.

The cavitation pin fore portion has the shape of a truncated right cone with a major base having a major base diameter and minor base having a minor base diameter.

The cavitation pin aft portion has the shape of a right circular cone with a cone base having a cone base diameter. The major base of the frusto conical shape is joined with the cone base to form the unitary cavitation pin at the port.

On ignition of the explosive charge the cavitation pin leads the explosively formed open poled dished liner projectile slug along the longitudinal axis. The cavitation pin causes cavitation in water thereby increasing the velocity of the trailing explosively formed projectile EFP slug. As a result higher velocity explosively formed projectile EFP slug is formed resulting in higher kinetic energy impacting of a target.

The invention is described with reference to the drawing wherein numerals in the written description correspond to like numbered elements in the several figures. The drawing discloses an exemplary embodiment of the invention and is not intended to limit the generally broad scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.

Attention is drawn to showing a conventional explosively formed projectile munition EFP according to the prior art. The explosively formed projectile EFP is assembled with reference to a longitudinal axis which is also ordinarily a nominal axis of rotation for most of the essential elements of the projectile. Longitudinal axis is labeled fore FORE and aft AFT to indicate relative position of the elements of the projectile mounted along the longitudinal axis. Firing direction is indicated by arrow FIRE. Arrow FIRE also indicates the direction in which the detonation wave not shown travels.

A projectile forming explosive charge comprises any of the explosive materials useful for this application. In general explosive materials are referred to in the art as either an ideal explosive or a non ideal explosive. Ideal explosives rely on the chemical bonds between carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen in the molecular structure for their explosive potential. By way of example ideal explosives include LX 14 OCTOL C 4 PBXN 110 Comp B Pentolite Amatex 40 TNT and any of the other ideal explosive that may be machined to fit snugly within cylindrical case and against the convex surface of dished explosive charge liner . Non ideal explosives are distinguished from ideal explosives. Non ideal explosives rely on mixing of explosive fuel and oxidizer for explosion to occur. Although less common for this application non ideal explosives have been used in explosively formed projectiles.

Electric cable is attached to detonator to transmit an electric charge to ignite intensifying charge . A relatively much smaller intensifying charge is in direct contact with explosive charge and made of an explosive material that is relatively more sensitive to ignition than explosive charge . Intensifying charged provides the ignition to explosive charge by exploding and forcing solid explosion debris into explosive charge .

The term pole is used with reference to the longitudinal axis. The term apical is used with reference to position on the apex or aft most point of the open poled dished liner . Port is referred to in the art as the open pole or pole port and the dished liner referred to as an open poled dished liner. Port is bounded by surface of dished liner and has a diameter D.

Pole plug is shown in phantom lines. Pole plug also has a circular diameter that allows it to fit into port in circumferential contact with surface to completely fill apical port . Phantom lines in show that pole plug fits directly into port . The fit is firm so that pole plug is retained in place. Dished liner is referred to as open poled with or without the presence of pole plug .

In an equivalent configuration dished liner has a diameter approximately equal to the inside diameter of case . In this equivalent configuration toroidal support is not present. Clips not shown replace toroidal support to attach dished liner to case and hold position relative to longitudinal axis . After ignition explosive forces scatter any clips or toroidal support as insignificant debris.

In an explosively formed projectile EFP a cylindrical charge made of an explosive material is ignited to collapse symmetrically a dish shaped liner metal material on itself in an air cavity. The air cavity is geometrically defined by a concave face of the dish shaped liner. A cavitation pin lies on and along a longitudinal axis of the liner. The cavitation pin is made of a metal of lesser density than the dish shaped liner metal. The explosively collapsing liner metal material is forged radially inwardly toward the longitudinal axis and simultaneously propelled longitudinally outwardly with the cavitation pin along the longitudinal axis in the direction of the detonation wave which is caused by detonated explosive material. This explosive forging and propelling generates a high velocity solid projectile with the lesser density cavitation pin material fore and the greater density liner material aft along the longitudinal axis.

In operation an air space fills the cavity on the fore side of the open poled dished liner and extends outward from it to the munition housing. The cavitation pin fore portion is retained before firing in contact with this air space. An explosively modified solid projectile is formed from the cavitation pin followed by a slug forged from the liner during the brief passage of the metal materials through the air space. The lesser density explosively modified cavitation pin leads the greater density collapsed compact liner along the longitudinal axis. Since they are traveling at the same velocity position of the two differing explosively modified solids is not significantly altered relative to each other as they move together along the longitudinal axis. In particular the lesser density cavitation pin material remains the fore edge of the projectile combination throughout the entire flight that is through the air cavity and through the water to the target. Geometric shape of the fore less dense cavitation pin causes water to cavitate. The greater density collapsed compact liner i.e. the slug follows closely benefiting from the cavitation caused by the pin. The benefit is a higher velocity for the slug projectile than could have otherwise been achieved in water.

First on ignition potential energy in the explosive material is transferred to a detonation wave. Second energy from the detonation wave is transferred to the compact mass of collapsing liner material and cavitation pin. The collapsed liner slug which is formed has a kinetic energy quantified by the product of the mass and the squared velocity of the compact solid mass.

The character of the damage that a projectile imparts to a target is related to the diameter and mass of the projectile as well as the projectile velocity squared at impact. Mass is related to continuity of the explosively formed projectile. An explosively formed projectile EFP slug is a compact i.e. highly continuous relatively massive projectile. The mass has a high kinetic energy at impact in comparison to a shaped charge SC jet or a HEAT projectile jet. Additional characteristics of target damage relate to physical parameters of the target itself such as armoring and are not addressed here.

The present invention increases kinetic energy of the projectile in water at target impact by an amount equal to the square of the increase in velocity. The result is a more efficient transfer of kinetic energy to the target and increased target penetration and damage. The magnitude of the penetration damage perpendicular to the longitudinal axis is determined by selection of liner mass and diameter which is known in the art.

First time period T is the event prior to firing the explosively formed projectile EFP. The explosively formed projectile munition EFP is constructed with reference to a longitudinal axis which is also ordinarily an axis of rotation for the essential elements of the munition. Longitudinal axis is labeled aft AFT to the left and fore FORE to the right to provide reference for the orientation of the elements of the projectile on the axis. Firing direction is indicated by arrow FIRE. FIRE is also the direction in which a detonation wave not shown travels.

A projectile forming explosive charge includes any of the explosive materials listed above for explosive charge . Explosive charge fits within cylindrical case and against open poled dished charge liner . Cavitation pin is attached to open poled dished charge liner in air space AIR filling the space between open poled dished charge liner and the hydrodynamic nose cone NOSE of munition EFP. The munition EFP is aimed and fired at target TARGET by conventional procedures.

In second time period T explosively formed projectile munition EFP is fired by igniting explosive charge causing the explosive formation of the cavitation pin to be modified into explosively modified pin moving generally along longitudinal axis in the direction indicated by arrow FIRE. It is essential that explosively modified pin be formed in air space AIR to achieve a compact continuous solid that is the fore edge of the entire projectile is formed. The projectile should not be formed in water. Simultaneously charge liner is collapsed and explosively formed into a slug projectile . Slug projectile is also propelled along longitudinal axis in the general direction indicated by arrow FIRE. During second time period T the cavitation pin forms explosively modified pin and charge liner forms slug projectile . Explosively modified pin leads while slug projectile follows along longitudinal axis in the direction indicated by arrow FIRE. The second time period T event takes place in the air space AIR.

In third time period T an explosively modified pin leaves air space AIR and enters WATER. In water explosively modified pin causes cavitation track along the longitudinal axis up to a TARGET. The closely following slug projectile also enters WATER. However slug projectile receives the benefit of traversing the distance to the TARGET in the cavitation track caused by the fore explosively modified pin . The velocity of slug projectile is measurably increased. As a result the kinetic energy of slug projectile at impact with TARGET is increased causing increased penetration and damage of TARGET.

It has been found that velocity of an explosively formed projectile EFP may be increased in water by carefully constraining the explosively formed projectile EFP to certain well defined physical parameters.

There are four physical parameters. First it is essential to attach a cavitation pin to the open poled dished charge liner on the longitudinal axis i.e. the nominal axis of rotation of both the cavitation pin and the open poled dished liner. The cavitation pin should intersect the open poled dished liner. In the intersection a major portion of the mass of cavitation pin must lie on the concave side of the liner with a minor portion in contact with the explosive charge.

Regarding the second parameter it is essential that the cavitation pin is made of a metal which is less dense than the metal of which the charge liner is formed. Metals of particular interest are aluminum zirconium copper titanium lithium silver magnesium molybdenum tantalum manganese tin iron nickel zinc boron and silicon. An exemplary combination is an aluminum cavitation pin and a copper open poled dished charge liner.

Regarding the third parameter it is essential that the truncated right cone shaped cavitation pin has an aspect ratio of the cavitation pin major base diameter cavitation pin length which ranges from about 0.7 1 to about 1.5 1. In an exemplary embodiment the aspect ratio is dependent on orientation of the cavitation pin on the longitudinal axis and more particularly in an exemplary embodiment the aspect ratio is about 1 1.

Regarding the fourth parameter it is essential that the truncated right cone shaped cavitation pin has a diameter ratio of the shaped charge liner diameter the cavitation pin fore portion major base diameter which ranges from about 2 1 to about 4 1.

In theory the invention relies on cavitation and super cavitation to increase velocity of a projectile in water. Cavitation occurs within water when the water pressure is reduced to below the vapor pressure. The result is a vapor bubble within the liquid volume. The cavitation pin is explosively formed into an elongated solid metal penetrator. The elongated penetrator is laterally streamlined with a sharp edged flat leading surface. Importantly the flat leading surface deflects water radially outward as it travels. This motion creates a pressure drop particularly following the aft surface. The sharp edge of the flat leading and trailing surfaces enhance the pressure drop. The result is a vapor track following the cavitation pin.

The charge liner is explosively formed into a compact slug. The compact slug follows the cavitation pin closely in the vapor track. The leading and following positions are maintained.

The cavitation pin and charge liner dimensions are selected so that the cavitation pin forms a vapor track of sufficient diameter where the compact slug travels entirely within the vapor track. The selected dimensions are the aspect ratio of the pin major base diameter cavitation pin length and the diameter ratio of the shaped charge liner diameter cavitation pin major base diameter. Accordingly as the compact slug travels in the vapor track it essentially avoids contact with liquid water. This phenomenon is referred to as super cavitation. The result of super cavitation is an increase in velocity due to reduced frictional drag. Kinetic energy of the slug penetrator is thereby increased.

The munition was dynamically simulated by computer modeling. A time sequence of events was recorded as follows 

2. The fired munition traversed the air space and impacted the surface of the water time 0.5 milliseconds.

4. The munition achieved ultimate penetration of 30.7 feet and was stopped by the water time 30.5 milliseconds.

The munition was dynamically simulated on computer. A time sequence of events was recorded as follows 

2. The fired munition traversed the air space and impacted the surface of the water time 0.5 milliseconds.

4. The munition achieved ultimate penetration of 14.25 feet and was stopped by the water. Super cavitation diameter was 6.7 inches time 7.4 milliseconds.

Performance of a shaped charge SC or an explosively formed projectile EPF is measured by target penetration. The charge liner is explosively formed into a penetrator projectile and travels a standoff distance to the target. It then penetrates the target and travels a penetration distance into the target until its kinetic energy is expended.

A shaped charge SC penetrator was simulated using a well known simulation program. Optimum standoff distance for a conical shaped charge penetrator into water was calculated. The results are shown in . It was found that the optimum standoff distance for a conical shaped charge was about 8 charge diameters.

An explosively formed projectile EFP stretches the metal liner to form a single unitary projectile. Water interferes with shaping forging the projectile and causes rapid erosion and slowing on penetration. As a result penetration and standoff distance are greatly reduced by formation of the projectile in water.

An explosively formed projectile EFP was simulated using the same well known simulation program used in Example 3. The results are shown in . The simulation showed that the optimum standoff distance for an explosively formed projectile EFP in water was about 2 charge diameters.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
