This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 232 863 filed on Sep. 14 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 589 481 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

An increasingly popular form of networking may generally be referred to as remote presentation systems which can use protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol RDP and Independent Computing Architecture ICA to share a desktop and other applications executing on a server with a remote client. Cloud computing refers to a computing environment for enabling on demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources. Many cloud computing services involve virtualized resources such as those described above and may take the form of web based tools or applications that users can access and use through a web browser as if they were programs installed locally on their own computers.

Many applications are designed for use by a single user. For example AutoCAD was designed as a single tenant application and intended to be used by a single user and not multiple users simultaneously. In contrast a web based multi tenant application such as Bing is intended to be accessed simultaneously by millions of users.

In a cloud computing system it is often desirable to provide access to software applications that were not designed to be executed in such an environment. Disclosed are methods and systems for presenting a software application to a plurality of users in a cloud computing environment. For example an application that was designed for use by a single user is provided in a cloud based platform without re architecting the application. Using a web based interface multiple cloud users may launch and execute the application. The various instances of the application are presented to the cloud users as if the application were designed as a multi user application.

Certain specific details are set forth in the following description and figures to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the disclosure. Certain well known details often associated with computing and software technology are not set forth in the following disclosure to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the various embodiments of the disclosure. Further those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that they can practice other embodiments of the disclosure without one or more of the details described below. Finally while various methods are described with reference to steps and sequences in the following disclosure the description as such is for providing a clear implementation of embodiments of the disclosure and the steps and sequences of steps should not be taken as required to practice this disclosure.

It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or where appropriate with a combination of both. Thus the methods and apparatus of the disclosure or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the disclosure. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device generally includes a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the processes described in connection with the disclosure e.g. through the use of an application programming interface API reusable controls or the like. Such programs are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

A remote desktop system is a computer system that maintains applications that can be remotely executed by client computer systems. Input is entered at a client computer system and transferred over a network e.g. using protocols based on the International Telecommunications Union ITU T.120 family of protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol RDP to an application on a terminal server. The application processes the input as if the input were entered at the terminal server. The application generates output in response to the received input and the output is transferred over the network to the client

Embodiments may execute on one or more computers. and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing environment in which the disclosure may be implemented. One skilled in the art can appreciate that computer systems can have some or all of the components described with respect to computer of .

The term circuitry used throughout the disclosure can include hardware components such as hardware interrupt controllers hard drives network adaptors graphics processors hardware based video audio codecs and the firmware software used to operate such hardware. The term circuitry can also include microprocessors configured to perform function s by firmware or by switches set in a certain way or one or more logical processors e.g. one or more cores of a multi core general processing unit. The logical processor s in this example can be configured by software instructions embodying logic operable to perform function s that are loaded from memory e.g. RAM ROM firmware and or virtual memory. In example embodiments where circuitry includes a combination of hardware and software an implementer may write source code embodying logic that is subsequently compiled into machine readable code that can be executed by a logical processor. Since one skilled in the art can appreciate that the state of the art has evolved to a point where there is little difference between hardware software or a combination of hardware software the selection of hardware versus software to effectuate functions is merely a design choice. Thus since one of skill in the art can appreciate that a software process can be transformed into an equivalent hardware structure and a hardware structure can itself be transformed into an equivalent software process the selection of a hardware implementation versus a software implementation is trivial and left to an implementer.

A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk magnetic disk optical disk ROM or RAM including an operating system one or more application programs other program modules and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the computer through input devices such as a keyboard and pointing device . Other input devices not shown may include a microphone joystick game pad satellite disk scanner or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through a serial port interface that is coupled to the system bus but may be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port game port or universal serial bus USB . A display or other type of display device can also be connected to the system bus via an interface such as a video adapter . In addition to the display computers typically include other peripheral output devices not shown such as speakers and printers. The system of also includes a host adapter Small Computer System Interface SCSI bus and an external storage device connected to the SCSI bus .

The computer may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers such as a remote computer . The remote computer may be another computer a server a router a network PC a peer device or other common network node a virtual machine and typically can include many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer although only a memory storage device has been illustrated in . The logical connections depicted in can include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices enterprise wide computer networks intranets and the Internet.

When used in a LAN networking environment the computer can be connected to the LAN through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment the computer can typically include a modem or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network such as the Internet. The modem which may be internal or external can be connected to the system bus via the serial port interface . In a networked environment program modules depicted relative to the computer or portions thereof may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are examples and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used. Moreover while it is envisioned that numerous embodiments of the disclosure are particularly well suited for computer systems nothing in this document is intended to limit the disclosure to such embodiments.

Referring now to depicted is a high level block diagram of a computer system configured to effectuate virtual machines. As shown in the figures computer system can include elements described in and components operable to effectuate virtual machines. One such component is a hypervisor that may also be referred to in the art as a virtual machine monitor. The hypervisor in the depicted embodiment can be configured to control and arbitrate access to the hardware of computer system . Broadly stated the hypervisor can generate execution environments called partitions such as child partition through child partition N where N is an integer greater than or equal to 1 . In embodiments a child partition can be considered the basic unit of isolation supported by the hypervisor that is each child partition can be mapped to a set of hardware resources e.g. memory devices logical processor cycles etc. that is under control of the hypervisor and or the parent partition and hypervisor can isolate one partition from accessing another partition s resources. In embodiments the hypervisor can be a stand alone software product a part of an operating system embedded within firmware of the motherboard specialized integrated circuits or a combination thereof.

In the above example computer system includes a parent partition that can also be thought of as domain in the open source community. Parent partition can be configured to provide resources to guest operating systems executing in child partitions N by using virtualization service. Each child partition can include one or more virtual processors such as virtual processors through that guest operating systems through can manage and schedule threads to execute thereon. Generally the virtual processors through are executable instructions and associated state information that provide a representation of a physical processor with a specific architecture. For example one virtual machine may have a virtual processor having characteristics of an Intel x86 processor whereas another virtual processor may have the characteristics of a PowerPC processor. The virtual processors in this example can be mapped to logical processors of the computer system such that the instructions that effectuate the virtual processors will be backed by logical processors. Thus in these example embodiments multiple virtual processors can be simultaneously executing while for example another logical processor is executing hypervisor instructions. Generally speaking and as illustrated by the figures the combination of virtual processors and memory in a partition can be considered a virtual machine such as virtual machine or .

Generally guest operating systems through can include any operating system such as for example operating systems from Microsoft Apple the open source community etc. The guest operating systems can include user kernel modes of operation and can have kernels that can include schedulers memory managers etc. A kernel mode can include an execution mode in a logical processor that grants access to at least privileged processor instructions. Each guest operating system through can have associated file systems that can have applications stored thereon such as terminal servers e commerce servers email servers etc. and the guest operating systems themselves. The guest operating systems can schedule threads to execute on the virtual processors and instances of such applications can be effectuated.

The computing resources provided by the data centers may be enabled by one or more individual data centers. The data centers are facilities utilized to house and operate computer systems and associated components. The data centers typically include redundant and backup power communications cooling and security systems. The data centers might also be located in geographically disparate locations.

The user computer may be utilized to configure aspects of the computing resources provided by the data centers . In this regard the data centers may provide a Web interface through which aspects of its operation may be configured through the use of a Web browser application program executing on the customer computing system . Alternatively a stand alone application program executing on the customer computing system might access an application programming interface API exposed by the data centers for performing the configuration operations. Other mechanisms for configuring the operation of the data centers including deploying updates to an application might also be utilized.

In one embodiment the processes may be virtual machine instances. A virtual machine instance may be an instance of a software implementation of a machine i.e. a computer that executes programs much like a physical machine executes programs. In the example of virtual machine instances each of the servers may be configured to execute an instance manager capable of executing the instances. The instance manager might be a hypervisor or another type of program configured to enable the execution of multiple processes on a single server for example.

It should be appreciated that the network topology illustrated in has been greatly simplified and that many more networks and networking devices may be utilized to interconnect the various computing systems disclosed herein. Appropriate load balancing devices or software modules might also be utilized for balancing a load between data centers between each of the server computers in each data center and between instances purchased by each customer of the data centers. These network topologies and devices should be apparent to those skilled in the art.

Cloud computing generally refers to a computing environment for enabling on demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources e.g. applications servers and storage such as those described above. Such a computing environment may be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Cloud computing services typically do not require end user knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the system that delivers the services. The services may be consumption based and delivered via the Internet. Many cloud computing services involve virtualized resources such as those described above and may take the form of web based tools or applications that users can access and use through a web browser as if they were programs installed locally on their own computers.

Cloud computing services are typically built on some type of platform. For some applications such as those running inside an organization s data center this platform may include an operating system and a data storage service configured to store data. Applications running in the cloud may utilize a similar foundation.

In one embodiment and as further described in a cloud service can implement an architecture comprising a stack of four layers as follows 

In one embodiment of a cloud computing platform a stamp may be implemented and used to define a unit of isolation and may be configured to define a traditional remote desktop deployment. A remote desktop controller component can be provided that maintains customer artifacts and credentials manages loads across stamps and provisions and resizes stamps. A remote desktop controller can also create and manage applications and desktops. Whereas a particular end point provides the virtual equivalent of a user s desktop the stamp or multiple stamps provides the virtual equivalent of a company s computing infrastructure.

The layers described above may involve a number of components. Such components may include the following which are further described below.

Referring to depicting a compute component an application may be implemented as one or more roles as described above. The cloud service may run multiple instances of each role using load balancing to spread requests across the roles.

A portal may be provided to allow a developer to submit an application to the cloud service. The portal may be configured to receive configuration information that informs the cloud platform of how many instances of each role to run. The fabric controller component may create a virtual machine VM for each instance and run the code for the appropriate role in that VM. Requests from the application s users can be made using protocols such as HTTP HTTPS and TCP. The requests can be load balanced across all instances of a role.

Referring to depicting a storage component the cloud platform may provide data storage using a number of data structures and formats. For example data storage can be provided as an unstructured blob of binary data . Metadata can be used to provide information as to content. In order to allow applications to work with data in a more structured fashion cloud storage services may provide storage as groups of entities that are associated with properties. Applications may also be provided a means to query data such as for example an API that includes search parameters. Additionally cloud storage can provide a way for web role instances to communicate asynchronously with worker role instances. For example a user might submit a request to perform some compute intensive task via a web interface implemented by a web role. The web role instance that receives this request can write a message into a queue describing the work to be done. A worker role instance that is waiting on this queue can then read the message and carry out the specified task. Results can be returned via another queue.

The cloud storage service may replicate data in order to provide fault tolerance. Furthermore data can be backed up copy in another data center in a different physical location for redundancy and enhanced availability.

Referring to a fabric controller component may be a distributed application replicated across a group of machines. The fabric controller component can be configured to own all of the resources in its environment such as computers switches and load balancers. The fabric controller component can also monitor running applications determine where new applications should run and select physical servers to optimize hardware utilization. The fabric controller component can also be configured to start monitor and terminate virtual machines.

In an embodiment and referring to the cloud service can store copies of data at sites closer to the clients that use the data. For example the first time a particular piece of data is accessed by a user the content delivery network component can store a copy of that data i.e. cache at a location that is geographically close to that user. The next time the data is accessed the contents can be delivered from the cache rather than from the more remote original.

In an embodiment and referring to in order to support the applications and data used within an organization on premises environments may be connected with the cloud service. In an embodiment this type of combination can be effectuated by providing IP level connectivity between a cloud application and machines running outside of the cloud. An endpoint agent can be installed on each on premises computer that connects to a cloud application. The cloud application may also be configured to work with the cloud connect component . The agent can use protocols such as IPsec to interact with a particular role in that application. By using such an agent the potential complexity of configuring protocols such as IPsec can be transparent to the user while providing a much simpler connection than methods such as virtual private networks VPNs . Once the connection is established roles in a cloud application can appear to be on the same IP network as the on premises machine.

By establishing such connections a cloud application can access an on premises database directly. A cloud application can also be domain joined to the on premises environment allowing a single sign on to the cloud application by on premises users and the use of existing active directory accounts and groups for access control.

In various embodiments a remote desktop computing experience can be provided in which a desktop provider can provide an elastic pool of desktops from which an administrator can easily provision and manage numerous user desktops much in the same manner as provisioning and managing a single user desktop. The remote desktop user can thus be provided with a desktop experience that is always available free of administrative procedures and billed based on consumption. For application providers such a service can enable the application providers with minimal effort to provide traditional desktop applications to users in the form of web applications.

As businesses move to adopt remote or virtual desktops as a means to centralize the administration of secure and compliant employee desktops it would be advantageous for IT administrators to be able to provide a homogenous desktop environment in order to control and minimize costs. Thus a platform that can provide a plurality of remote or virtual desktops can provide scalable and homogenous computing environments at low cost. By architecting a hosted desktop solution on a cloud platform in a manner similar to that of a homogenous computing model IT administrators can be provided an environment that can significantly lower cost as compared to traditional Desktop as a Service alternatives.

A cloud computing platform can be configured to operate with and provide benefits to multiple users and providers. For example for an application provider that provides applications to an enterprise desktop provider or a desktop reseller a cloud computing platform may be configured to provision and sell traditional desktop applications in a scalable cloud model. The application provider may be enabled to create an application provider account with payout account information upload application packages test uploaded applications on a selected operation system publish the application on an application marketplace on the cloud monitor application usage and set user charges per user.

Referring to illustrated is an example block diagram depicting a process for providing remote desktop services in a cloud computing framework. A user may access via a browser a web page that provides an entry point to the remote desktop services accessible to the user and configured in accordance with the user s IT departments requirements. The user may log onto the system using credentials provided to the user. The credentials may be a persistent ID such as a Windows Live ID or OpenID. A user will then be redirected to an authentication server which may require entry of a username and password over a secured connection. Once authenticated the user may be issued a password that is persisted for that user the password being provided to other services so that additional authorization is not required. In an embodiment the password may be persisted for that user even if the desktop session ends unless the user explicitly logs off from the session.

A mechanism may be provided for automatically logging into a cloud based system in which a single user authentication and authorization process permits a user to access the resources in the cloud based system where the user has access permission without the need to enter multiple passwords. Providing single sign on allows users to log in once and access multiple applications without the need to enter more passwords. Single sign on is desirable for enterprises by increasing security and efficiency by reducing the number of passwords that must be maintained. For cloud service providers single sign on provide a better user experience by allowing users greater access without additional authentication effort.

A cloud based service may not accept token log on credentials generated by a single sign on service. For example a web ID provider or single sign on service may prompt a user for sign on credentials and the service may generate a ticket or tokens that can be used for connecting to other services. Examples of such systems may include Windows Linux and iOS. It is desirable to give users in an on premises enterprise domain for example single sign on access to applications running in the cloud service.

In an embodiment when a user logs into a cloud based desktop and provides authentication credentials a one time password may be automatically generated and persisted. The generated one time password may be used to log in automatically to additional processes in the cloud based system. In one embodiment the generated one time password can be persisted until the user explicitly logs off. Thus even when the desktop session is unexpectedly terminated the password can be persisted.

In another embodiment a user may have an account with a service that provides integrated on line services such as Windows Live or Yahoo. Such a service may provide a set of services and software products such as email and multimedia services that are accessible using a single user ID and password. In an embodiment a user of such an integrated service may also be provided an option to access cloud based computing services as described above. Thus when a user has opted for cloud based computing services as part of such an integrated service once the user has logged on to the service the user may be presented an option to accessed the cloud based computing service and request a remote desktop session. Because the cloud based service e.g. the remote desktop may not accept the credentials from the integrated service the cloud based service may generate an account with a one time password that allows the user to access the desktop session. The details of the one time password need not be provided to the user since the password only exists for the duration of the session or until the user logs off. In an embodiment the one time password may be persisted so that the user may return to the desktop if the desktop is inadvertently disconnected without having to restart the logon process.

In an embodiment illustrated in client may enter a URL for his company s cloud based service home page . Alternatively the user may enter a URL for an integrated online service. The user may be directed to an online authentication service which prompts the user for authentication credentials. The online authentication service may be a service used by the administrator for the user and the user s credential information may be provided by the administrator to the cloud service authorizing the service to create a user profile and allowing the user to launch and access desktops. Alternatively the online authentication service may be provided by the integrated online service. Once the user is authenticated the user is directed to a homepage the user can access the cloud service with the credentials provided by the online authentication service. The cloud service generates a one time password and or a temporary user account and the user s one time password is sent to an endpoint . As described above the endpoint can be a user desktop session.

The one time password may be generated based on the credentials received by the online authentication service. In an embodiment the password can be stored in a local credentials store in the virtual machine hosting the user session. Thus the password is not persisted with the user in the user s profile thus allowing for enhanced security and avoiding the need for the cloud service to maintain permanent passwords for each user.

The user can be presented with a number of desktops e.g. an engineering desktop a finance desktop etc. that can be selected and logged into. For example each desktop can be tailored to a specific functionality. The user may be presented with the specific desktops based on predefined authorization. Once the users select a desktop a new desktop instance may be instantiated for that user. If a previous desktop instance is selected the session associated with the previous desktop instance may be resumed. The session for this user and session for other users can be launched as endpoints within a virtual machine that hosts a number of such sessions. A saved profile may be associated with each endpoint that is created or resumed that includes the user s preference and state information from a previous session and other information needed to maintain the user s state so the user s session can be persisted paused and resumed. Generally a desktop may consist of an operating system applications and settings. A desktop instance generally refers to a desktop plus a specific user profile. In some cases a desktop instance and a desktop session may be used interchangeably.

In an embodiment multiple sessions can be launched for additional users. Referring to the example embodiment illustrated in multiple sessions corresponding to multiple endpoints may be instantiated as additional users log into the system. Furthermore the users may comprise multiple user types as defined by the administrator for the group of users. For example as shown in the figure multiples users of both Type and Type may log into the system and begin sessions. For example Type may be a finance type desktop and Type may be an engineering type desktop. Of course other examples are also possible. A virtual machine may be configured to host a number of sessions of one or more types. In one embodiment the numbers of sessions may be independent of the underlying virtual machine configuration that is hosting the various user sessions. As additional user sessions are instantiated on the virtual machine additional virtual machines may be launched. In one embodiment a set number of remote desktop sessions can be configured to execute on a virtual machine. As more remote desktop sessions are needed another virtual machine can be launched. An elastic pool of virtual machines may be provided so that sessions can be dynamically added at any time without the need for an end user or administrator to understand the underlying details for the structures providing the services.

Since the user may be assigned a virtual machine VM endpoint from a pool of available VM endpoints the next time that a user logs in the user may be connected to any one of the VM endpoints in the pool. In order to create a custom desktop experience for the user the user s preferences and state data may be saved. In one embodiment the user s preference and state data may be saved to a set of data that may be associated with the user so that any time that the user logs on and is assigned a desktop the user preference and state data may be obtained so that the user s previous desktop state can be resumed. So for example if the users is associated with a session i.e. end point on a first virtual machine and later is assigned to a different session on a different virtual machine the user s desktop state from the first virtual machine would generally not be available to the session on the second virtual machine. However according to an aspect of the disclosure the user s state is saved independently of the session and the particular VM endpoint. As described in the present disclosure such a set of user data may be referred to as a virtual profile. In various embodiments the virtual profile may be implemented and referred to as a virtual hard drive or virtual hard disk VHD . As such when the user is connected with a session on a different virtual machine the previous user s state can be migrated to the new session. This feature allows a single master desktop that is designed to serve a particular Type to have a custom feel for each particular user. The result is that a user of an otherwise generic session environment is perceived by the user as having a personal desktop look and feel.

As discussed above during the course of a user session a client may open and close remote access connections to the cloud service and during any given connection the client may change settings and preferences in the session. A mechanism is described herein for provisioning remote desktops in a cloud based infrastructure while maintaining user personalization. In cloud based systems a user may not always reconnect to the same virtual desktop. In one embodiment the virtual profile assigned to a user may be mounted to the endpoint assigned to the user. The virtual profile may include information such as the user s personal data and personalization information e.g. settings profiles files application data etc. .

When the user disconnects or logs off from the remote desktop the virtual profile is demounted from the endpoint and saved for subsequent user sessions. The virtual profile thus saves information regarding the user s state when the user is disconnected and provides the information as needed for launching the next user session.

Since a user may be assigned a VM endpoint from a pool of available VM endpoints the next time that a user logs in the user may be connected to any one of the VM endpoints in the pool. In order to create a custom desktop experience for the user the user s saved preference and state data may be used to provide the customized desktop experience regardless of the particular VM endpoint to which the user is connected.

While the terms virtual profile and VHD are used to describe a data structure for saving a user s preference and state information it should be understood that the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to any particular file or data format. In one embodiment a virtual profile or a VHD may be a virtual hard disk file format that is configured as data that is typically found on a physical data disk drive.

Initially a virtual profile or a VHD may be populated with data operable to configure a user s desktop in accordance with the standard desktop configuration as defined by for example a company IT administrator. Thus a virtual profile or a VHD may include data defining the gold image of the desktop i.e. the standard desktop configuration for a user role . Nevertheless as a user uses a particular remote desktop and begins to customize the desktop by for example changing the wallpaper adding music saving local documents etc. that information is stored to the virtual profile or a VHD and an each time thereafter that a user is connected to a standard remote desktop it is populated with the data from the virtual profile or a VHD to provide the look and feel of a custom user experience.

Any combination of user types i.e. desktop types may be defined within the boundaries of a single cloud service boundary. For example cloud service boundary may define a single service boundary as defined and configured for a set of services provided to a particular company and accessible using a predetermined URL which when entered via a browser may provide a web interface for logging on to the service and accessing the desktops configured for service.

In an embodiment when a user session is requested a connection to a connection broker may initially be requested. The connection broker may determine the stamp associated with the requested user session and select a virtual machine that is hosting user sessions within the identified stamp. For example if the request indicates that a user session is desired the connection broker may search a database that includes IP address port number combinations or network identifiers to find a suitable virtual machine being hosted on a cloud server. The connection broker can generate a redirection request that causes the user session to be associated with the identified virtual machine.

Referring to the embodiment described in an endpoint may be notified that a user has logged into the system. The system searches for a virtual profile and determines whether a virtual profile already exists for the user . If there is no virtual profile for the user then a virtual profile is created 1703. If a virtual profile already exists for the user or if a virtual profile was created then the user virtual profile is moved to the endpoint . The user desktop session may be launched . When it is determined that the user has logged out then the virtual profile is dismounted from the endpoint and saved for subsequent use.

A mechanism is now described for presenting a software application to a plurality of users in a cloud computing environment. For example an application that was designed for use by a single user is provided in a cloud based platform without re architecting the application. Using a web based interface multiple cloud users may launch and execute the application. The various instances of the application are presented to the cloud users as if the application were designed as a multi user application.

In an embodiment an application architected for a single user may be provided on a cloud based platform. An application provider may access a web site or other use interface to upload a single user application and request that the single user application be accessible to multiple users via the cloud based platform. Although the application was not designed for multiple user access the present disclosure provides a mechanism by which such an application may be made accessible to an unlimited number of users without the need for the application provider to re architect the application.

In a cloud computing environment executing an application architected for a single user may result in a circumstance in which processing power hardware is readily available but in which the software architecture is such that the application is not amenable for presentation to multiple users or multiple user sessions. For example in the case of a single user the single use application may be allocated resources according to the needs of the application and the application may be executed on a single set of resources.

In an embodiment one or more portions of the single use application may be parsed and multiple instances of the one or more portions of the software may be instantiated in one or more endpoints running in one or more virtual machines. Each of the one or more portions of software may then be associated with one or more user sessions and rendered for presentation to each of the user sessions. Each of the one or more user sessions may be in communication with the corresponding instance of the one or more portions of the software and may send and receive data indicative of instructions associated with the application s processes. Thus the one or more portions of software associated with the one or more user sessions may send and receive data to and from a user via the user session. A request received by an instance of the one or more portions of software may be executed on the one or more virtual machines.

In another embodiment a single instance of an application architected for a single user may execute in a virtual machine. A multi tenant application manager may be in communication with a plurality of user sessions and for each user session the multi tenant application manager may maintain a state of the user session s interaction with the application. The application may receive and process requests from the user sessions. A snapshot of the user display may be rendered for each user session.

In one embodiment the multi tenant application manager may add and or remove resources from a pool of available resources for the application. Further the multi tenant application manager may queue requests each user session. In another embodiment multiple instances of the application may be instantiated each instance being associated with a user session. Each instance of the application may then maintain their own states for their respective user sessions.

In an embodiment an application provider may access the cloud data service and using a web or other user interface can upload a single user application that the provider wishes to make available to multiple users. The provider may selection options such as a URL e.g. www.mysingleapp.com and a fee structure that users should pay in order to use the single use application. Typically such a single use application would be a complex application that was originally designed for single users and which would be expensive to rearchitect to offer as a multiple user application on a per use basis. Often a user may be willing to pay a fixed fee for a single use of such an application rather than the high cost of purchasing a complex application that may be used infrequently. The application provider may upload the software to the cloud and select a fee based on usage or daily monthly or weekly access for example. Users may pay by credit card be billed etc.

The cloud service provider may host a web site that is accessible by the URL selected by the application provider. The user may be provided a web page that provides information about the single use application. The user may be provided options for selecting a fee payment option. Referring to the user may be directed to an payment and authentication service which prompts the user for payment information. Once the user is authenticated the user is directed to a welcome home page . The cloud service generates a one time password and or a temporary user account and the user s one time password is sent to an endpoint . As described above the endpoint can be a user desktop session. The user desktop session then begins an instance of the single use application and in accordance with one of the embodiments described above. The user is presented via the user s screen a graphic representation of the single use application which appears to the user to be an instance of the single use application

In another embodiment from the perspective of the user session after logging on to the cloud computing system via a web page the user may be presented a desktop that may further include an option to select the single use application. The user may select the single use application and be presented via the user s web browser an interface that represents the look and feel of the actual user interface for the single use application as if the single use application were executing locally on a local set of computing resources. Multiple users may access the single use application in parallel user sessions each session appearing to independently access and execute the single use application.

As described above user preference and state data may be saved to a data structure that may be associated with the user so that any time that the user logs on and is assigned a desktop the user preference and state data may be obtained and the user s previous desktop state can be resumed. According to an aspect of the invention the user s state with regard to the single use application is saved independent of the particular session and the particular virtual machine host. Such a set of user data may be referred to as a VHD as discussed above. Thus when the user revisits the website in order to access the single use application or re launches the single use application via a remote desktop session the previous user data and saved data files and any preferences with respect to the single use application can be migrated to the new session.

Operation illustrates providing access via the one or more user remote desktop operating environments an indication of an application capable of accepting input from a single user.

Operation illustrates receiving via the one or more user remote desktop operating environments requests to access the single user application.

Operation illustrates for each request instantiating the single user application on each of the one or more user remote desktop operating environments and allowing each of the plurality of users to substantially simultaneously access one of the instantiated single user applications.

Operation illustrates maintaining state data for the instantiated single user applications so that the instantiated single user applications can be resumed in a subsequent session.

Any of the above mentioned aspects can be implemented in methods systems computer readable media or any type of manufacture. For example a computer readable medium can store thereon computer executable instructions for deploying a software application to multiple users in a virtualized computing environment. Such media can comprise a first subset of instructions for instantiating a virtualized computing infrastructure that makes available via a remote network connection one or more user remote desktop operating environments to a plurality of users via a web based user interface a second subset of instructions for providing access via the one or more user remote desktop operating environments an indication of an application capable of accepting input from a single user a third set of instructions receiving via the one or more user remote desktop operating environments requests to access the single user application a fourth set of instructions for each request instantiating the single user application on each of the one or more user remote desktop operating environments and allowing each of the plurality of users to substantially simultaneously access one of the instantiated single user applications and a fifth set of instructions for maintaining state data for the instantiated single user applications so that the instantiated single user applications can be resumed in a subsequent session. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additional sets of instructions can be used to capture the various other aspects disclosed herein and that the five presently disclosed subsets of instructions can vary in detail per the present disclosure.
