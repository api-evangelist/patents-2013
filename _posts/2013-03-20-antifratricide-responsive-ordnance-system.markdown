The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates to identification friend or foe IFF systems and in particular to an anti fratricide responsive ordnance system that uses the power of a friendly radio frequency signal to detect and identify a friendly force. Upon identification an electronic safe and arm device disarms the munition when it enters a kill radius of the friendly force emitting the friendly radio signal.

Fratricide or the inadvertent killing of friendly forces by other friendly forces has been a persistent concern probably since the inception of warfare. Even with the advancement of smart weapons fratricide by indirect fire projectiles after the munition is fired has not been eliminated. A conventional solution to fratricide has been the use of an identification friend or foe IFF system.

In general an IFF system is an identification system that enables a military interrogation system to identify a friendly force and to determine whether a potential target should be engaged. Although the IFF system has proven to be helpful there still remains a need for an anti fratricide responsive ordnance system that disarms the munition particularly during flight after it is has been fired.

Numerous IFF systems reconnaissance systems and safety and arming devices have been proposed among which are those described in the following publications Prestwood U.S. Pat. No. 3 298 023 Hulland et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 642 648 Joguet U.S. Pat. No. 5 001 488 Jelinek U.S. Pat. No. 5 327 145 Hulderman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 025 795 Galli U.S. Pat. No. 7 295 296 Arevalo et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8 176 834 Lucas et al. U.S. Patent Application No. 2006 0042494 and Ivtsenkov et al. U.S. Patent Application No. 2010 0289691.

However many of these systems propose pre fire IFF line of sight interrogation based approaches to identify whether a potential target is a friend or a foe.

Therefore a need arises for a post fire IFF non line of sight non interrogation based system that disarms an approaching munition when it enters a kill radius of the friendly force and which is capable of re arming the munition upon exiting the kill radius. The need for such an anti fratricide system has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention addresses the foregoing concerns and presents a new post fire IFF non line of sight non interrogation based anti fratricide responsive ordnance system also referred to herein as the system the present system or the present anti fratricide system that disarms an approaching munition when it enters a kill radius of the friendly force and which is capable of re arming the munition upon exiting the kill radius.

To this end the present anti fratricide system provides a last line of defense for friendly forces once a munition projectile or ordnance has been launched and targeted by other friendly forces.

The present system includes a field element that is in the possession of the friendly force under the fratricide attack whether it is a ground combat vehicle a single soldier or a group of soldiers. This field element performs the function of transmitting a weak RF signal or another electromagnetic EM signal which may be encrypted that is referred to herein as the friendly signal or IFF signal.

Upon reception of the IFF signal by a receiver located on the munition the receiver recognizes and identifies the IFF signal as a friendly IFF signal and further determines the power level of the IFF signal. Upon determining that the power level of the IFF signal has reached a predetermined strong or high level threshold the receiver emits a command signal to a safe and disarm.

In response to the command signal a safe and disarm mechanism disarms the munition so that the munition does not explode upon impact. The munition at that point is essentially a dud or a weak kinetic energy weapon. Elimination of the high explosive will likely save the lives of the friendly forces.

The weak RF signal from element is set to a specific distance based on the power used so that it is still set to explode if it is a safe distance from the friendly forces such as the kill or casualty radius of the munition.

If the receiver determines that the power level of the IFF signal has not reached a weak or low level threshold it does not interfere with the arming or disarming of the munition. If on the other hand the receiver determines that the power level of the IFF signal has reached the weak level threshold but has not yet reached the strong level threshold it establishes a line of communication with the fuse receiver of the munition in readiness of the munition approach toward the kill zone and to the issuance of the disarm signal.

If at any stage of the flight trajectory of the munition it is determined that the munition has exited the kill zone after it has previously entered it then the field element retransmits a cancellation command signal to the receiver onboard the munition. The cancellation command signal causes the fuze element to re arm the munition so that is detonates upon impact or as initially programmed.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

With reference to it illustrates a first exemplary fratricide scenario that is addressed by an anti fratricide responsive ordnance system of the present invention. According to this scenario a launching platform such as a cannon mortar or another launching system fires an ordnance or projectile shown in flight toward a friendly force . The friendly force can be for example and without limitation a ground combat vehicle a single soldier or a group of soldiers.

The friendly force uses a battlefield radio frequency RF signal or another IFF signal that identifies the friendly force . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention an IFF transmitter that transmits such IFF signal is known and available and therefore the present anti fratricide system does not necessarily require substantial hardware software or modification to be made to the existing transmission equipment.

The transmitted IFF signal is naturally attenuated as it is progressively distanced from the friendly source . The present anti fratricide system uses this attenuation property of the IFF signal to establish two zones for estimating the distance of the ordnance from the friendly force .

The first zone is referred to as the strong signal zone within which the IFF signal is still relatively strong and has not been attenuated below a strong signal threshold. The strong signal zone defines a kill radius of the friendly force whereby the ordnance poses imminent deadly danger to the friendly force and is in the terminal stage of its ballistic path. Consequently the present anti fratricide system disarms the ordnance as long as it is within the strong signal zone.

The second zone is referred to as the weak signal zone within which the IFF signal is relatively weak has been attenuated below the strong signal threshold of the strong signal zone but still has not been attenuated below a weak signal threshold of the weak signal zone. The entry of the ordnance into the weak signal zone indicates a potential danger to the friendly force and the present anti fratricide system enters into an alert stage but does not necessarily disarms the ordnance .

As long as the ordnance does not enter the strong signal zone the present anti fratricide system does not disarm the ordnance .

Having described the general function of the present anti fratricide system its main components will now be described in more detail in connection with . The present anti fratricide system generally includes the IFF transmitter that was described earlier as the field element and an ordnance receiver .

With reference to the IFF transmitter transmits an IFF signal that is for example similar to the signals transmitted by a Single Channel Ground Air Radio System SINCGARS radio or a related system. The IFF transmitter generally includes a code generator that encodes the IFF signal generated by a radio transmitter . A power amplifier PA amplifies the encoded IFF signal and transmits it over an antenna .

The following free space path loss FSPL equation is used by the IFF transmitter to estimate the amount of RF power needed to cover the target distance that established the strong signal zone and the weak signal zone FSPL dB 20 log 20 log 20 log 4 1 . where f refers to the operating frequency d refers to distance and c refers to the speed of light.

The ordnance receiver will now be described in more detail in connection with . The ordnance receiver generally includes an antenna that receives the IFF signal transmitted by the IFF transmitter and that transmits the IFF signal to an IFF receiver .

The ordnance receiver further includes an impedance matching network that compensates for signal distortion introduced by an RF power and signal detector of the ordnance receiver . Such distortion would otherwise affect the range at which the present anti fratricide system operates.

The ordnance receiver also includes a fuze arming disarming mechanism or Electronic Safe and Arm Device ESAD that either arms or disarms a fuze as it will be described later in more detail in connection with .

With more specific reference to a digital signal processor DSP of the RE power and signal detector receives the baseband signal from the IFF receiver .

The digital signal processor also decodes the transmitted RF code for a friendly or foe comparison. The digital signal processor further interfaces with the fuze arming disarming mechanism via a digital signal converter to control arm disarm and re arm of the ordnance .

In general the digital signal processor embeds a software an algorithm an application or a computer program product which requires that two conditions are met The first being that the computed distance between the ordnance and the friendly force is within range and the second being that the RF friendly code be identified prior to instructing the fuze arming disarming mechanism to disarm the fuze . Otherwise the digital signal processor continues to instruct the fuze arming disarming mechanism to arm the fuze .

The fuze arming disarming mechanism also referred to as the electronic safe and arm device or ESAD controls the fuze and the explosives on the ordnance . The fuze arming disarming mechanism arms the ordnance by charging a high powered detonation capacitor and then releasing that energy via a high power MOSFET into an explosive chain. A disarm command instructs the fuze arming disarming mechanism to release that energy to electrical ground instead of the explosive chain.

The interface between the fuze arming disarming mechanism and the digital signal processor can be for example RS422 signals and Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter UART protocol.

The process of operation of the present anti fratricide system will now be described in connection with and . At step of the process the launch platform receives a fire mission.

At step the launching platform failing to identify friendly forces in the vicinity fires the ordnance at step .

At step while the ordnance is still in flight it continues to verify its surrounding environments for IFF signals. If the ordnance does not detect an IFF signal it arms the fuze at step .

If however the ordnance detects and confirms an IFF signal at the digital signal processor or the RF power detector onboard the ordnance measures the signal power level at step in order to calculate the distance of the ordnance from the friendly force .

At decision step the digital signal processor determines if the measured IFF signal power level has exceeded a predetermined weak signal power threshold. If it has not then the digital signal processor determines that the ordnance does not pose an imminent danger to the friendly force and consequently it does not disarm the fuze step .

Otherwise if at step the digital signal processor determines that the measured IFF signal power level has exceeded the predetermined weak signal power threshold then it proceeds to step where it confirms and decrypts the IFF signal and sets an alert condition in preparation for disarming the ordnance .

The digital signal processor then proceeds to decision step where it inquires if the measured IFF signal power level has also exceeded a predetermined strong signal power threshold. If it has not then the digital signal processor still determines that the ordnance does not pose an imminent danger to the friendly force and consequently it does not disarm the fuze step but maintains the alert condition step .

With more specific reference to the ordnance has entered the weak IFF signal zone but has not entered the strong IFF signal zone and then continues its flight to exit the weak IFF signal zone. In this scenario the digital signal processor does not disarm the fuze and further removes the alert condition upon the ordnance exiting the weak IFF signal zone.

If however at step the digital signal processor determines that the measured IFF signal power level has exceeded the predetermined strong signal power threshold then it proceeds to step where it disarms the fuze . This scenario is illustrated in .

The digital signal processor then proceeds to decision step where it determines if the weak signal power threshold is detected again. If it has not then the digital signal processor maintains the disarm condition at step as illustrated in .

If the digital signal processor determines at decision step that the weak signal power threshold has been detected again then the digital signal processor proceeds to step where it determines that the ordnance has exited the weak IFF signal zone and thus does not pose an imminent threat to the friendly force . Consequently the digital signal processor rearms the fuze as illustrated in .

While the IFF signal is shown in as being transmitted by the friendly force the IFF signal is shown as being transmitted by an independent IFF unit in . Otherwise the operation of the present anti fratricide system is identical to that described earlier in connection with .

It should be understood that other modifications may be made to the present design without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
