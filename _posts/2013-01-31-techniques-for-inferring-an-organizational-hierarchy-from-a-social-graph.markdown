This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 729 997 filed Nov. 26 2012.

The present disclosure generally relates to data processing systems. More specifically the present disclosure relates to methods systems and computer program products that estimate the hierarchy of an organization from entries and relationships in social graphs of a social network service.

Social network platforms have information on aspects of their members social lives. People s relationships is one primary kind of such information. Therefore relationship mining on social networks is becoming a promising research direction but previously it has dealt only with explicit relations i.e. one has background knowledge to follow in addition to the data while uncovering the target relationship. For example people can discover advisor advisee relation in an academic collaboration network using the background knowledge of the properties of publication and collaboration records. However in many practical cases there are no such explicit clues. The relations are latent when there is little or no background knowledge. For example on a professional social network service managers may have connections with their employees. Although this manager employee relation exists on the network inferring it is an extremely challenging task. Due to its latent nature usually none of the features like connections job titles working experiences and the like explicitly indicates working relations directly. Furthermore the relation can be hierarchical. However from pairwise manager employee relations on a professional social network the organization structure of a company may be able to be inferred. For example the latent social relationship may be inferred and used to a construct a hierarchy from heterogeneous data sources. Since the relation is latent there is appears to be no single source or straightforward combination of sources of data that contain explicit clues of it. Concepts in the physics domain such as the effect of gravitational force on escape velocity may be used to design a force based schema to integrate the information from heterogeneous sources on social networks harmonically to predict the pairwise latent relations. The hierarchy construction may be modelled with a Reduced Markov Decision Process which utilizes pair wise relations. This may be achieved by relationship mining on an online social network service.

Generally speaking online social network services provide users with a mechanism for defining and memorializing in a digital format their relationships with other people. This digital representation of real world relationships is frequently referred to as a social graph. Many social network services utilize a social graph to facilitate electronic communications and the sharing of information between its users or members. For instance the relationship between two members of a social network service as defined in the social graph of the social network service may determine the access and sharing privileges that exist between the two members. As such the social graph in use by a social network service may determine the manner in which two members of the social network service can interact with one another via the various communication and sharing mechanisms supported by the social network service.

Some social network services aim to enable friends and family to communicate and share with one another while others are specifically directed to business users with a goal of facilitating the establishment of professional networks and the sharing of business information. For purposes of the present disclosure the terms social network and social network service are used in a broad sense and are meant to encompass services aimed at connecting friends and family often referred to simply as social networks as well as services that are specifically directed to enabling business people to connect and share business information also commonly referred to as social networks but sometimes referred to as business networks or professional networks .

With many social network services members are prompted to provide a variety of personal information which may be displayed in a member s personal web page. Such information is commonly referred to as personal profile information or simply profile information and when shown collectively it is commonly referred to as a member s profile. For example with some of the many social network services in use today the personal information that is commonly requested and displayed as part of a member s profile includes a member s age e.g. birth date gender contact information home town address the name of the member s spouse and or family members a photograph of the member interests and so forth. With certain social network services such as some business network services a member s personal information may include information commonly included in a professional resume or curriculum vitae such as information about a person s education employment history job skills professional organizations and so forth. With some social network services a member s profile may be viewable to the public by default or alternatively the member may specify that only some portion of the profile is to be public by default. As such many social network services serve as a sort of directory of people to be searched and browsed.

Because social network services are a rich source of information about people social network services are an extremely useful tool when performing certain tasks. For example many people use social network services to search for and or browse member profiles that exhibit various desired characteristics. For instance a person may search for persons who have profiles indicating the possession of certain technical skills and educational and professional experiences and backgrounds. Similarly when someone needs to hire a person employed in a particular profession e.g. a general contractor a doctor a lawyer a landscaper a plumber an investment banker and so forth that person may turn to a social network service to identify persons who possess the requisite skills and qualifications. In another scenario a person may desire to contact someone for the purpose of exploring or proposing the possibility of a particular business arrangement or relationship. Accordingly the person may use a social network service to identify the appropriate persons to contact.

The present disclosure describes methods systems and computer program products for inferring the hierarchy or the estimation of the hierarchy of an organization by leveraging a social graph of a social network service to identify and convey information about various connection paths and relationships between and among members as defined in or inferred from the social graph of the social network service. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of different embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without all of the specific details and or with variations permutations and combinations of the various features and elements described herein.

Consistent with embodiments of the invention some of the many tasks people commonly use a social network service to perform are improved by conveying to a user of the service specific information concerning the associations e.g. relationships and affiliations that a user or an entity on whose behalf the user is acting e.g. a company group or other organization with which the user is associated might share in common with another member of the social network service while the user is performing a particular task. Specifically the inventive concepts described herein involve techniques for analyzing a social graph to identify connection paths connecting a user or some other entity with another member of the social network service and then to present a visual representation of those connection paths that are determined to be the strongest or best suited for a particular purpose. While social graphs used by many conventional social network services model only the relationships that exist between people embodiments of the present invention use a social graph that includes not only people but other types of entities as well. For example a social graph consistent with some embodiments of the invention may include entity types such as companies educational institutions groups and so forth. As such a connection path in the social graph that connects two members may be based on a wide variety of associations between the various entities including personal relationships between members a common employment relationship with a particular company common membership in a group and so forth.

The algorithmic processes used to identify and present the connection paths connecting a user with a target member are implemented with a combination of hardware e.g. computer processors and memory and software e.g. executable instructions that may be generally referred to herein as a pathfinder module. Furthermore the inventive concepts that are presented herein are generally applicable to a wide variety and nature of applications and tasks. However for brevity the examples of the inventive concepts described herein are primarily presented in the context of two specific types of applications including applications involving electronic or digital messaging or communication systems and techniques and applications for facilitating browsing and searching of member profiles.

Consistent with some embodiments of the invention a social network service maintains a social graph implemented as a graph data structure having nodes and edges where the nodes represent different entities and the edges represent various associations or relationships between entities. For example with some embodiments the entity types may include people companies educational institutions e.g. schools and universities and groups e.g. online groups or professional organizations among others. Accordingly the edges that connect any two nodes entities represent types of associations between the entities and will therefore depend in part on the entities involved. For example an edge connecting two nodes that represent people may be representative of a specific type of relationship between the two people including a direct bilateral connection between the two people. An edge connecting a first node representing a person with a second node representing a company may be representative of an employment relationship current or previous between the person and the company. In addition to the edges having a particular type representative of the nature of the relationship between two entities each edge connecting two entities is assigned an edge score to reflect the strength or relevance of the particular association.

Consistent with some embodiments when a user is performing a particular task the social network service e.g. specifically the pathfinder module will perform an algorithmic process to analyze the social graph and to identify the connection paths that connect a user e.g. the person performing the task or some entity specified by the user and on whose behalf the user may be acting with another member of the social network service. The connection path or paths that are determined to be strongest or most relevant with respect to the particular task being performed are then visually presented to the user providing the user with important contextual information for completing the task. For purposes of the present disclosure to distinguish the person involved in the performance of a task with those persons who may be subjects of a task the term user is used herein to identify the person who is performing a task while the terms target and or target member are used to identify a subject of the task. Similarly in the specific context of a digital messaging application the terms message sender and message recipient are used herein. While a message recipient is the member to whom a message is addressed a message sender is the user performing the task of preparing and sending a message on his or her own behalf or on behalf of an entity such as a company group or other organization.

Consistent with some embodiments of the invention for each connection path connecting a user to a target member a path score is derived to reflect the overall connection strength or relevance of the path connecting the user with the target. For example with some embodiments the path score may be derived by simply aggregating e.g. summing or otherwise combining with an algorithm or formula the individual edge scores that correspond with the edges connecting the nodes that ultimately connect the user with the target member. As described in greater detail below a variety of algorithms may be used to derive the individual edge scores for a particular edge and or edge type connecting any two nodes in the social graph. Similarly a variety of algorithms may be used to derive the path scores for the connection paths connecting a user with a target. For example with some embodiments various weighting factors may be applied to influence e.g. increase or decrease the edge score for a particular edge type e.g. the type of association existing between two nodes in the social graph based on the particular task for which the connection paths are being identified and presented. In any case once the various connection paths connecting a user or some user specified entity to a target member have been identified and ordered or ranked by path score a visual representation of the connection path having the highest path score may be presented to the user. With some embodiments a visual representation of several independent connection paths may be presented.

In the context of a messaging application and particularly a web based messaging application consistent with some embodiments of the invention when a message sender has addressed a message to another member of the social network service e.g. a message recipient the message sender is presented with a visual representation of the best connection path or paths connecting the message sender to the message recipient as determined by analysis of the social graph maintained by the social network service. With some embodiments the algorithm used to derive path scores for the various connection paths connecting the message sender to the message recipient may be selected based on an inferred type of communication or an explicitly selected type of communication. For instance with some embodiments the social network service may use machine learning techniques and or various algorithms to infer the type of communication e.g. the purpose or reason the message sender is communicating with the message recipient and then based on this information a particular algorithm for deriving the path scores may be selected. With some embodiments the message sender may explicitly select or otherwise specify the type of communication such that the selected communication type will influence the algorithm used to derive the path scores for the connection paths connecting the message sender with the message recipient. By tailoring the algorithm that may be used to derive the path scores to a specific task e.g. sending a message and or a specific context for a task e.g. a type of communication for the task of sending a message the most relevant connection path s can be presented to the user based on the task and context in which the task is being performed.

With some embodiments the visual representation of the best connection path or paths e.g. the connection path or paths with the highest path scores may be automatically embedded or otherwise included in the content of a message being prepared by the message sender. Consequently when the message recipient receives the message the message recipient can view a visual representation of the best connection path or paths connecting the message sender with the message recipient. Alternatively the connection path or paths may be presented in a manner that allows the message sender to simply reference the relevant information when the message sender is composing the message. For instance with some embodiments the visual representation of the connection path may be presented as a separate element of a graphical user interface displayed when the message sender is composing the message. Similarly the visual representation of the connection path or paths may be presented to a message recipient not as part of a received electronic message but instead as part of a separate user interface element that is presented when the message recipient is accessing and viewing the electronic message. In either case by identifying and then presenting information indicating how the message sender and message recipient are associated or related e.g. connected via the social graph the message recipient is more likely to be receptive to receiving reading and replying to the message. This is particularly advantageous in an environment where people are frequently overloaded with information and are receiving hundreds of messages per day.

With some embodiments and specifically in the context of an application that enables users to search for or otherwise browse member profiles the strongest or most relevant connection path or paths connecting the user with a target member will be presented when the user is viewing the profile of the target member. For example a user may perform a search of member profiles by specifying various desirable member attributes or characteristics. For instance a person may perform a search by specifying one or more member profile characteristics including a company at which one is employed a job title a college or university attended and one or more possessed skills. In response to the person s query the social network service may present to the person a list of members having member profile attributes or characteristics that match partially or fully the characteristics specified in the query. When the person selects a particular member from the list the person will be presented with the selected member s profile information. In addition the social network service may present a visual representation of a connection path connecting the person to the selected member where the connection path has been selected for having the highest path score of all connection paths connecting the person with the target member. Alternatively a visual representation of several individual connection paths may be presented. With some embodiments the connection path or paths may be presented automatically with the profile information of the selected member. Alternatively with some embodiments a graphical user interface element e.g. a button or link may be provided with the selected member profile such that when the person selects or otherwise interacts with the graphical user interface element the social network service will invoke the algorithmic process for identifying and presenting the connection path having the highest path score.

With some embodiments the user that is performing a search of member profiles or otherwise browsing member profiles may specify as a sort of proxy an alternative entity e.g. person company or other organization to serve as the starting or beginning node for purposes of identifying the connection paths to an identified target member. For instance if an independent party has been tasked with inferring the organization chart for a particular part of a particular company party may specify that the company be used as the starting node in the social graph of any connection paths to a particular target member. As such a pathfinder module of the social network service will attempt to identify and present connection paths connecting the specified company with the identified target member. In such a scenario the nodes forming the connection paths between the company and the target member may include entities of various types including but not limited to members who are current or past employees of the specified company other companies that are associated with the specified company and schools whose graduates are employed by the specified company.

Referring again to a messaging application consistent with some embodiments a message sender may compose a message intended for multiple message recipients. For instance a person may use the social network service to compile a list of target members to contact as potential candidates for a job opening. The person may then compose a single generic message to be sent to all the target members on the list without manually personalizing or customizing the content of the message for each individual member specified as a message recipient. In general the connection paths from the message sender the person or the company on whose behalf the person is acting to each message recipient will be different. In this scenario the pathfinder module of the social network service is automatically invoked once for each individual message recipient. With each invocation the pathfinder module will attempt to identify connection paths connecting the message sender with an individual message recipient. Upon successfully identifying one or more connection paths the message content to be communicated to a particular message recipient will automatically be modified to include a description or graphical visualization of one or more of the strongest or most relevant connection paths. In this way the messaging application can perform a mass customization operation to customize or personalize an otherwise general or generic message so that that a customized or personalized instance of the message is communicated to each message recipient. In particular the customized or personalized message may include a visual representation of a connection path between the message recipient and the message sender or the message recipient and some entity on behalf of which the message is being communicated. Alternatively the message may include information identifying one or more entities in the connection path with an indication of how the message sender or the entity on whose behalf the message is being sent and the message recipient are associated. The personalization of the message to provide some social context will increase the relevance of the message to the particular message recipient.

With some embodiments in addition to presenting the user with a visual representation of the connection path with the highest path score the actual path score may be presented to the user. The path score may be normalized in some manner for easy comparison with other path scores thereby giving the user a sense of which connection paths may be best for a particular task. The path score may be conveyed on some arbitrary scale e.g. a scale of one to five with one being a low score and five being a high score or simply as a raw number. Additionally the visual representation of the connection path connecting the user with the target member may be presented in an interactive manner such that additional information about various entities and associations e.g. relationships and or affiliations may be easily obtained by the user for example by manipulating a cursor control device or interacting with a touch sensitive display to select or hover over various user interface elements included in the visual representation of the connection path.

With some embodiments various user interface controls may be presented with the visual representation of the connection path thereby allowing the user to very quickly navigate or cycle through the many connection paths connecting the user with the target member or filter and or sort the connection paths based on various connection path parameters. For example by selecting a particular button or link associated with a navigation control the view of the visual representation of the connection path with the highest path score may be replaced with a view of a visual representation of the connection path with the second highest path score. With some embodiments user interface controls may be presented to enable the user to filter and or sort connection paths based on certain entities entity types edge types and or any combinations thereof. For instance a filtering mechanism may allow the user to select for presentation only those connection paths that include a particular type of entity e.g. a person a company a school or university or a group or even a particular entity e.g. all connection paths including a specific entity such as the person John Smith or a specific educational institution such as Stanford University . Similarly the filtering mechanism may enable the user to identify a particular entity to be excluded from all connection paths such that only those connection paths that do not include the selected entity will be presented to the user. With some embodiments the filtering mechanism may enable the user to specify various requirements concerning the number of nodes in a connection path such as a maximum minimum or exact number of nodes separating the user with the target member. For instance the user may desire to view a visual representation of all connection paths between the user and a target member where the number of nodes between the user and the target member is two or less. Accordingly the pathfinder module will select for presentation only those connection paths satisfying the specified requirements and will generally present the selected connection paths in an order with the connection path having the highest path score presented first. Additionally with some embodiments various controls may allow the user to explicitly select other connection path parameters that influence the algorithm used to derive the path scores for the connection paths. Further detail about the technological operation of social networks useful in embodiments hereof may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 430 284 entitled Leveraging a Social Graph for use with Electronic Messaging assigned to the assignee of this patent and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Various embodiments of the inventive subject matter presented herein provide the aforementioned features and advantages as well as other advantages which will be readily apparent from the following description of the various figures. is a block diagram illustrating various functional components of a social network system with a pathfinder module for use with a wide variety of applications and specifically for identifying and then presenting connection paths connecting a user or user specified entity with a target member of the social network service consistent with some embodiments of the invention. As shown in the social network system is generally based on a three tiered architecture consisting of a front end layer application logic layer and data layer. As is understood by skilled artisans in the relevant computer and Internet related arts each module or engine shown in represents a set of executable software instructions and the corresponding hardware e.g. memory and processor for executing the instructions. To avoid obscuring the inventive subject matter with unnecessary detail various functional modules and engines that are not germane to conveying an understanding of the inventive subject matter have been omitted from . However a skilled artisan will readily recognize that various additional functional modules and engines may be used with a social network system such as that illustrated in to facilitate additional functionality that is not specifically described herein. Furthermore the various functional modules and engines depicted in may reside on a single server computer or may be distributed across several server computers in various arrangements. Moreover although depicted in as a three tiered architecture the inventive subject matter is by no means limited to such architecture.

As shown in the front end consists of a user interface module e.g. a web server which receives requests from various client computing devices and communicates appropriate responses to the requesting client devices. For example the user interface module s may receive requests in the form of Hypertext Transport Protocol HTTP requests or other web based application programming interface API requests. The client devices not shown may be executing conventional web browser applications or applications that have been developed for a specific platform to include any of a wide variety of mobile devices and operating systems.

As shown in the data layer includes several databases including databases for storing data for various entities of the social graph including member profiles company profiles educational institution profiles as well as information concerning various online or offline groups . In addition the graph data structure is implemented with a graph database which is a particular type of database that uses graph structures with nodes edges and properties to represent and store data. Of course with various alternative embodiments any number of other entities might be included in the social graph and as such various other databases may be used to store data corresponding with other entities.

Consistent with some embodiments when a person initially registers to become a member of the social network service the person will be prompted to provide some personal information such as his or her name age e.g. birth date gender interests contact information home town address the names of the member s spouse and or family members educational background e.g. schools majors etc. current job title job description industry employment history skills professional organizations and so on. This information is stored for example in the database with reference number .

Once registered a member may invite other members or be invited by other members to connect via the social network service. A connection may require a bi lateral agreement by the members such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly with some embodiments a member may elect to follow another member. In contrast to establishing a connection the concept of following another member typically is a unilateral operation and at least with some embodiments does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member follows another the member who is following may receive automatic notifications about various activities undertaken by the member being followed. In addition to following another member a user may elect to follow a company a topic a conversation or some other entity which may or may not be included in the social graph. Various other types of relationships that may exist between different entities and represented in the social graph data are described in connection with .

The social network service may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information often customized to the interests of the member. For example with some embodiments the social network service may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. As such at least with some embodiments a photograph may be a property or entity included within a social graph. With some embodiments members of a social network service may be able to self organize into groups or interest groups organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. Accordingly the data for a group may be stored in database . When a member joins a group his or her membership in the group will be reflected in the social graph data stored in the database with reference number . With some embodiments members may subscribe to or join groups affiliated with one or more companies. For instance with some embodiments members of the social network service may indicate an affiliation with a company at which they are employed such that news and events pertaining to the company are automatically communicated to the members. With some embodiments members may be allowed to subscribe to receive information concerning companies other than the company with which they are employed. Here again membership in a group a subscription or following relationship with a company or group as well as an employment relationship with a company are all examples of the different types of relationships that may exist between different entities as defined by the social graph and modelled with the social graph data of the database with reference number .

The application logic layer includes various application server modules which in conjunction with the user interface module s generates various user interfaces e.g. web pages with data retrieved from various data sources in the data layer. With some embodiments individual application server modules are used to implement the functionality associated with various applications services and features of the social network service. For instance a messaging application such as an email application an instant messaging application or some hybrid or variation of the two may be implemented with one or more application server modules . Similarly a search engine enabling users to search for and browse member profiles may be implemented with one or more application server modules . Of course other applications or services that utilize the pathfinder module may be separately embodied in their own application server modules .

In addition to the various application server modules the application logic layer includes the pathfinder module . As illustrated in with some embodiments the pathfinder module is implemented as a service that operates in conjunction with various application server modules . For instance any number of individual application server modules can invoke the functionality of the pathfinder module to include an application server module associated with a messaging application and or an application server module associated with an application to facilitate the viewing of member profiles. However with various alternative embodiments the pathfinder module may be implemented as its own application server module such that it operates as a stand alone application. With some embodiments the pathfinder module may include or have an associated publicly available application programming interface API that enables third party applications to invoke the functionality of the pathfinder module.

Generally the pathfinder module takes as input parameters that at a minimum identify two different nodes corresponding with two entities e.g. two persons or a person and a company etc. in a social graph that is implemented with a graph data structure e.g. social graph data . Using the input parameters the pathfinder module analyses the social graph data to identify the connection paths in the social graph that connect the two entities if any exist. With some embodiments additional input parameters may be provided to the pathfinder module and used to refine the connection paths selected for potential presentation to the user. These parameters include for example filtering criterion to include or exclude connection paths having particular entities or particular entity types or specific edge types. Once the set of connection paths satisfying the input parameters has been identified the pathfinder module derives a path score for each connection path for example by aggregating the individual edge scores for the edges that connect the different nodes included in the connection paths. Finally the pathfinder module provides the information corresponding with the connection paths to the application that invoked the pathfinder module so that a visual representation of one or more connection paths can be presented to the user.

The pathfinder module can be invoked from a wide variety of applications. In the context of a messaging application e.g. email application instant messaging application or some similar application the pathfinder module may be invoked to provide a message sender with a visual representation of a connection path between the message sender and a person to whom the message sender has addressed a message e.g. the message recipient . Similarly the pathfinder module may be invoked to provide a message sender with a visual representation of a connection path connecting an entity on whose behalf the message sender is acting e.g. company group or other organization with a message recipient. An example of such an embodiment of the invention is illustrated and described in connection with . In the context of an application that allows one to browse member profiles the pathfinder module may be invoked to present to the viewing user a connection path from the user to a target member whose profile is being viewed by the user. An example of such an embodiment of the invention is illustrated and described in connection with .

Referring to the table with reference number illustrates a non exhaustive list of associations that may be attributed to an edge connecting two nodes representing entities in the social graph data structure. Various edge types or associations may be applicable to all combinations of entity types while others may be applicable to only a certain subset of combinations of entity types. For example an edge type representing a following relationship may connect two nodes where each node represents a person and the edge connecting the two nodes indicates that one person is following the other. Similarly an edge representing a following relationship may connect a first node representing a person with a second node representing a company to indicate that the person is following the company. Accordingly the edge type for a following relationship applies to the entity type person as well as company. Some other associations are only meaningful when applied to an edge connecting certain types of entities.

Some of the various associations or edge types shown in indicate a particular relationship that exists between two entities represented by nodes in the graph data structure. For instance two members of the social network service may be directly connected one member may be following another one member may be in an address book or contacts list of another two members may be co managing a group or co inventors on a patent and so forth. In each of these examples the association or edge type is assigned to the edge connecting the two nodes representing the two entities e.g. person company educational institution group etc. 

Some of the various associations or edge types shown in indicate an activity that is shared in common between two entities or an activity that involves two entities. For example a first member may have communicated a message to a second member. A first member may have re tweeted or forwarded some content item e.g. a tweet that was originally generated by a second member. A first member may share an item of content with a second member or comment on an item of content posted by a second member and so forth.

A third category of associations generally involves what may be thought of as affiliations. For example a member may be affiliated with a company based on current or past employment at the company. A member may be affiliated with an educational institution based on current or past attendance as a student. A member may be affiliated with an online group based on membership in the group.

Another general category of associations or edge types involves what are referred to herein as affinities. For instance two members may be associated based on an affinity or similarity of profile attributes such as the same general geographic location skills shared in common employment in the same industry common degrees or majors etc. The various associations or edge types that may be assigned to an edge connecting two nodes in a graph data structure presented in are simply some of the many examples. In various alternative embodiments of the invention different associations not shown in may also be used particularly with embodiments of the invention that have additional entity types other than the specific examples presented herein e.g. person company educational institution group .

Referring again to there is an edge connecting Jane Smith to ACME Products Inc. which represents Jane s affiliation with ACME Products Inc. as the executive chairman and founder of the company. The score or weight assigned to this edge indicates the strength of this affiliation. For example with some embodiments the weight can be computed based on the overlap between Jane s network and the network of ACME Products Inc. where the node in the social graph representing ACME Products Inc. is connected to each member who is a current or former employee of the company. That is for a member M1 and a company C1 W M1 C1 Conn M1 C1 SQRT Conn M1 Conn C1 where W M1 C1 denotes the weight of the edge connecting M1 and C1 Conn M1 C1 denotes the number of members M1 is connected to who are also current or past employees of C1 Conn M1 denotes the total number of connections in M1 s network and Conn C1 denotes the total number of members who are current or past employees of C1. Similarly there is an edge connecting Jane Smith to State University which represents Jane s affiliation with State University as an alumnus of the university. The weight of this edge indicates the strength of this affiliation. For example the weight of an edge connecting a member M1 and a school S1 could be computed as W M1 S1 Conn M1 S1 Conn M1 where Conn M1 S1 denotes the number of members M1 is connected to who are also students or alumni of S1 and Conn M1 denotes the total number of member connections in M1 s network.

There is an edge connecting ACME Products Inc. with Widget Corp. which represents the association between the two companies. An association between two companies can exist for a variety of reasons for example if they share a common founder if some members of the social network service have been employed at both companies if one company is a subsidiary of the other or if the two companies are business partners. In this particular example ACME Products Inc. and Widget Corp. are connected because a large number of former Widget Corp. employees are currently employed with ACME Products Inc. The weight of the edge denotes the strength of the association. For example the weight of an edge connecting two companies C1 and C2 could be computed as W C1 C2 Conn C1 C2 SQRT Conn C1 Conn C2 where Conn C1 C2 denotes the number of members who have worked at both C1 and C2 and Conn C1 and Conn C2 denote the number of members who have worked at C1 and C2 respectively. Similarly there is an edge connecting ACME Products Inc. with State University which represents the association between the company and the school. This association can exist for a variety of reasons for example if graduates of the school or students at the school are employed by the company. Again the weight assigned to the edge indicates the strength of the association. For example the weight of an edge connecting a company C1 with a school S1 could be computed as W C1 S1 Conn C1 S1 SQRT Conn C1 Conn S1 where Conn C1 S1 denotes the number of members employed by company C1 who attend or have attended school S1 Conn C1 denotes the number of members employed by C1 and Conn S1 denotes the total number of members who attend or have attended S1.

In the example connection path with reference number the user represented by the node with reference number is directly connected to the member Fred Jones represented by the node with reference number . In turn Fred Jones is an employee of the same company e.g. ACME Products Inc. represented by the node with reference number at which the target member John Doe node with reference number is employed. Accordingly this example connection path involves two different node types e.g. a person and a company and two different edge types e.g. a direct connection and an employment relationship .

Given the various associations that may exist between entities for example as set forth in the table of it is readily apparent that in many instances there may be a significant number of connection paths connecting two persons or an entity e.g. a company with a person such that one or more of the connection paths may not be obvious or immediately apparent to the user. Furthermore as these two different example connection paths and make apparent the entity and edge types or associations involved in a particular connection path will often make one connection path more relevant with respect to a particular task or objective than another connection path. Accordingly with some embodiments of the invention after identifying a set of connection paths connecting a user with a target member or a user specified entity with a target member the pathfinder module will generate a path score for each connection path identified. With some embodiments the path score for each individual connection path will be dependent upon the individual edge scores assigned to the edges connecting the nodes in the connection path. With some embodiments of the invention different algorithms may be automatically used to derive path scores for different applications or tasks. The particular algorithm used to derive the path score may be automatically and dynamically selected for example based on a determination of what the user is attempting to achieve. Alternatively with some embodiments the user may make an explicit selection e.g. by specifying a type or category of message or a purpose for contacting someone which will then influence the algorithm used to derive the path scores. Consequently the edge scores or weights for different edge types may be derived differently for example to increase or decrease the influence of edge scores of certain types of edges on the path score depending upon the particular application that has invoked the pathfinder module or a particular task or process being undertaken or performed.

With some embodiments the application invoking the pathfinder module may filter the connection paths output by the pathfinder module or modify the scores or ordering of the connection paths by using additional methods or algorithms that customize the output of the pathfinder module for the needs of the particular application. For example an application that identifies intermediate members in a social network who may be able to introduce the user to a target member could adjust the scores of the intermediate members based on data concerning the historical or past activities undertaken by those members within the context of the social network service.

The presentation of the visual representation of the connection path or paths can vary significantly from one application to the next and from one embodiment of the invention to the next. Without any intent to limit the scope of what is claimed present various examples of user interfaces that convey a visual representation of connection paths in a social graph connecting a user with a target member consistent with some embodiments of the invention. These example user interfaces represent user interface elements that might be used in any type of application to present contextual information concerning a connection path between a user and another member of a social network service.

As illustrated in the example user interface shows a visual representation of three different connection paths having an equal number of nodes e.g. entities and the same type of edges e.g. association . Specifically in this example the user represented by YOU has seven direct connections e.g. person to person relationships established via the social network service that are also directly connected to the target member . Of those seven connections three are visually presented in the user interface element while the other four are accessible to the user via the button or link corresponding with the text SEE 4 MORE. With some embodiments when multiple connection paths exist with the same number of nodes and the same edge types all or a specific subset of the connection paths may be presented in parallel as shown in . Generally the order in which the connection paths are presented will be dependent upon the connection strength as indicated by the path score derived for the various connection paths. For instance in the example of the connection path including the node with reference number is presumed to be a stronger or more relevant connection path than the connection path including the node with reference number .

While the connection paths associated with the user interface element of involve a direct connection as an edge type the visual representation of the connection paths corresponding with involve an employment relationship with a company. Specifically the user interface element shown in indicates that the user represented by the point with reference number has three people in his broader network e.g. within the social graph who are connected to the target member and who were at one time or another employed with the same company at which the user and the target member e.g. Peter Quick with reference number were at one time employed. In this example the company e.g. Support Soft. is represented by the user interface element with reference number while the individual members and thus the separate connection paths and are represented by the user interface elements with reference numbers and . In this particular example as indicated by the textual descriptions positioned next to each user interface element that corresponds with a node from the social graph the members forming the connection path to the target member are second level or second degree connections of the user . With some embodiments the user may interact with the individual user interface elements for example by manipulating a cursor control device or interacting with a touch sensitive display to select or hover over a user interface element causing additional information to be presented. The additional information may include information concerning the various first level or first degree connections who the user shares in common with the members represented by the user interface elements with reference numbers and forming the connection paths with the target member as shown in .

The particular user interfaces shown in and are simply examples of how a connection path may be conveyed in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. The particular examples might be used as a portion of a user interface for any number of different applications. Other embodiments of the invention may use visual representations of the connection path that differ from those shown in and . Specifically with some embodiments a visual representation of a connection path may not include any parallel paths but instead each individual connection path may be shown as a series of nodes representing different entities. With some embodiments only a subset of the nodes in a particular connection path may be visually represented. Alternatively with some embodiments each and every node in a connection path is included in the visual representation.

People s relationships are one primary kind of knowledge available on social network services. For example in the physical world there are varieties of relationships such as friends colleagues acquaintances and the like and these relationships are also online in member profiles of social network services such as Facebook LinkedIn or Google . Relationship mining on social network services is becoming important. Such mining may use latent information as opposed to explicit relationships i.e. in explicit relationships one has background knowledge to follow in addition to the data uncovered from the target relationship. For example people can discover advisor advisee relationships in an academic collaboration network using the background knowledge of the properties of publication and collaboration records. Given the publication and collaboration records of two authors a guess can be made with high probability whether the one author is the other s student based on background knowledge of academic training. However in many practical cases there are no such explicit clues. The relationships are latent when there is little or no background knowledge. For example on the professional social networking system managers may have connections with their employees. Although this manager employee relationship exists of the social network inferring it is extremely difficult. Due to its latent nature none of the features like connections job titles working experiences explicitly indicate working relationships directly. Furthermore the relationship can be hierarchical such as in an organization chart. For example from pairwise manager employee relationship we can build the organization structure of a whole company can be built. However hierarchy construction from local pairwise relationship prediction tends to be a challenging problem. But latent social relationships can be inferred and used to construct hierarchy from heterogeneous data sources using concepts in physics to design a force based schema to integrate the information from heterogeneous sources harmonically to predict the pairwise latent relationship. Use may be made of the objective entanglement strength and subjective coherence strength concepts to capture the latent relationships from objective and subjective perspectives. These features may then be used to compute local probability of a latent relationship. A local probabilistic function may be designed based on the physics principle of escape velocity. Then a global hierarchy such as an organization chart may be constructed using a Reduced Markov Decision Process RMDP which utilizes local pairwise relationships.

In social networks a relationship may be said to be latent when there is no background knowledge about the relationship in addition to the data that helps in inferring the relationship itself. On a professional social network system a manager employee relationship is latent. Given the job titles and personal connections of two professionals in the same company it is very difficult if not impossible to make a confident guess on whether one person is the other s manager since there is no background knowledge about the relationship between the two. Job titles are supplied by users which could be different even for the same or a similar job. For example a person doing data mining job in a company could represent him herself as data miner software engineer data specialist data scientist or data person . It is very rare for a person to have a title like software engineer on data mining in company A and another person to have a title like manager of software engineer of data mining in company A. Further the order of joining a company is not a good indicator either. A person joining earlier could not necessarily be another person s manager. Also there are usually no publication records in a professional social network service. We cannot see things like project collaboration history of people. Given that as a fact there is no direct way to tell whether two people have worked on anything together before. This illustrates a lack of background knowledge in a social network service.

The insight to solving problems in social network research sometimes lies in physics. For example if nodes of a social graph are treated as stars the social network service is like the universe. The interactions between nodes are like forces between planets. The latent relationship between two nodes share common properties with the escape velocity between a star and a planet. The relationships are asymmetric. The escape velocities are different depending on whether it is a star escaping form a planet or a planet from a star. Likewise the relationship of members in a social network service is asymmetric. For example the probability of member A being member B s manager is different from the probability of member B being member A s manager. Further they both depend on nodes properties whether it is mass difference in the planetary example or seniority or capability difference in the social network example. Also the distances among nodes whether in the universe or a social network have impact on relationships interactions among them. Therefore the concept of escape velocity can be used to model the latent relationship.

On a social network even though it may be known that there is the manager employee relationship within a manager s connections which of the manager s connections are those employees is not known directly. However the fact that employees do not explicitly mark themselves as the working relationships cannot stop others treating them as if they work together. For example if the general users often view the person A and her particular connection B together which may be called co viewing it is an objective indication that A and B probably share something in common. If they work for the same company they may have fairly strong working relationship or job similarity. Therefore even if the relationship is latent with no explicit marks A and B are entangled together by the objective opinion of general users. is an example of objective entanglement. People who viewed President Obama s profile on a professional social network also viewed Governor Romney s and Secretary of State Clinton s profiles with high frequencies. The latter two are entangled with President Obama by public opinion. Therefore a feature that is useful for inferring latent relationship is objective entanglement strength.

Objective entanglement strength may be expressed mathematically as the Objective Entanglement Strength OES between entity x and y is O x y . OES quantifies the objective similarity of x and y. Objective entanglement is a phenomenon of a small group of people being recognized as closely related to each other by the general crowd. illustrates this point. Without heavily investigating their other information and using only the intelligence of the crowd there is an indication that the latent relationship exists with higher probability between A and B than B and C.

There are customized ways to quantify the OES for user pairs for different scenario. Item based collaborative filtering to generate a score of objective entangled strength to measure how a pair of users entangles from objective perspective. Collaborative filtering is essentially based on co view data.

To reduce the computation cost and maintain the utility for our model we only compute the OES score for directly connected nodes that are within the same company. cos 

Besides objective clues subjective clues are also valuable for latent relationship discovery. Subjective coherence of a group of people is the relationship strength that is formed voluntary by themselves. There are two such subjective coherences that could be used for the social network service.

Subjective coherence strength SCS for a pair of nodes x and y may be written as S x y which quantifies subjective closeness between x and y. When people connect to each other on a social network they choose their connections based on their subjective preference. Therefore the connections reflect their real social relationship to some extent. For example on a professional networking scenario people make connections based on their careers. If a group of people are well connected e.g. their connection forms a complete graph they have a higher chance of having similar job functions. If they are from the same company they are probably co workers. illustrates such an example. It is the connection graph of a company where different shades mark different communities such as Engineering Operations Human resources and the like which happen to have different job functions. Thus people are geologically close to others who are their co workers in this type of graph. Since the connection graph is subjectively formed subjective coherent strength to may be used to measure how close people are.

One way to capture the SCS between two nodes is to use the distance between them. Since each connection is subjectively formed nodes distance is a natural measure of their closeness. The Yifan Hu graph layout method may be used compute the subjective coherence strength. The algorithm is a multi layer force based graph drawing method and has been widely implemented in computation and graph visualization tools. This can be seen in more detail in the paper by Yifan Hu Wolfram Research Inc. Champaign Ill. 61820. That paper which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety may also be found at http www2.research.att.com yifanhu PUB graph draw small.pdf.

One example of the algorithm may be Algorithm 2 beginning at page 17 of that paper. Originally the objective of the Yifan Hu algorithm was to come up with an arrangement of nodes and edges for a graph so that the layout of it is aesthetic i.e. node communities are clear and edge overlaps are minimum. illustrates the advantages of the Yifan Hu layout over a random layout. The Yifan Hu layout is a better reflection of network structures as well as a fast method that suits large graphs. The algorithm produces two dimensional coordinates for nodes and may be used to compute node distances using a Euclidean scheme. Such distance measure is a good indicator of the closeness of working relationships and is finer grained than shortest path distance and reflecting more structural information than the random walk commute distance. As a further explanation may be generated from the entire professional social network connection data set using the Yifan Hu algorithm. The purpose of is to illustrate that the relation strength can somehow capture job functions. and are generated on the same connection data set for example a part of the professional social network s connections . The layout of is randomly generated whereas the layout of is generated by the Yifan Hu algorithm. The purpose of these two figures is to demonstrate that the Yifan Hu approach can effectively represent relation strength whereas random layout may fail.

However people that are far from each other do not necessarily have different job functions. So attempting to determine a company s entire connection graph from distance alone would give inaccurate results. The reason for that is the whole graph distance calculation could dilute the force of surrounding nodes for every node. When considering the force among a node and its neighbors many neighbor nodes are pulled away by their own neighbors communities. To resolve this distances for nodes may be more reliably computed by using what may be called their ego network.

The above may be viewed as meaning that for every node u in the social network service its ego network is extracted and may be used as input to the force based graph layout algorithm to get meaningful distance between u and its neighbors. Such distances are one type of representation of subjective coherence strength.

The above features that have been obtained can indicate the latent relationship to some extent but are not powerful enough to be a clear identifier and may be integrated in a more meaningful representation of the target latent relationship.

Even if connections have subjective coherence strength among each other some have more potential than others as a help in inferring an organization chart from the connections. Therefore the connections may be refined by selecting a candidate subset that has really good potential to have the latent relationship be very useful for inferring the organization chart. This may be performed by using member supplied job title similarity to do the candidate selection. Although as indicated earlier member supplied titles may be inaccurate there include some useful clues. For example if one titles herself as data scientist and the other intern in data mining the two persons should have similar job functions and maybe even be on the same team. illustrates persons having similar job functions in their profiles on a social network service. Therefore pairwise job title similarity may be usefully computed. For this purpose the Jaccard similarity measure may be used for the computation with the computation being for one company at a time instead of on the whole social network. The title similarity is defined as the following the same as the Jaccard index.

Given u and v pairwise latent relationship probability may be defined as p uv . First of all p uv is asymmetric. p uv p vu . The reason is because the latent relationship is hierarchical. Similarly and as discussed above the OES and SCS between u and v are also asymmetric. In other words OES u v OES v u and SCS u v SCS v u . The pairwise latent relationship probability should be a meaningful integration of both subjective and objective features obtained thus far. Subjective coherence gives relationship distance and objective entanglement is like the gravity force attracting two nodes. They may be combined using the escape velocity discussed above as a good indicator of such. For an object to escape a gravitational field the escape velocity is the minimum speed needed without further propulsion. When p uv is computed i.e. the chance that u is v s manager in the above domain application case u may be considered in the social network service to be a gravitational field or a planet and v to be a surrounding object that is escaping. This is illustrated in where the escape velocity of v is V. The escape velocity of v captures the influence of u on v. In another words if v needs a larger velocity to escape from u u has higher chance to be v s close co worker or manager. The escape velocity also captures asymmetry well i.e. u s escape velocity from planet v is different from planet v s escape velocity from u.

The pairwise local probability for latent relationship considers only a target node and all its direct surroundings. It captures only a 1 hop relationship. Getting the pairwise relationship probability estimation is the starting point rather than final destination for a global hierarchy construction. First pairwise latent relationship estimation is not accurate enough. For example in the manager employee relationship discovery problem one person usually has only one direct report manager. For a person u and the manager candidate set if we choose arg max as the final prediction result of u s manager we would have mis assignments at the pairwise level. Stated another way the equation denotes the selection of user v which has the highest local probability of being user u s manager as the predicted manager. Furthermore from the inaccurate pairwise level the construction of the global hierarchy e.g. the organization chart in the current application will be even further from the true structure.

To address this a global hierarchy construction algorithm may be designed with a two fold goal. First the mis arrangement of pairwise latent relationship may be corrected by utilizing global structure information. Further the global structure should benefit in accuracy from the improved local prediction.

There are two types of correction that may be used with the help of additional information from the data Type I correction and Type II correction.

Type I correction is the peer correction. If a team is reasonably well organized in the raw data it is very likely to be discovered by the local prediction scheme as close co workers tend to be close in the local results. If there is one mis inference and the majority of the other co workers manager are predicted right the mis inference can be corrected. shows arrow is likely to be reassigned given its co workers assignments.

Type II correction uses more global structure information. Type II correction may be called efficiency correction. The intuition is that in an efficient working environment the organization chart paths from every employee to the CEO should be as short as possible. Therefore we could measure the shortest path between a node and the CEO node. For example locally A may be closer to B than C. However B is a lot further to the CEO than C. In a global setting A should choose C for a shorter path to the CEO node. The two types of corrections lead to a design of the global structure construction algorithm.

There is another piece of information which may be particularly useful for hierarchy mining. Title seniority is an important factor in inferring people s hierarchy. For example a person with a title software engineer manager is almost certainly more senior than a person with a title software engineer intern . Therefore after we identify close co workers such seniority is important to discover the hierarchy. However seniority also has drawbacks to prevent or highly recommend against applying seniority directly to predict pairwise latent relation. The major problem is that such seniority is very noisy. For example a person may have multiple jobs simultaneously. Therefore it is often inaccurate to directly infer seniority from user supplied titles or positions and it is also inaccurate to infer seniority from other sources of information such as connections in a professional social network service. Nevertheless seniority may be used as an important feature. illustrates members of a social network service showing seniority of co workers. In Daniel Tunkelang appears to have more seniority than Monica Rogati and Dania Sorokina. Like other noisy yet important features title may be integrated seniority with other information to make a good component for hierarchy construction. Table 1 lists one example of organized seniorities and the relative number values assigned to them.

As discussed there are two factors i.e. the pairwise probability and their seniority affecting the latent relationship prediction. The global hierarchy construction may be modelled as a random process with rewards. The local pairwise latent relationship prediction result may provide a graph where each node represents a person and each edge connects a person and his or her manager candidate with a weight prediction probability . The objective is to derive a generated tree from the graph which is most likely to be the real hierarchy in this case the organization chart with the CEO as the root of the tree. Given this setting the hierarchy construction process can be treated as a random walk on the graph. Each node could be a state in the random process and each directed weighted edge represents the transit probability between two states. The seniority differences between two nodes can represent the reward for moving between the two states . Therefore the construction phase may be converted to a random process with rewards. A Markov Decision Process MDP may be used as a good model for capturing the problem. The general idea of MDP is a Markov chain with actions and rewards. It is a simulation of a decision making process with random probabilities and the decision maker s actions. The MDP may be formulated for the above case as follows.

The reward R for assigning x s manager to be y is related to the difference of their seniorities. Ideally one s manager s seniority is the smallest value that is larger than one s own seniority. However in reality the case is really different because of the data quality issue that discussed previously. When one s seniority is mis generated there may be the case where a manager s seniority is the same or even lower than the employee s seniority value. To tolerate such a scenario and also capture the real value of seniority in the model a reward function for assigning y to be x s manager may be defined as follows. 

The above function r x y is seen to be maximized when y is 1 level senior than x. The reward value decreases sharply to other situations. illustrates the shape of the reward function r x y .

The objective function of such a MDP is to maximize the rewards given the transition probability P and action a. More formally it is 

To solve a MDP reinforced learning and dynamic programming are usually suitable tools. However since a reduced MDP is used a more efficient way to solve it may be formulated. The algorithm for this may involve two parts merging the reward and transitional probability and the computing single source shortest path.

As there is no explicit difference of actions the chance of getting a reward r x y is to go along the path with probability p xy . Therefore the expected gain is simply r x y p xy . The real world meaning of this in the application under discussion is that by assigning y to be x s manager the confidence is p xy and if the assignment is beneficial for the whole global structure the reward is r x y . There is a trade off with respect to different combinations of rewards and probabilities. A high reward but low probability state should not be chosen if the expected value is low. Therefore our objective is to generate a tree structure that maximizes the expected reward.

Every time a pairwise latent relationship is discovered it contributes a little bit to the global hierarchy. In the organization chart mining problem the final organization chart is built by all pairwise manager employee relationships. As discussed above the organization chart structure is more efficient if it contains only the shortest paths from every employee to the CEO. Following this heuristic combined with the merged reward and transitional probability approach the reduced MDP problem may be solved using a single source shortest path SSSP algorithm. In our case the CEO node is the source in a company graph. With the expected gain as the weight of an edge we can use SSSP to generate the shortest path tree which is the globally optimized hierarchy structure.

Our framework involves several expensive computation tasks such as large scale collaborative filtering and node distance calculation on large graph. The big data generated by real world social network application also make the computation more challenging. Therefore to provide efficiency of compotation a combination of a platform and a single machine paradigm may be used. A system for implementing an embodiment is illustrated in . The social network service is seen at and includes member profiles. Collaborative filtering is used to generate a score of objective entangled strength to measure how pairs of users entangle from objective perspective. Ego networks of members 1 through N at through which are then used as input to the force based graph layout algorithm which produces two dimensional coordinates for nodes and may be used to compute Subjective Coherence Strength as node distances using a Euclidean scheme. In one embodiment the graph layout algorithm is the Yihan Hu algorithm discussed above. The modules and may be implemented on a Hadoop platform with N nodes which may be operated offline. The other modules are implemented in a single server with M CPU and MGB physical memory. Pairwise latent relationship probability is calculated at and used as input to the reduced MDP process described above to calculate the latent relation hierarchy or organization chart.
