A healthcare provider working within a patient healthcare application on a computing device typically desires access to additional content that helps the provider to better understand the information being presented by the application. For example the provider may wish to access a differential diagnosis list associated with a set of patient symptoms. Traditional solutions to this problem require the provider to select for example the set of patient symptoms in the application. Selection of the symptoms may navigate the provider to another application where for instance a differential diagnosis list is presented. The provider must then close out of this application in order to return to the patient healthcare application. This navigation process disrupts the provider s train of thought and requires the provider to re focus on the information presented by the healthcare application before proceeding.

Another problem associated with typical patient healthcare applications is the presentation of alerts or action items. Alerts such as alerts regarding medication refills or drug drug interactions are often presented as pop ups in the healthcare application and require the provider to take some type of action in order to dismiss the pop up. The use of pop ups to alert the provider to potential problems or action items also disrupts the provider s train of thought and requires the provider to re focus his or her attention on the application once the pop up is addressed and dismissed.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The present invention is defined by the claims.

In brief and at a high level this disclosure describes among other things methods systems and computer readable media for dynamically determining and presenting actionable content items that are contextually relevant to and augment information associated with an open healthcare application. The content items are presented in a non disruptive manner such as for example in a sidebar that is displayed simultaneously with the application user interface. The content items dynamically flex and update in response to changes in the information currently being displayed by the healthcare application. Examples of content items may include alerts patient entered information content provided by content providers action items and the like. Presenting dynamic and actionable content items in a sidebar to an existing application enables the provider to view and act on the content items at the provider s convenience. This stands in contrast to the traditional presentation of alerts as pop ups or the necessity of having to open and close other applications to access needed information both of which disrupt the provider s train of thought and can hamper patient care.

The subject matter of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. However the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover although the terms step and or block may be used herein to connote different elements of methods employed the terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods systems and computer readable media for determining and presenting actionable content items that are contextually relevant to patient information associated with a healthcare application. The content items are generated by monitoring information associated with the healthcare application including what information is currently being displayed by the healthcare application. Content related to the monitored information is retrieved from content providers. Additionally information stored in association with the patient s electronic medical record EMR is accessed to identify patient information related to the monitored information and or related to the content retrieved from the content providers. The patient information accessed from the EMR and the content retrieved from the content providers are presented in a non disruptive manner as actionable content items.

The content items may include such things as alerts patient entered information action items content provided by content providers such as differential diagnosis lists decision support schemas and various clinical tools and the like. As mentioned the content items are actionable. Interaction with a content item can initiate clinical orders or order sets add information to the patient s EMR address alerts and the like. As well interaction with a content item can affect changes to the information being presented by the healthcare application and interaction with the information being presented by the healthcare application can affect changes to the content items. By way of example a provider can import a content item or portions of a content item such as a patient entered review of systems into a summary note in the healthcare application. In another example a provider can highlight or tag information in the healthcare application and initiate the presentation of an actionable content item in the sidebar that is related to the tagged information. The actionable content item enables the provider to initiate an action related to the tagged information. The interaction between the content items and the information presented in the healthcare application helps the provider to provide improved care to his or her patients. In addition the content items dynamically flex and update in response to new information being displayed by the healthcare application and or in response to user actions.

It will be understood that the components and illustrated in are exemplary in nature and in number and should not be construed as limiting. Any number of components may be employed to achieve the desired functionality within the scope of embodiments hereof.

The monitoring component is configured to monitor patient information associated with a healthcare application being executed on for example the end user computing device . The types of healthcare applications are numerous but representative examples may include documentation applications workflow applications ordering applications summary pages and the like. The content items service is configured for use in association with any type of healthcare application. In one aspect the patient information that is associated with the healthcare application may be customized based on the patient the identity of the provider accessing the application and the role associated with that provider e.g. physician versus nurse the healthcare venue or healthcare facility associated with the patient s care e.g. inpatient versus ambulatory conditions associated with the patient e.g. diabetes hypertension pregnancy and the like and by type of visit e.g. new patient follow up well patient admission transfer discharge and the like . The monitoring component is configured to take into account not only the patient the provider the provider role the venue patient conditions and type of visit when monitoring information associated with the healthcare application but also what information is currently being displayed by the healthcare application user interface and in what context the information is being presented. For example the monitoring component is configured to identify that a Labs section is currently being displayed by the application and what type of labs are being shown in this section.

The monitoring component is further configured to monitor any updates to the information associated with the application. This may include updated information concerning the provider the provider role the venue patient conditions and type of visit. The updated information may also include changes to information currently being displayed by the healthcare application. For example instead of healthcare application currently displaying the labs section discharge information may currently be displayed by the application.

The monitoring component is also configured to monitor information associated with the healthcare facility caring for the patient. For instance the monitoring component is configured to monitor antibiotic resistance patterns associated with the facility medications carried by the facility s formulary best practices implemented by the facility and the like.

The monitoring component is additionally configured to monitor provider interactions with the healthcare application and with content items in order to determine preferences associated with the provider. Exemplary provider interactions associated with the healthcare application may include frequently placed orders or order sets terminology or phrases frequently used in clinical notes and frequently taken actions. Exemplary provider interactions associated with content items may include dismissing certain content items re prioritizing content items in a certain order types of actions selected by the provider with respect to certain content items and the like. Provider preferences may be derived from the provider interactions and stored in association with the data store .

The identifying component is configured to identify and retrieve content from the content provider that is related or contextually relevant to the information associated with the healthcare application. The content may be retrieved from the data store or directly from the content provider . The identifying component may employ for instance a universal application programming interface API to retrieve the content from the content provider . The API may be modified and or extended by various wrappers and translators customized or standard that are specific to the particular content provider. The content may include differential diagnosis lists decision support algorithms healthcare facility specific standards of care or quality initiatives clinical tools such as clinical calculators and the like.

The identifying component is also configured to access the patient s EMR and identify patient information including patient entered information that is relevant to the information associated with the healthcare application and or relevant to information retrieved from the content provider . Examples of patient entered information may include patient entered questions patient entered responses to questions patient entered review of systems patient entered diet or exercise logs patient entered history and the like.

The identifying component is further configured to access the patient s EMR to identify any alerts and or actions items related to the information associated with the healthcare application and or the content retrieved from the content provider . Exemplary alerts may comprise medication refill alerts drug interaction alerts allergy alerts order alerts and the like. The identifying component is also configured to identify a level associated with the alert. For instance some alerts may be informational and of low priority while other alerts may be warning alerts or patient safety alerts having a higher priority.

The determining component is configured to utilize at least the patient information identified by the identifying component from the patient s EMR as well as the content identified and retrieved by the identifying component from the content provider to determine actionable content items that are contextually relevant to the information associated with the healthcare application. The actionable content items are subsequently rendered for display in a display space associated with the healthcare application user interface by the rendering component .

Different content items may be determined by the determining component based on the patient information from the patient s EMR as well as the content from the content provider . For example the determining component may utilize patient entered information to determine and generate a patient entered review of systems content item a patient entered exercise or diet log content item a patient entered questions content item a patient entered response to question content item and the like. Similarly the determining component may utilize patient information in the EMR to determine and generate alert content items and action content items. Content from content providers may be used by the determining component to determine and generate a differential diagnosis content item a quality initiative content item a decision support content item a clinical calculator content item and the like. Each of the content items determined by the determining component is related to or relevant to the information associated with the healthcare application including the information currently being displayed by the healthcare application.

The determining component is further configured to determine actions associated with the content items where the type of action is dependent upon the type of content item and or learned provider preferences. For example actions associated with a medication refill content item may include Refill and Dismiss. Actions associated with a patient entered review of systems content item may include Import and Dismiss. Selection of the Import option imports the patient entered information or a portion of the patient entered information into for example a document presented by the healthcare application such as a summary note. This will be explained in greater depth below. Actions associated with order content items may include Add or Dismiss. Additional actions associated with content items may include the ability to select information within the content item and be directed to supporting documentation associated with the selected information.

The determining component is configured to prioritize content items based on for example relevance to information currently being displayed by the healthcare application urgency status and or based on preferences associated with the provider utilizing the healthcare application. Content items that may no longer be relevant to information currently presented by the healthcare application may be presented lower in the content item list may be partially collapsed or may not be presented in the display space. With respect to provider preferences if a provider consistently dismisses certain content items these content items may be presented lower in the content item list as compared to other content items be partially collapsed or may not be presented in the display space.

The determining component is additionally configured to dynamically update the content items in response to updated information associated with the healthcare application. As used throughout this disclosure the term dynamically means occurring in near real time. As mentioned above the updated information associated with the healthcare application may include changes to the provider the provider role the venue or healthcare facility patient conditions or type of visit. As well the updated information may include changes to the information currently being displayed by the healthcare application. In response to the updated information the determining component may generate new content items re prioritize existing content items or modify content associated with existing content items. Content items that are less relevant with respect to the updated information may be placed lower in the content item list partially collapsed or not be presented in the display space.

In one aspect the rendering component may render content items in a separate sidebar element to the left or to the right of the healthcare application user interface. In other embodiments the content items may be presented in a separate display space positioned at the top or the bottom of the healthcare application user interface. Additionally the content items may be presented as an overlay on existing content being presented by the application or in line to an item of information presented by the healthcare application. Any and all such variations and any combination thereof are contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.

Content items that are time sensitive such as medication refills may be highlighted by the rendering component in some manner to help draw the user s attention to the content items. Additionally alert content items may be highlighted in different manners according to the level of the alert e.g. informational versus warning versus patient safety . Highlighting may be accomplished by coloring the content item differently than other content items using different font placing the content item higher in the priority queue making the content item appear to glow associating an audible sound such as a beep or ping with the content item and the like.

Turning now to these figures depict exemplary graphical user interfaces GUIs displaying exemplary content items related to information associated with a healthcare application. With respect to depicts an exemplary GUI that includes a healthcare application and its associated user interface accessed by a provider Jan Carter M.D. for a patient Charles Adams . Besides identifying the provider and provider role and the patient the healthcare application also includes information identifying the healthcare venue and the type of visit follow up ambulatory and conditions associated with the patient hypertension hyperlipidemia and diabetes . As shown in the healthcare application is currently displaying information such as lab results for the condition of diabetes .

The GUI further includes a display space . In one aspect the display space is presented simultaneously with the healthcare application as a separate sidebar element. Although depicts the display space as a separate sidebar to the right of the healthcare application it is also contemplated that the display space may be presented as a left sidebar or as a separate display space positioned at the top or the bottom of the healthcare application . In another aspect the display space may be presented as an overlay to the healthcare application. With respect to this aspect the entire display space may be presented as an overlay on content associated with the healthcare application. Alternatively individual content items may be presented as an overlay on content associated with the healthcare application. Further when presented as an overlay the display space and or the individual content items may be presented for a predetermined period of time before fading or disappearing. In one aspect the display space and or content items may be minimized via a user action or automatically upon determining that the content item s is no longer relevant to information currently being presented by the healthcare application. In yet another aspect the content items may be presented in line within the healthcare application . For example a medication refill content item may be presented in line with the listed medication in the healthcare application . Any and all such variations and any combination thereof are contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.

The display space includes a number of content items and that are related to the information associated with the healthcare application . The content item is a differential diagnosis list provided by a third party content provider. The differential diagnosis content item is contextually relevant to the patient the lab results currently being shown by the healthcare application to the provider and provider role physician as well as to the diabetes condition . The differential diagnosis content item is displayed automatically and without human intervention which helps the provider to maintain consistency in his or her workflow without having to navigate to a separate application to access the differential diagnosis information or be disrupted by a pop up with the differential diagnosis information.

The content item comprises a medication refill content item for the diabetes medication Metformin. The medication refill content item is relevant to the patient the role associated with the provider and the diabetes condition . For example the medication refill content item would not typically be displayed to a nurse since the nurse could not act on the refill order. The medication refill content item includes a Refill action and a Dismiss action. If the provider selects the Refill action the order is automatically initiated and stored in the patient s EMR. If the provider selects the Dismiss action the content item is either dismissed from the display space or moved lower in the priority queue.

The content item comprises a content item for diabetes patient education. The diabetes patient education content item is related to the patient the diabetes condition and the provider role. Diabetes patient education may be part of a healthcare facility s standard of care or quality initiative and thus a diabetes education content item may be automatically generated by for example the content items service of upon identifying from the healthcare application that the patient suffers from diabetes. The diabetes patient education content item includes the actions Add and Dismiss. By selecting the Add action diabetes patient information will be added to a list of education items to be provided to the patient . Additionally by selecting the Add action the provider may also be able to initiate a specific order or order set related to diabetes. By selecting the Dismiss action the provider can dismiss the content item as explained above with respect to the medication refill content item .

The content item comprises a patient entered response to a question. In this case the question requested that the patient select the problem to be addressed by the current visit. The patient selected the problem of high blood pressure. As seen the content item is related to the patient the provider and provider role the venue and type of visit and the information currently being displayed by the healthcare application e.g. medications for hypertension . Presentation of the content item helps to ensure effective communication between the provider and the patient regarding the patient s care. For example if the current visit was actually for the cholesterol problem and not for high blood pressure presentation of the content item in the display space provides an opportunity for the provider to educate the patient about the purpose of the current visit.

The information presented by the healthcare application and the content items presented in the display space are closely interrelated and interaction with one may cause changes to the other. For example as shown in the provider is able to tag information in the healthcare application . Numeral indicates information that has been tagged or highlighted by the user. The tagged information is then presented as a content item in the display space . The content item enables the provider to initiate actions with respect to the tagged information . In this example the provider has tagged information related to the patient s smoking history. The content item comprises a set of orders related to smoking cessation. The orders may be based on past smoking cessation order sets submitted by the provider and stored as provider preferences in a data store such as the data store of . The orders may also be based on standards of care or quality initiatives associated with the healthcare facility caring for the patient . The actions associated with the content item include an Add All action and a Dismiss action. The Add All action allows the provider to initiate the complete order set with one click. Additional content items may also be generated based on the tagged information . For instance content items may be generated that enable the provider to incorporate the tagged information into a problem list or to add smoking cessation education to the patient s education list.

Content items may also be presented upon determining that for example a document associated with the healthcare application includes new information that has not yet been stored in discrete structure fields in the patient s EMR. For example the discharge summary includes item where the provider documented that the patient has a sedentary lifestyle. Upon determining that this information is not part of the patient s EMR a content item is generated and displayed in the display space . The content item includes the action Add that enables the provider to add Lack of Physical Exercise to the patient s problem list stored in association with the patient s EMR. Alternatively the provider can choose to dismiss the content item .

Turning to the healthcare application is continuing to present the discharge summary. However a new set of content items is being presented in the display space . Content item comprises a patient entered content item by which the provider can access the patient s diet and exercise log . Ready access to this type information enables the provider to prepare a complete discharge summary. Content item comprises a patient entered review of systems. In this case only positive findings are shown. The provider can interact with the content item and select for example the patient s indication that he is having Difficulty Swallowing . Actions associated with the content item include Import and Dismiss. Upon the provider s selection of the Import action the finding is imported into for example the healthcare application . This is shown in . depicts the healthcare application displaying a Review of Systems screen. The finding Difficulty Swallowing has been imported into the review of systems and re labeled by its correct medical term Dysphagia . The translation of the term Difficulty Swallowing to the term Dysphagia may be carried out by a third party nomenclature service.

The display space in also is presenting content item . The content item can be considered a clean up content item in that it prompts the provider to complete a one or more items prior to closing out of the healthcare application . The content item may be generated upon determining that for example a note has not yet been documented for the current patient visit. The content item includes a Create Note action. Selection of this action directs the provider to the appropriate section of the healthcare application so that the provider can prepare the note. Other clean up content items may include alert reminder content items charge documentation content items electronic signature reminder content items and the like.

Turning now to depicts a flow diagram of an exemplary method of dynamically determining content items to be displayed in a display space that is presented in conjunction with a healthcare application. At a step information associated with the healthcare application is monitored by a monitoring component such as the monitoring component of . Examples of monitored information include patient name user actions patient conditions provider name provider role venue or healthcare facility caring for the patient type of visit and what information is currently being displayed to the provider by the healthcare application. Monitoring may also include detecting any changes or updates to the information associated with the healthcare application such as for example a change in the information currently being displayed to the provider by the healthcare application changes to patient conditions provider role type of visit and the like.

At a step an identifying component such as the identifying component of identifies and retrieves content from content providers that is relevant to the monitored information. Content providers may include third party content providers that are independent of the healthcare facility providing care to the patient. Content providers may also include the healthcare facility itself. Examples of content retrieved from the content providers include decision support algorithms condition based practice models quality initiatives differential diagnosis lists clinical tools such as clinical calculators standards of care and the like.

At a step the patient s EMR is accessed by the identifying component to identify patient information including patient entered information that is relevant to the monitored information associated with the healthcare application and or relevant to the content retrieved from the content providers. Examples of patient information accessed from the EMR may include outstanding alerts patient entered questions current diagnoses predisposing conditions responses to questions exercise and or diet logs review of systems and the like.

At a step a determining component such as the determining component of utilizes the patient information identified from the patient s EMR and the content retrieved from the content providers to determine and generate content items and actions associated with the content items. Additional information may also be utilized when generating content items. For example the determining component may access a data store such as the data store of to determine preferences associated with the provider. Provider preferences in turn may be used to customize the content of the content items to the particular provider prioritize the content items in a particular order highlight the content items in a particular way customize the actions associated with the content items and the like. At a step the determined content items are then rendered for display by for example a rendering component such as the rendering component of .

The generated content items are contextually relevant to the information associated with the healthcare application and are presented in a non obtrusive manner such as in a sidebar or as an overlay to the healthcare application user interface. The content items may be actionable. For example the provider is able to interact with the content items to address alerts initiate orders import information from the content items into the healthcare application view supporting documentation add information to the patient s EMR navigate to different sections of the healthcare application modify information in the healthcare application and the like.

The content items dynamically update in response to for example changes in the information associated with the healthcare application such as changes to the information currently being displayed by the healthcare application as well as to changes in content provided by the content providers or to changes in the patient s medical information as stored in the patient s EMR. Content items may be updated by modifying content associated with existing content items adding new content items re prioritizing content items highlighting content items removing content items that are no longer relevant to the healthcare application and the like.

As seen the present invention is directed to the presentation of dynamic actionable content items that augment information associated with a healthcare application. The content items are presented in a non distracting manner such as in a sidebar to the healthcare application user interface. The provider using the healthcare application can address the content items at his or her convenience without the necessity of having to stop the current workflow and navigate to different applications and or address disruptive pop ups.

The present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments which are intended in all respects to be illustrative rather than restrictive. Further the present invention is not limited to these embodiments but variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
