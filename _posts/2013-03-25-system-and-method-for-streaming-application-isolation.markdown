title: System and method for streaming application isolation
abstract: Providing streaming of one or more applications from streaming servers onto one or more clients. The computer readable medium includes computer-executable instructions for execution by a processing system. The applications are contained within one or more isolated environments, and the isolated environments are streamed from the servers onto clients. The system may include authentication of the streaming servers and authentication of clients and credentialing of the isolated environments and applications the clients are configured to run. The system may include encrypted communication between the streaming servers and the clients. The system may further include a management interface where administrators may add, remove and configure isolated environments, configure client policies and credentials, and force upgrades. The streamed isolated environments may be isolated from other applications and the host operating system on the clients and applications within the isolated environments may run without performing an application-installation on the client.

This invention pertains generally to enterprise computer systems computer networks embedded computer systems wireless devices such as cell phones computer systems and more particularly to methods systems and procedures i.e. programming for providing application isolation for multiple applications running on a host operating system and for streaming live applications within isolated environments from a central server into isolated environments on a client and for streaming entire isolated environments from a central server onto a client.

In many environments one of the most important features is to ensure that one running application doesn t affect other running applications and that the crash of one application doesn t compromise other running applications. In many environments applications share system resources libraries and hardware which expose subtle interconnects between seemingly unrelated applications.

Several approaches have been developed addressing this fundamental problem. The first level of application isolation is provided by the operating system. Modern operating systems such as Linux UNIX Windows2000 NT XP and Vista provide some level of application isolation through the use of processes and the underlying hardware memory management unit. The use of processes generally ensure than one running application process cannot address memory owned by other processes. This first level of isolation does not address the use of shared resources such as files file systems shared memory and libraries so other approaches have been developed.

The present invention builds on the teachings in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12 813 593 12 813 618 12 421 691 12 421 692 and 12 421 694 where Havemose Havemose teaches SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR APPLICATION ISOLATION WITH LIVE MIGRATION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR HIERARCHICAL INTERCEPTION WITH ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS and SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR APPLICATION ISOLATION . Havemose discloses system and methods for creating and maintaining isolated environments wherein applications can be installed and run without interfering with any other applications on the host system. Havemose further discloses system and methods for creating isolated environments and for the use of pre created isolated environment as installation free images that can run on a client without requiring direct application installation on the client. Havemose also teaches live migration of isolated environment and the use of hierarchical interception. Havemose teaches an approach that works on commodity operating system using off the shelf applications. All of the patent applications were included in their entirety by reference above.

A related challenge is the deployment of applications across a large enterprise or network. By way of example an enterprise may need to install and keep updated the word processing and spreadsheet applications on thousands of computer systems. With security and software updates being released almost daily this is a major ongoing undertaking and one that takes dedicated and highly trained staff. With hardware changing rapidly as well it s not uncommon for a large enterprise to support hundreds of slightly different platforms with different underlying hardware such as video card network card amount of memory and peripherals. A solution would be to store all applications centrally and have the applications automatically installed upgraded and patched when launched. While this eliminates the manual process of upgrading all applications it does involve actual installation and upgrading which is fraught with possibilities for mistakes.

A variety of approaches has been created to address these particular challenges. Most require custom applications custom operating systems or actual installation and updating of all of those thousands of systems.

In U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 301 066 Smith et. al teach OS mini boot for running multiple environments . According to the disclosures each silo is mini booted from the same base operating system and isolated using name spaces. This requires a customized operating system with support for mini boot. A typical commercial environment running a commodity installation of Microsoft Windows or Linux therefore cannot utilize these teachings.

In U.S. Pat. No. 6 574 618 Eylon et al. teach Method and System for executing networked streamed application . The core teachings rely on a virtual file system installed on the client and mounted as a local file system combined with breaking up the application steaming into streamlets with delivery of the streamlets into the virtual file system. While this addresses one way to deliver applications it does not address the concerns about application isolation and requires installation of a custom file system on all clients.

In U.S. Pat. No. 7 127 713 Davis et al teach Java application framework for use in content delivery networks CDN . The core teachings describe a particular way to divide the server application into a highly distributed edge layer and a core centralized origin layer. While this addresses scalable delivery of content it does so in the context of Java and relies on the Java environment. It is not generally applicable to non Java applications.

In U.S. Pat. No. 7 370 071 Greschler et al teach Method for serving third party software applications from servers to client computers . The disclosures describe a method for hosting applications on a web server and methods for downloading and upgrading the application to a client computer. The disclosures do not address application isolation and furthermore requires upgrading the client computer application installations every time there s a software update.

Therefore in many systems streaming of applications from a central location requires one or more of customized operating systems custom file systems customized applications and proprietary streaming protocols or is limited to specific languages or run time environments such as Java. Furthermore the above cited references do not include or address application isolation. Hence there is a need for systems and methods that combine application isolation with streaming of applications from a central server for standard applications running on commodity operating systems such as Windows and Linux.

A method system apparatus and or computer program are disclosed for streaming one or more applications from a central server onto one or more clients. The one or more applications are pre configured inside one or more isolated environment and the isolated environments are streamed to the clients. The teachings of Havemose work on commodity operating systems such as Windows and Linux and work with standard off the shelf applications no customizations of operating system or applications are required and no virtual machines virtual file system or any proprietary streaming protocols are needed. The isolated environments with said one of more applications are streamed to the clients and the clients can run said one or more applications without ever performing a local installation. In one embodiment an implementation in the Linux environment is disclosed in another embodiment an implementation on Windows is disclosed.

Another aspect of the present invention is a caching subsystem enabling optimized streaming of isolated environments. The caching subsystem ensures that by way of example after an isolated environment has been updated with a software patch that only the necessary changes are streamed to clients using the particular isolated environment.

Yet other aspects of the present invention are a two way authentication subsystem and encryption of communication data. The streaming server is authenticated by clients before they accepting any streaming data and clients likewise are authenticated against pre defined credentials before the streaming servers delivers any isolated environments or updates.

A user of the client computer can run the application without needing to install or configure the application the user runs the application as pre configured and provided on the streaming server. The present teachings require no special virtual file systems proprietary streaming protocols or any other proprietary protocols.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to a computer readable medium comprising instructions for streaming one or more applications from a central server onto one or more clients. The instructions are for streaming applications within isolated environments from a central server to one or more clients for clients to run said one or more applications for a two way authentication subsystem and encryption of communication data and the ability to run said one or more applications on clients without performing an installation of said one or more applications on said clients.

Further aspects of the invention will be brought out in the following portions of the specification wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing limitations thereon.

Referring more specifically to the drawings for illustrative purposes the present invention will be disclosed in relation to through . It will be appreciated that the system and apparatus of the invention may vary as to configuration and as to details of the constituent components and that the method may vary as to the specific steps and sequence without departing from the basic concepts as disclosed herein.

The context in which this invention is disclosed is one or more applications installed inside isolated environments and hosted on an Isolated Environment Streaming Server IESS with the isolated environments being streamed to one or more clients. The Havemose reference cited above included in its entirety by reference teaches the creation and maintenance of the isolated environments. Without affecting the general case of multiple applications the following scenarios often depict and describe one or two applications as applicable. Multiple applications are handled in a similar manner. Similarly the following scenarios often depict one or two clients multiple clients are handled in a similar manner. Similarly the following scenarios often depict one isolated environment per client multiple isolated environments are handled in a similar manner. Similarly the following scenarios often depict one IESS multiple IESSes are handled in a similar manner.

Each client connects to the IESS via the Client Policy Manager CPM . The CPM validates the credentials and maintains an Account for each credentialed client. Associated with each Client Account is an update cache used to optimize access to isolated environments enabled for the particular client. Each client has one update cache per credentialed IE. If a client account has access to two IEs there are thus two update caches for that particular client.

It is readily apparent to someone skilled in the art that the architecture extends to any number of clients any number of isolated environments on any one client and to any number of pre configured isolated environments on the IESS.

System resources such as CPUs I O devices Network interfaces and storage are accessed using the operating system . Devices accessing remote resources use some form of transport network . By way of example system networking may use TCP IP over Ethernet transport Storage may use Fibre Channel or Ethernet transport and I O may use USB.

To ensure secure and private communication the IESS most be properly credentialed. By way of example if personnel in HR want to interact with the payroll system on the IESS and upload payroll information the client system used by the HR employee validates the credentials of the IESS before uploading sensitive payroll information. If the IESS credential validation fails the client system disconnects and stops interacting with the IESS.

A related issue is security ensuring that no malware of spyware gets downloaded into the clients isolated environments. By requiring a credentialed IESS there a no risks of connecting to a malware site by mistake as such connections would be refused by the isolated environment infrastructure without establishing any connection beyond the initial attempt to validate credentials.

Full IESS credentials are provided by a standard SSL certificate issued by either a certificate authority or generated in house. If the IESS is accessed over the internet a preferred implementation uses a certificate issued by a Certificate Authority. If the IESS only is accessed via a private LAN WAN or VPN an in house generated certificate would suffice but a certificates issued by a Certificate Authority equally works.

The present invention establishes the initial secure communication using Secure Sockets Layer SSL a standardized technology widely available in modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux. Open source implementations of SSL include OpenSSL www.openssl.org .

First a certificate for the IESS is generated. Generation of the IESS certificate only is needed when creating a new certificate or when a certificate has expired. Generally a certificate is valid for one or more years if generated by a certificate authority. First a private and public key pair is generated . This is accomplished using commonly available tools such as makekey provided by OpenSSL. In a preferred implementation the a certificate request is prepared certreq in OpenSSL with the public key and transmitted to the Certificate Authority together with information confirming the senders identity. The Certificate Authority generates a certificate and delivers it back to the originator and the certificate is installed on the IESS. In an alternate implementation the certificate is self generated using one of the available tools such as testreq from OpenSSL. The certificate is used to establish the credentials of the IESS by clients.

The client initiates communication with the IESS using SSL. In response to the initial contact the IESS accepts the request for the certificate and delivers the certificate to the client. The client validates the certificate . Validation can take one of two forms in a preferred implementation the certificate is compared against a local copy provided by the administrator as part of present invention in an alternate implementation the certificate is validated against known and pre approved certificate authorities. Modern operating systems such as Linux and Windows provide a mechanism to store pre approved certificates. If the validation fails the client disconnects as the IESS is rogue mis configured or has an invalid certificate. If the certificate validates the client proceeds and using SSL establishes secure and encrypted communication with the IESS.

The client is now ready to have its client credentials validated by the Client Policy Manager CPM within the IESS.

With possibly multiple isolated environments hosted on an IESS proper authentication of clients is important. By way of example if a particular isolated environment contains a payroll software application only clients with the proper credentials generally personnel in human resources should have access to the payroll application. The Client Policy Manager CPM running on the IESS governs which clients have access to which isolated environment. The specific client privileges are set by the system administrator and are implemented by the CPM.

The connection between client and IESS as describe above is established using SSL and is therefore secure and encrypted. The client only needs the client account as its credentials. All IEs available to a particular client are managed by the CPM and the key pair needed for encryption is managed by SSL.

When a client wishes to use a particular application within an isolated environment the client makes a request to the Client Policy Manager CPM for access to the requested IE. The CPM validates the client credentials at two levels first the client is validated as having access to the IESS services followed by validation of the client s credentials for the requested IE.

If the client is credentialed to run the particular IE the IE needs to be either installed or potentially updated. If the IE is not installed on the client it is copied to the client environment and the IESS update caches are updated to reflect the current state of the client copy. If the IE already is installed on the client the update caches on IESS are queried and updates propagated as necessary. The caching and installation are described in more detail below.

When a client starts the present invention he is presented with a list of available IEs based on his credentials. illustrates by way of example embodiment a client obtaining the list of credentialed applications and launching a chosen application. First the client is credentialed as described above. The client requests a list of credentialed IEs and the CPM responds with a list of IEs available and credentialed for the particular client. The list is presented to the client . In a preferred embodiment the client is presented with a graphical user interface allowing the client to choose from a list of credentialed applications and starting the application directly by clicking either on the application name or OK . The launch can be cancelled by selecting Cancel . The client can also force a refresh of available IEs thereby updating the IE list . In a preferred embodiment the most recently chosen application is automatically highlighted. By way of example illustrates the scenario with two credentialed applications Payroll and Benefits and one application no longer credentialed Investor Relations . By selecting Off line the user indicates no synchronization against the IESS and that the local already installed IE should be run.

The Client Policy Manager CPM within the IESS is the main contact point between clients and the IESS. The functionality of the CPM fall in several broad categories 1 delivery of certificates to clients and establishment of SSL 2 general client account access 3 administration and 4 management and implementation of the caching subsystem. illustrates by way of example embodiment the architectural blocks of the CPM .

As disclosed previously the IESS is credentialed by clients using a SSL certificate. The certificate serves dual roles as a mechanism for the clients to validate the identity of the IESS and by providing keys for secure encrypted communication over SSL. Referring to for illustrative purposes the IESS certificate interface is responsible for responding to certificate requests and to deliver them. The SSL interface is responsible for the IESS end of SSL. In modern operating systems SSL is in general pre defined to use certain ports such as and for SSL certificates and https respectively. In a preferred implementation the present invention uses different ports that the default ports to avoid conflicts with web browsing and to minimize attacks. In an alternate implementation the standard ports are used.

As previously disclosed the CPM provides a number of client services. Referring to for illustrative purposes The validation of clients as disclosed in section the enumeration of available IEs given the clients credentials section and the general client account and credentials subsystem containing an account database with account info for each valid client account

Associated with each client account is a record in the account database containing specific information about the account and subsystems for cache management and billing logging . Each client account record in the database contains at least the following fields 

The client login is the user id used to validate the client account while the account holder name is the actual name of the person to which the account is assigned. The status of account indicates if the account is valid and credentialed. Finally the database maintains a list of isolated environments to which the user is credentialed. This list is presented to the user when requesting Client IE enumeration as disclosed in section .

Associated with the client account are also the caching subsystem and the billing and logging subsystem .

When a client requests access to a credentialed isolated environment the IE is streamed in its entirety if not already present on the client system or the client IE is selectively updated with changes as appropriate. In the following the details on these steps are disclosed.

By way of example a typical Microsoft Office 2003 installation consists of approximately 1800 files with a combined size of about 315 MB. Some of the largest files are Word at 12 MB Excel at 10 MB and PowerPoint at 6 MB. On a typical 1 Gbit sec corporate network a typical good transmission rate is about 100 MB sec but can be significantly less. A typical ADSL connection runs at 1.5 Mbit sec or 150 kB sec and can be less.

The one time installation of the entire environment with Office 2003 therefore typically takes about 3.1 sec or longer over corporate network. Over ADSL the Office IE takes 35 min or longer. While the 3.5 seconds on the office network is acceptable the 35 minutes for ADSL access is not practical. The present invention includes an update caching subsystem ensuring that only changed files are streamed to the client and furthermore that the streaming is compressed when appropriate.

To reduce the need to stream files already present on the client computer an update cache is employed for each IE. The update cache contains pre computed information assisting in quickly indentifying which files have changed since last time the IE was accessed thereby reducing unnecessary streaming of IE files.

The update cache for a particular IE is comprised of a list of records called CacheLine where each record corresponds to one file within the isolated environment. The data structure for CacheLine in pseudo code 

The field m FileName is the name of the file and m Directory the directory location of the file. The combination of m FileName and m Directory uniquely identifies the file. The field m LastChangeTime is the time at which the particular file was most recently changed updated or created and m FileSize is the size of the file.

To make the update cache efficient the present invention pre computes a m messageDigest representing the file. The message digest is a 128 bit or longer integer calculated in a manner to ensure that two different files have different message digests. Message Digests are well known within the art. Commonly deployed digests are MD5 Message Digest algorithm 5 of size 128 bit MD6 Message Digest algorithm 6 with sizes up to 512 bits and SHA n Secure Hash Algorithm n with sizes up to 1024 bits . The message digest is used as part of the validation to see if a particular file should be streamed to the client. A practical issue is hash collision where two different files produce the same hash value. SHA 2 has no known hash collisions and is the default in a preferred embodiment. To further reduce the risk of a hash collision possibly affecting the update caches the size of the file m FileSize and the time stamp of the most recent file change m LastChangeTime are also used in the comparing against the update cache.

All supported Message Digests Algorithms are predefined as integers and the one used encoded in the field m MessageDigestAlgorithm .

Another field m CompressionOn determines if compression is used for the particular file corresponding to the CacheLine. Depending on file size network bandwidth and available CPU cycles files may selectively be compressed prior to being streamed to the client. All supported compression algorithms are pre defined as integers and the one used encoded in the field m compressionAlgorithm . Compression algorithms are provided as part of modern operating systems such as Windows and Linux. In a preferred embodiment the operating systems default compression algorithm is used. In an alternate embodiment a customized compression algorithm is used. A wide selection of open source and commercial no loss compression algorithms exists including but not limited to LZ LZR LZX PKZIP GZIP and ZIP. In a preferred embodiment files are automatically compressed if the network operates at less than 1.5 mbit sec and the file size is greater than 1 MB. In an alternate embodiment every file is compressed. In another alternate embodiment no files are compressed.

The Havemose reference cited above and included in its entirety teach creation and updating of isolated environments. The IE s associated update cache is generated after install update as follows in pseudo code 

When creating a new Isolated Environment and installing applications within the IE all CacheLines in the update cache are new. The above listed set of instructions thus creates the update cache with all new elements.

By way of example after applying a software patch the update cache needs to be updated. A software patch generally modifies adds and removes files and the update cache is updated to reflect the changes. Referring to the pseudo code above CacheLines corresponding to new files are added CacheLines corresponding to modified files are re computed and updated and CacheLines corresponding to now deleted files are removed. Files unaffected by the software patch are left unchanged in the update cache. Similarly the update caches are updated after a patch to the operating system.

Optimized streaming where the fewest possible files are streamed from the IESS to a client requesting the use or update of a particular isolated environment is achieved by using of the update caches on both the client and the IESS

To determine which files within the IE on the IESS have been modified since the client last connected the Cache Mgr compares the client s u cache with the corresponding update cache on the IESS. The entire process is as follows 

Initially the client and the IE are credentialed against the CPM as previously disclosed . The client requests an update of the IE and transmits the client s u cache to the CPMs cache mgr . The CacheMgr s traverses the update cache one CacheLine at a time and comparing against the u cache received from the client . First test is to see if the current CacheLine is present in the client s u cache. If the CacheLine is not in the u cache it signifies a new file in the IE and the file corresponding to the CacheLine is prepared to be transmitted to the client . If the CacheLine exists in the u cache a second test is performed. The second test is to see if the CacheLine entry has been updated when compared to the corresponding u cache CacheLine. If the IESS CacheLine indicates a change has been made the file corresponding to the CacheLine is prepared to be transmitted to the client. If the CacheLines are identical in the update cache and u cache no further steps on this CacheLine are necessary.

The second test to see if two CacheLine Entries are identical is performed as follows The client u cache and the update cache CacheLines are considered identical if all of the following are identical m FileName m Directory m LastChangeTime m FileSize and m MessageDigest. If one or more of said fields are different the entry is deemed not too match.

The final step after identifying a file for transmittal to the client is to test if the file should be compressed per the field in the CacheLine. If the file is to be compressed it s compressed and transmitted . If compression is not activated the file is transmitted .

Upon completing the comparison of the client s u cache with the update cache the update cache is sent to the client

On the client all new files are received and copied into the environment . Finally the u cache is replaced with the update cache corresponding to the just completed update . The final step is to synchronize the client s new u cache against the client s IE and remove files no longer included in the u cache . If the client immediately reconnected the update process would detect no new files and the update process would be instantaneous.

In continuation of the example above a typical Microsoft Office security patch modifies few of the 1800 files in full installation of Office. By way of example if files are modified only those 50 files need to be streamed to the client corresponding to less than 3 of the total installation. This reduces the ADLS update from 35 minutes to 1 minute which is a practical delay to install a patch over a slower network.

The present invention supports two modes of operation an off line mode of operation where the client runs an already installed isolated environment without connecting to the IESS and an on line mode where the client is fully validated and updates automatically are streamed.

By way of example a user connects with the present invention while at the office retrieves and updates all credentialed IEs and works with the applications within the IE as if they were locally installed. Later the user is travelling and loads the present invention again. This time the user selects the off line mode of operation. In stead of getting credentialed by the IESS the user simply runs the applications within the already installed IEs. No updates are forced and no changes are streamed. The off line mode allows the user to work without needing network access.

If the network is available on line mode is enabled and the user can choose to operate in on line or off line mode . If the user chooses off line the user is presented with the list of already credentialed IEs available to run . The user chooses an IE and the IE is run. If the user chooses to proceed in on line mode the steps outlined in section and are followed . Upon finishing the IEI exits the IE

The present invention provides administration for both clients and the IESS. Administration on the client is a matter of installing the IEI and the user account name all other administrative options are contained and controlled on the IESS.

In a preferred embodiment the administration is performed using a graphical user interface. In an alternate embodiment as software application programming interface API is used.
