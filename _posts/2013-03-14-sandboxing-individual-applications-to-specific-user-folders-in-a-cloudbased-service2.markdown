Signals received or detected indicating user activity at client devices through one or more of the above input mechanism or others can be used by various users or collaborators e.g. collaborators for accessing through network a web based collaboration environment or online collaboration platform e.g. hosted by the host server . The collaboration environment or platform can have one or more collective settings for an enterprise or an organization that the users belong and can provide an user interface for the users to access such platform under the settings .

The collaboration platform or environment hosts workspaces with work items that one or more users can access e.g. view edit update revise comment download preview tag or otherwise manipulate etc. . A work item can generally include any type of digital or electronic content that can be viewed or accessed via an electronic device e.g. device . The digital content can include .pdf files .doc slides e.g. Powerpoint slides images audio files multimedia content web pages blogs etc. A workspace can generally refer to any grouping of a set of digital content in the collaboration platform. The grouping can be created identified or specified by a user or through other means. This user may be a creator user or administrative user for example.

In general a workspace can be associated with a set of users or collaborators e.g. collaborators which have access to the content included therein. The levels of access e.g. based on permissions or rules of each user or collaborator to access the content in a given workspace may be the same or may vary among the users. Each user may have their own set of access rights to every piece of content in the workspace or each user may be different access rights to different pieces of content. Access rights may be specified by a user associated with a work space and or a user who created uploaded a particular piece of content to the workspace or any other designated user or collaborator.

In general the collaboration platform allows multiple users or collaborators to access or collaborate efforts on work items such each user can see remotely edits revisions comments or annotations being made to specific work items through their own user devices. For example a user can upload a document to a work space for other users to access e.g. for viewing editing commenting signing off or otherwise manipulating . The user can login to the online platform and upload the document or any other type of work item to an existing work space or to a new work space. The document can be shared with existing users or collaborators in a work space.

In general network over which the client devices and the host server communicate may be a cellular network a telephonic network an open network such as the Internet or a private network such as an intranet and or the extranet or any combination or variation thereof. For example the Internet can provide file transfer remote log in email news RSS cloud based services instant messaging visual voicemail push mail VoIP and other services through any known or convenient protocol such as but is not limited to the TCP IP protocol Open System Interconnections OSI FTP UPnP iSCSI NSF ISDN PDH RS 232 SDH SONET etc.

The network can be any collection of distinct networks operating wholly or partially in conjunction to provide connectivity to the client devices and the host server and may appear as one or more networks to the serviced systems and devices. In one embodiment communications to and from the client devices can be achieved by an open network such as the Internet or a private network such as an intranet and or the extranet. In one embodiment communications can be achieved by a secure communications protocol such as secure sockets layer SSL or transport layer security TLS .

In addition communications can be achieved via one or more networks such as but are not limited to one or more of WiMax a Local Area Network LAN Wireless Local Area Network WLAN a Personal area network PAN a Campus area network CAN a Metropolitan area network MAN a Wide area network WAN a Wireless wide area network WWAN enabled with technologies such as by way of example Global System for Mobile Communications GSM Personal Communications Service PCS Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service D Amps Bluetooth Wi Fi Fixed Wireless Data 2G 2.5G 3G 4G IMT Advanced pre 4G 3G LTE 3GPP LTE LTE Advanced mobile WiMax WiMax 2 WirelessMAN Advanced networks enhanced data rates for GSM evolution EDGE General packet radio service GPRS enhanced GPRS iBurst UMTS HSPDA HSUPA HSPA UMTS TDD 1xRTT EV DO messaging protocols such as TCP IP SMS MMS extensible messaging and presence protocol XMPP real time messaging protocol RTMP instant messaging and presence protocol IMPP instant messaging USSD IRC or any other wireless data networks or messaging protocols.

Third party applications which may be located from one or more third party service application providers such as illustrated in or they may be provided by third party software application vendors and may be accessed over the network or accessed from via installed executed and run on the user devices . In either configuration the third party applications may communicate with the host server for accessing cloud based collaboration platform storage and or services in performing their functions.

The embodiments disclosed herein recognize that with the growing prevalence of the communication networks e.g. the Internet and smart portable devices e.g. smart phones there are many third party applications that need access to a cloud based collaboration service platform and or cloud based file and content storage services in order to best facilitate an intuitive and straightforward user experience. For example a user using a smart phone or a tablet computer may wish to run a third party software application e.g. Google QuickOffice to create or open a document save the document back to a cloud based collaboration and or storage e.g. cloud based collaboration and or storage services provided by Box Inc. repository and share it with a selected group of collaborators or in an enterprise including colleagues. One colleague as a reviewer may use another third party software application e.g. Nuance Paperport to annotate it and another colleague may use yet another third party software application e.g. Adobe Echosign to sign the document all accessing the same document on the cloud based collaboration interaction and or storage services. For another example a user of a third party service application e.g. LinkedIn or Facebook may want to store his or her resume and or other files on a user profile page provided by the third party service application which in turn would desirably store these files on a cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration and or storage services of the user.

However whether it is for collaboration or for personal use or for both existing techniques lack a simplistic way for the third party applications and the users to enjoy a streamlined cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration and or storage services experience without interrupting the user and or risking a breach of security and or privacy. As previously mentioned typically whenever a third party application needs to access a cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration and or storage services for its one or more users a user account authentication process is triggered. If the user does not have an account with the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration and or storage services provider then typically the user is prompted to create an account with the provider and if the user has an account already then typically the user needs to log onto e.g. via the third party application or directly using host server the service and or to provide the access code. By surrendering the access code information to and or sharing access privileges with the third party application the user becomes susceptible to exploitation from malicious third party applications.

Accordingly embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods that provide application specific user folders or areas for sandboxing individual applications in a cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services so that such service may be enjoyed without interrupting the user and or risking the user s security and or privacy.

In accordance with some embodiments when a user employs the third party application to engage a use that requires access to a cloud based storage the user supplies the third party application with a user identifier e.g. an email address of the user who may or may not be an account holder of the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services . In one implementation the third party application generates its own unique identifier for a particular user.

With the user identifier the third party application sends to the host server a request for an area that is specific for the third party application and for the user. In one embodiment the request includes the user identifier. After the host server receives the request from the third party application the host server automatically allocates the area and grants access of the area to the third party application . In one or more embodiments the access is limited to only the area. Some embodiments provide that a special token may be used between the host server and the third party application to allow the third party application to access the area and the area only. In this way with just an email address for example the third party application can gain access to an application specific area or a sandbox folder just for the application in an area of the user in the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services without triggering the aforementioned authentication process and the user does not need to log onto the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services or surrender his or her access code in order to give the application access to the sandbox folder.

More implementation details regarding the host server and the third party application are discussed below.

The web based platform for collaborating on projects or jointly working on documents can be used by individual users and shared among collaborators. In addition the collaboration platform can be deployed in an organized setting including but not limited to a company e.g. an enterprise setting a department in a company an academic institution a department in an academic institution a class or course setting or any other types of organizations or organized setting.

When deployed in an organizational setting multiple workspaces e.g. workspace A B C can be created to support different projects or a variety of work flows. Each workspace can have its own associate work items. For example work space A may be associated with work items work space B can be associated with work items and work space N can be associated with work items . The work items and may be unique to each work space but need not be. For example a particular word document can be associated with only one work space e.g. work space A or it may be associated with multiple work spaces e.g. Work space A and work space B etc. .

In general each work space has a set of users or collaborators associated with it. For example work space A is associated with multiple users or collaborators . In some instances work spaces deployed in an enterprise may be department specific. For example work space B may be associated with department and some users shown as example user A and workspace N can be associated with departments and and users shown as example user B .

Each user associated with a work space can generally access the work items associated with the work space. The level of access will depend on permissions associated with the specific work space and or with a specific work item. Permissions can be set for the work space or set individually on a per work item basis. For example the creator of a work space e.g. one of user A who creates work space B can set one permission setting applicable to all work items for other associated users and or users associated with the affiliate department for example. Creator user A may also set different permission settings for each work item which may be the same for different users or varying for different users.

In each work space A B . . . N when an action is performed on a work item by a given user or any other activity is detected in the work space other users in the same work space may be notified e.g. in real time or in near real time or not in real time . Activities which trigger real time notifications can include by way of example but not limitation adding deleting or modifying collaborators in the work space uploading downloading adding deleting a work item in the work space creating a discussion topic in the work space.

In some embodiments items or content downloaded or edited can cause notifications to be generated. Such notifications can be sent to relevant users to notify them of actions surrounding a download an edit a change a modification a new file a conflicting version an upload of an edited or modified file.

In one embodiment in a user interface to the web based collaboration platform where notifications are presented users can via the same interface create action items e.g. tasks and delegate the action items to other users including collaborators pertaining to a work item for example. The collaborators may be in the same workspace A or the user may include a newly invited collaborator. Similarly in the same user interface where discussion topics can be created in a work space e.g. work space A B or N etc. actionable events on work items can be created and or delegated assigned to other users such as collaborators of a given work space or other users. Through the same user interface task status and updates from multiple users or collaborators can be indicated and reflected. In some instances the users can perform the tasks e.g. review or approve or reject etc. via the same user interface.

Each of users and can individually use multiple different devices to access and or manipulate work items in the work space with which they are associated with. For example users can be collaborators on a project to which work items are relevant. Since the work items are hosted by the collaboration environment e.g. a cloud based environment each user can access the work items anytime and from any physical location using any device e.g. including devices they own or any shared public loaner device .

Work items to be edited or viewed can be accessed from the workspace . Users can also be notified of access edit modification and or upload related actions performed on work items by other users or any other types of activities detected in the work space . For example if user modifies a document one or both of the other collaborators and can be notified of the modification in real time or near real time or not in real time. The notifications can be sent through any of all of the devices associated with a given user in various formats including one or more of email SMS or via a pop up window in a user interface in which the user uses to access the collaboration platform. In the event of multiple notifications each notification can be depicted preferentially e.g. ordering in the user interface based on user preferences and or relevance to the user e.g. implicit or explicit .

For example a notification of a download access read write edit or uploaded related activities can be presented in a feed stream among other notifications through a user interface on the user device according to relevancy to the user determined based on current or recent activity of the user in the web based collaboration environment.

In one embodiment the notification feed stream further enables users to create or generate actionable events e.g. as task which are or can be performed by other users or collaborators e.g. including admin users or other users not in the same work space either in the same work space or in some other work space. The actionable events such as tasks can also be assigned or delegated to other users via the same user interface.

For example a given notification regarding a work item can be associated with user interface features allowing a user to assign a task related to the work item e.g. to another user admin user creator user or another user . In one embodiment a commenting user interface or a comment action associated with a notification can be used in conjunction with user interface features to enable task assignment delegation and or management of the relevant work item or work items in the relevant work spaces in the same user interface.

The user devices may run on different operating systems and may have different human machine interfaces. A regular folder may be where the user typically store his or her personal files including for example documents presentation slides or sound recordings. It is noted that folder are merely a representative area that stored the user s personal files in the user space as the personal files may be stored within one or more hierarchies of folders or none of the folders e.g. under a root directory . An application specific area or sandbox folders can store those files that are needed by created by or otherwise used by the third party application . Similar to the third party application in both configurations A and B the third party application may communicate with a host server e.g. server not shown in for simplicity of the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services for accessing cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services e.g. user space and or services in performing its functions. In one or more embodiments the area that is created is generally apparent in the user space for one example the name of the area may be named after the application .

In an alternative embodiment such as shown in diagram of a mobile device can have a mobile client installed on one or more memory components not shown for simplicity of the device . The mobile client can access the cloud based environment such as one hosted by server which in turn provides access to the third party application . In this type of embodiment the mobile client can create the application specific area which is specific for the third party application on the mobile device .

According to some embodiments the third party application may gain access to the application specific area for the application in the user space with a user identifier of the user without triggering the conventional authentication process. The identifier may be an email address of the user or a serial number issued to the user or may be generated by the third party application using one or more other methods or processes. Notably the user need not log onto the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services nor provide his or her access code in order to give the application access to the application specific area .

More specifically to access the application specific area on the host server first the third party application sends to the host server a request for the area or the sandbox folder that is specific for the third party application and for the user . The request may include the user identifier. After the host server receives the request from the third party application the host server allocates the area and grants access of the area to the third party application . In one or more embodiments the third party application s access is limited to only the area . In other words the application only gains access to the area but it cannot access anything else in the user space except the area . All other files and folders e.g. folder that are stored inside the user space are invisible to the application .

Depending on the implementation the server may verify a consent of the user before the server allocates and grants the area . In such cases the third party application may acquire the consent before the application sends the request to the server . In some examples the consent is a one time only user approval which only requires the user to respond affirmatively or negatively.

As additional or alternative embodiments the area s content is encrypted by the server and the third party application can cause the server to decrypt the content so that the application may access the area s content by employing an application programming interface API that is provided by the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services .

Furthermore in some embodiments the server grants access by providing to the third party application a unique token which may be received and used by the application to access the area or the application specific folder . The token can only be used to access the specific folder and not anywhere else in the user space . In order to access the area the third party application needs to present to the server the token. Upon verifying or being presented with the token the server then decrypts the content of the area for the application to access. Notably in some instances the server may preclude the user from editing the content of the area . For example such preclusion or restriction may be imposed by the third party application and or as a policy set by the cloud service provider of space so that user may have limited access to e.g. viewing the content but otherwise have no permission for editing modifying removing or other types of access to individual files that constitute the area s content.

In accordance with some embodiments disclosed herein the user of the third party application may still make use of the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services even if the user does not have an account already established with the cloud based service provider.

More specifically before the server allocates the area the server may first determine if the user space associated with the user already exists on the server . The determination may be performed by checking whether one work space associated with the user identifier e.g. an email address already exists and or by other supplemental identifying methods e.g. by user s full name birthplace computer MAC address etc. and or suitable policies. If the user space associated with the user already exists on the server then the server allocates and grants access of area to the application upon receiving the request without requiring authentication to the work space based on the techniques discussed above. Additionally or alternatively the server prompts the user to give a permission to establish the area in the user space for the third party application .

An example of this is shown in where a screenshot of a user interface e.g. interface of the user space displays a plurality of pending actions one of them being a prompting dialog asking the user for a permission to establish the area for the third party application . The user may respond affirmatively by clicking on an accept button or may respond negatively by clicking on a reject button . If the user accepts the server automatically allocates and grants access of the area to the application so that the application s functions can be enabled. If the user rejects the server automatically denies the application s request and the application s functions will not be enabled for the user to use. In some instances the application can be configured to adopt an ask each time model if the user rejects the application specific area s creation or if the user instructs the application to do so e.g. by using a preference setting .

Further the user may also give the option to revoke the given permission by deleting the area in the user space . depicts such an example. As shown in a screenshot of a user space e.g. space in a cloud based environment displays an established third party application specific folder as well as instructions on how to revoke the third party application s access. The user may use one of the buttons and or checkboxes in an action area to perform such removal of the sandbox folder so as to cause the server to revoke the granted access.

Continuing with the examples of according to some implementations if the server determines that the user space does not exist then the server e.g. the server which hosts the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services allots an amount of space on the server as the user space and establishes the area in the user space . In this way the user of the third party application can still make use of the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services provided by the server even if the user has not actually established an account with the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services for himself or herself yet. As a result not only does the embodiments disclosed herein enable a smooth user experience with streamlined third party application integration but they also improve the security for the user s stored data because the application can access to the sandbox area and generally the area only.

Further in some additional or alternative embodiments besides the third party application accessing to the application specific area as discussed above the third party application may also acquire through an authentication process e.g. via passwords access to folder and or other files in the user space . In some of these embodiments the server may operate in a first or a second mode or both. When the server operates in the first mode the server allocates and grants the application specific area without requiring the password to the user space and when the server operates in the second mode the server requires to receive the password from the user either directly via user devices or indirectly via the third party application and the server allocates and grants access to user space and or folder in addition to the application specific area when the password is received. In some embodiments for example where the user space can include a collaborative space while the folder is a personal folder access to the two may each require a password and in some instances a different password.

First with reference to the host server e.g. server of the cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services receives from a third party application e.g. the social networking service application a request for an application specific folder e.g. area for the user e.g. user . The request includes a user identifier e.g. a user s email that identifies the user of the cloud based environment. In some embodiments the server then verifies a consent of the user .

Next the server determines whether a work space e.g. user space associated with the user s email already exists. If user space already exists then the server allocates the area specific for the third party application and for the user in the work space . Optionally the server may prompt the user to give a permission e.g. via accept button to establish the area .

Thereafter the server grants access of the area to the third party application . In some embodiments the server delivers to the third party application a token. The server then encrypts content of the area . It is noted that this encryption step does not need to be performed after . Then upon the application presenting the token the server decrypts the content of the area for the application to access.

If user space does not exist then the server allots an amount of space on the server as the user space . Then the server establishes the area in the space and grants access of the area to the application using the aforementioned techniques.

Accordingly the embodiments provided herein enable a third party application to use a user identifier e.g. an email address or other identifiers of its user to access a limited area of a cloud based environment platform services e.g. collaboration file sharing and or storage services without necessarily triggering user account authentication thereby avoiding the process of requiring access codes from the user which may adversely impact user experience as well as compromise security and or user s privacy.

In alternative embodiments the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected e.g. networked to other machines. In a networked deployment the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in a client server network environment or as a peer machine in a peer to peer or distributed network environment.

The machine may be a server computer a client computer a personal computer PC a user device a tablet a phablet a laptop computer a set top box STB a personal digital assistant PDA a thin client device a cellular telephone an iPhone an iPad a Blackberry a processor a telephone a web appliance a network router switch or bridge a console a hand held console a hand held gaming device a music player any portable mobile hand held device or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine.

While the machine readable medium or machine readable storage medium is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium and machine readable storage medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium and machine readable storage medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the presently disclosed technique and innovation.
