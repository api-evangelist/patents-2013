This application is a continuation in part of and claims priority to co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 089 551 entitled SYSTEM LINEARIZATION ASSEMBLY AND METHOD FOR USE IN MODIFYING DISTORTION COMPONENTS filed Nov. 25 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802 09 C 0001 awarded by the Department of the Air Force. The government has certain rights in this invention.

The embodiments described herein relate generally to systems that effect a transfer function on an input signal to produce an output signal that ideally has a predetermined relationship to the input signal such as amplifier systems and more particularly to a system linearization assembly that may be used with such signal handling systems.

Signal processing systems such as amplifier systems are configured to modify or change at least one parameter of a signal. For example an amplifier system may be configured to receive an input signal and to increase the amplitude of the signal preferably without inducing other changes to the signal in the process. The amplified signal or the output signal can then be transmitted to a transmission line or to an antenna for example.

However at least some amplifier circuits and similar systems exhibit at least some form of non linear behavior which may result in a distortion of the amplified or output signal. Such a distortion may decrease the overall performance of the amplifier system. For example a harmonic distortion in an electronic amplifier introduces abnormalities in the output signal at the fundamental input frequency w and at multiples of the input frequency 2w 3w etc. that constitute the inherent distortion. Some harmonic distortion can be filtered out by using bandpass filters. Intermodulation distortions IMD however include the difference of the frequencies in the output and can be difficult to filter out of the amplified or output signal. More specifically in the case of two closely spaced input signals wand w the resulting intermodulation IMD component frequency for a 3order intermodulation IM3 and other odd terms is immediately adjacent to the signals. When the resulting IMD component frequency is immediately adjacent to the signals in the frequency spectrum it can be difficult to filter out. The intensity of an norder intermodulation distortion component is proportional to the intensity of the norder harmonic distortion component provided the impedance of the output circuit is the same at both frequencies.

At least some methods have been proposed for linearization of amplified or output signals. For example one method is known as the power backoff method. The idea is to reduce the input signal amplitude so as to avoid driving the amplifier output into distortion. Such techniques control distortion and noise at the expense of amplification efficiency. Other known methods include pre distortion and post distortion methods to cancel the effect of the amplifier s non linearity.

These conventional methods seek to minimize the adverse effects of the non linearity but fail to correct the nonlinearity of the amplifier itself. Instead such methods merely cover or patch the non linearity such that the adverse effects of the non linearity can be less apparent.

The nonlinearities in transistor amplifiers are strongly dependent on the quiescent voltage and current bias settings at which the amplifier operates. For instance by changing the bias voltages supplied to a transistor amplifier the 3order nonlinear distortion can be reduced or increased. This allows for nonlinear distortion to be minimized without significantly compromising the gain in the system.

In one embodiment a system linearization assembly is provided. The system linearization assembly generally includes a delay device that is configured to receive an input signal from a signal source and to delay the input signal by a predetermined delay function. An attenuation device is coupled to the delay device. The attenuation device is configured to receive a modified output signal from a signal modifying device wherein the modified output signal is based on the input signal and includes a time varying parameter representing a plurality of frequency components including at least one component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. The attenuation device is also configured to attenuate the modified output signal by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of the signal modifying device. The delay device is configured to delay the signal by a delay function equal to the delay experienced by the signal as it passes through the signal modifying device such that the phase of the delayed signal and the attenuated signal are equal. A computing device is coupled to the delay device and to the attenuation device. The computing device is configured to compare the attenuated modified output signal with the delayed input signal and to obtain from the comparison a resultant signal that includes the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. A detection device is coupled to the computing device wherein the detection device is configured to detect at least one parameter of the resultant signal. The system linearization assembly also includes a controller that is coupled to the detection device wherein the controller is configured to facilitate a modification of the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion based on the detected parameter.

In another embodiment a signal processing system is provided. The signal processing system generally includes a signal modifying device and a system linearization assembly coupled to the signal modifying device. The signal modifying device is configured to receive an input signal from a signal source and to modify the input signal to generate a modified output signal wherein the modified output signal includes a time varying parameter representing a plurality of frequency components including at least one component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. The system linearization assembly includes a delay device that is configured to receive the input signal and to delay the input signal by a predetermined delay function. An attenuation device is coupled to the delay device wherein the attenuation device is configured to receive the modified output signal from the signal modifying device and to attenuate the modified output signal by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of the signal modifying device. The delay device is configured to delay the signal by a delay function equal to the delay experienced by the signal as it passes through the signal modifying device such that the phase of the delayed signal and the attenuated signal are equal. A computing device is coupled to the delay device and to the attenuation device. The computing device is configured to compare the attenuated modified output signal with the delayed input signal and to obtain from the comparison a resultant signal that includes the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. A detection device is coupled to the computing device wherein the detection device is configured to detect at least one parameter of the resultant signal. A controller is coupled to the detection device wherein the controller is configured to facilitate a modification of the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion based on the detected parameter.

In yet another embodiment a method for modifying distortion components is provided. An input signal is received via a delay device. The input signal is delayed by a predetermined delay function via the delay device. A modified output signal is transmitted from a signal modifying device to an attenuation device that is coupled to the delay device. The modified output signal is based on the input signal and includes a time varying parameter representing a plurality of frequency components including at least one component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. The modified output signal is attenuated by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of the signal modifying device via the attenuation device. The delay device is configured to delay the signal by a delay function equal to the delay experienced by the signal as it passes through the signal modifying device such that the phase of the delayed signal and the attenuated signal are equal. The attenuated modified output signal is compared with the delayed input signal to derive from the comparison a resultant signal that includes the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion via a computing device that is coupled to the delay device and to the attenuation device. At least one parameter of the resultant signal is detected via a detection device that is coupled to the computing device. A modification of the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion is facilitated via a controller that is coupled to the detection device wherein the modification is based on the detected parameter.

The embodiments described herein include a system linearization assembly that can be used with signal processing systems such as an amplifier system for substantially reducing or minimizing non linear intermodulation distortion components within the signals produced by the system. The system linearization assembly is configured to receive an input signal from a signal source and to delay the input signal by a predetermined delay function. The system linearization assembly is also configured to receive a modified output signal from a signal modifying device wherein the modified output signal is based on the input signal and includes a time varying parameter representing a plurality of frequency components including at least one component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. The modified output signal can be attenuated by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of the signal modifying device and the attenuated modified output signal can be compared with the delayed input signal to obtain a resultant signal that includes the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. The delay device is configured to delay the signal by a delay function equal to the delay experienced by the signal as it passes through the signal modifying device such that the phase of the delayed signal and the attenuated signal are equal. At least one parameter of the resultant signal can be detected and the detected parameter can be used to facilitate a modification of the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. Such a modification enables a reduction or minimization of the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion from the signal processing system by modifying the signal processing system itself rather than merely covering or patching the non linear intermodulation distortion component to hide its effects.

System includes an input device or an input bias tee that is configured to receive a signal from a signal source such as an antenna not shown . In some embodiments the signal can be a radio frequency RF signal that is being received via the antenna at a frequency ranging from about 10 Kilohertz to about 300 000 Megahertz. In the exemplary embodiment input bias tee is configured to combine the RF signal with an electrical bias signal such as a direct current DC voltage. Input bias tee can also be configured to combine alternating current AC signals with DC signals and or to separate the AC components from the DC components and or to combine and or to separate higher and lower frequency components.

A signal modification device such as an amplifier is coupled to input bias tee . Amplifier is configured to alter the input signal according to a transfer function such as to apply a gain factor to multiply the voltage or current or numerically digitized amplitude of a signal received from input bias tee to generate a modified output signal such as an amplified signal. It should be noted that as used herein the term couple is not limited to a direct mechanical and or an electrical connection between components but may also include an indirect mechanical and or electrical connection between two or more components or a coupling that is operative through intermediate elements or spaces. Amplifier includes a transistor such as a field effect transistor FET or a bipolar junction transistor BJT wherein transistor is configured to be biased at an optimum voltage for amplification of the signal received from input bias tee . The modified output signal or the amplified signal may include a time varying parameter such as a plurality of waves representing a plurality of frequency components including at least one component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion such as odd order intermodulation distortion that can be introduced into the signal during the amplification.

In the exemplary embodiment an output device or an output bias tee is coupled to amplifier . Output bias tee is configured to transmit the modified output signal or the amplified signal from amplifier to a system linearization assembly that is coupled to output bias tee . As explained in more detail below with respect to system linearization assembly is configured to facilitate modifying or minimizing the non linear intermodulation distortion component such as an odd order intermodulation distortion based on a comparison between the input signal and the amplified signal.

System also includes a plurality of power supplies. For example system includes a first power supply that is coupled to system linearization assembly and to input bias tee and system also includes a second power supply that is coupled to system linearization assembly and to output bias tee . In the exemplary embodiment first power supply is configured to supply DC voltages to input bias tee and second power supply is configured to supply DC voltages to output bias tee . As explained in more detail below with respect to system linearization assembly is configured to control first power supply and second power supply such that the voltages being supplied to input bias tee and output bias tee respectively can be adjusted as a means to amplify or attenuate or merely to follow the signal level as passing through the input and output bias tees . This bias control can be configured as a voltage based control as mentioned or in other embodiments that control can be based on current bias variable resistance numeric scaling etc.

During operation of system at least one signal such as an RF signal i.e. input signal is generated by a signal source e.g. received on an antenna not shown . At least a portion of the input signal is transmitted from the antenna to input bias tee and a portion of the input signal is transmitted to signal linearization assembly . Power supply transmits a control voltage such as a DC voltage to input bias tee . As such input bias tee is enabled to combine the recently received input signal with the voltage. When the input signal is combined with the voltage a quiescent operating gate voltage V is set for the amplifier. Amplifier then modifies the input signal by amplifying the power of the signal and the amplified signal is transmitted to output bias tee such that the amplified signal can also be transmitted to system linearization assembly .

The amplified signal includes a time varying parameter representing a plurality of frequency components including at least one component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion such as odd order intermodulation distortion. Amplifier exhibits some level of non linear behavior which distorts the output signal. Odd ordered intermodulation nonlinearity IM3 IM5 etc. is of particular concern because noise and other interference can become mixed with the signal within the amplifier passband. However there are naturally occurring nulls in the output powers of the nodd ordered intermodulation IM3 IM5 etc. that occur when the weighted mean of the nderivative of the amplifier voltage transfer curve is zero. Moreover the output powers and position of naturally occurring nulls of these intermodulation components are dependent on a drain source voltage quiescent voltage bias V and a gate source voltage quiescent voltage bias V . As such the 3order intermodulation IM3 can be substantially reduced when the 3derivative of the amplifier voltage transfer curve is zero. Therefore as explained in more detail below with respect to system linearization assembly measures or detects the non linear intermodulation component s in the amplified signal by comparing the amplified signal with the input signal. System linearization assembly then adjusts amplifier bias voltages to minimize or substantially reduce the odd order intermodulation distortion intensity i.e. the non linear intermodulation distortion component based on the determined measurement.

In the exemplary embodiment an attenuation device or attenuator is coupled to delay device and to output bias tee shown in . Attenuation device can be configured to receive an amplified signal from amplifier via output bias tee . Attenuation device can also be configured to attenuate the amplified signal by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of the amplifier . For example attenuating device can attenuate the amplified signal by a factor that is equal to the gain of the amplifier . For example if the gain of the amplifier is 23 dB then the attenuation of attenuating device should be 23 dB.

During operation at least one signal such as an RF signal i.e. input signal is generated by a signal source such as an antenna not shown . At least a portion of the input signal is transmitted from the antenna to input bias tee such that the signal can be amplified and a portion of the input signal is transmitted to delay device . The amplified signal is transmitted to attenuation device . As explained in more detail below with respect to delay device delays the input signal received by a predetermined delay function equal to the delay experienced by the signal as it passes through the signal modifying device such that the phase of the delayed signal and the attenuated signal are equal and attenuation device attenuates the amplified signal by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of amplifier . The attenuated amplified signal and the delayed input signal are transmitted to computing device wherein the attenuated amplified signal is compared with the delayed input signal to obtain a resultant signal that is representative of the non linear intermodulation component s that had been injected into the amplified signal by amplifier . The resultant signal is transmitted to detection device which detects at least one parameter of the signal. Based on the detected parameter controller adjusts the voltages being supplied to input bias tee and to output bias tee by controlling the first power supply and second power supply respectively. When the voltages are adjusted the non linear intermodulation distortion component can be minimized or substantially reduced.

In step delay device delays the input signal by at least a predetermined delay function. For example delay device can delay the input signal by a time measurement such as in milliseconds or microseconds that is equal to the time delay of the signals or an average of the signals passing through amplifier such that the phase of the delayed signal and the attenuated signal are equal. In step attenuation device attenuates the amplified signal by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of amplifier . For example attenuation device can attenuate the amplified signal by a factor that is equal to the gain of the amplifier . When the input signal and the amplified signal are later compared the performance of steps and ensures that the only difference between the input signal and the amplified signal are the non linear components in the amplified signal.

In step delay device transmits the delayed input signal to computing device shown in and in step attenuation device transmits the attenuated amplified signal to computing device . Computing device receives the delayed input signal and the attenuated amplified signal in steps and respectively. In step computing device compares the delayed input signal with the attenuated amplified signal to obtain a resultant signal.

The signal representative of the detected parameter is received by controller in step . Based on the detected parameter controller modifies the output signal by adjusting the voltages or currents being provided to input bias tee shown in and output bias tee . More specifically based on the measured value controller generates control signals in step . These control signals are directed at controlling the controllable voltage or current regulators not shown within first power supply shown in and second power supply shown in such that voltages or currents i.e. DC voltages or currents being supplied by first power supply to input bias tee and by second power supply to output bias tee can be adjusted. In step controller transmits the control signals to first power supply and to second power supply via control interface shown in .

As such the control signals adjust the voltage or current regulators in first power supply and second power supply such that the power being transmitted to input bias tee and to output bias tee respectively is substantially reduced. This reduction enables the non linear intermodulation distortion component s to be decreased or minimized.

In some embodiments controller s response parameters can be optimized and calibrated using a two tone test to maximize system performance. The controller may also be configured to adapt to varying input power levels for instance by adapting to changes in the signal received by detection device . Moreover detection device can be phase sensitive to gain more information about the non linear distortion and to provide more information to controller . For example if detection device is phase sensitive and this phase information is passed or transmitted to controller controller can gain an additional way of knowing which direction to adjust the bias voltages to minimize the non linear component s .

As compared to known systems such as amplifier linearization systems that merely cover or patch non linear intermodulation distortion components within signals to compensate for the effects of the non linear components the embodiments described herein provide a system linearization assembly that can be used with such systems to facilitate a reduction or minimization of the non linear intermodulation distortion components from the system itself. The system linearization assembly is configured to receive an input signal from a signal source and to delay the input signal by a predetermined delay function. The system linearization assembly is also configured to receive a modified output signal from a signal modifying device wherein the modified output signal is based on the input signal and includes a time varying parameter representing a plurality of frequency components including at least one component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. The modified output signal can be attenuated by a factor that is equal to at least one parameter of the signal modifying device and the attenuated modified output signal can be compared with the delayed input signal to obtain a resultant signal that includes the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. At least one parameter of the resultant signal can be detected and the detected parameter can be used to facilitate a modification of the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion. Such a modification enables a reduction or minimization of the component caused by non linear intermodulation distortion from the signal processing system by modifying the signal processing system itself rather than merely covering or patching the non linear intermodulation distortion component to hide its effects.
