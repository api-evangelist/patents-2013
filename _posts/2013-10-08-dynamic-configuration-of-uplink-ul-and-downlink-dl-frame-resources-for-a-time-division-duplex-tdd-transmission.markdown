This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 753 914 filed Jan. 17 2013.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station or a transceiver node and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicate with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

In homogeneous networks the node also called a macro node can provide basic wireless coverage to wireless devices in a cell. The cell can be the area in which the wireless devices are operable to communicate with the macro node. Heterogeneous networks HetNets can be used to handle the increased traffic loads on the macro nodes due to increased density of the cells deployed. HetNets can include a layer of planned high power macro nodes or macro eNBs overlaid with layers of lower power nodes small eNBs micro eNBs pico eNBs femto eNBs or home eNBs HeNBs that can be deployed in a less well planned or even entirely uncoordinated manner within the coverage area cell of a macro node. The lower power nodes LPNs can generally be referred to as low power nodes small nodes or small cells.

The macro node can be used for basic coverage. The low power nodes can be used to fill coverage holes to improve capacity in hot zones or at the boundaries between the macro nodes coverage areas and improve indoor coverage where building structures impede signal transmission. Inter cell interference coordination ICIC or enhanced ICIC eICIC may be used for resource coordination to reduce interference between the nodes such as macro nodes and low power nodes in a HetNet.

Homogeneous networks or HetNets can use time division duplexing TDD or frequency division duplexing FDD for DL or UL transmissions. Time division duplexing TDD is an application of time division multiplexing TDM to separate downlink and uplink signals. In TDD downlink signals and uplink signals may be carried on a same carrier frequency where the downlink signals use a different time interval from the uplink signals so the downlink signals and the uplink signals do not generate interference for each other. TDM is a type of digital multiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals such as a downlink or uplink are transferred apparently simultaneously as sub channels in one communication channel but are physically transmitted on different time resources. In frequency division duplexing FDD an uplink transmission and a downlink transmission can operate using different frequency carriers. In FDD DL UL interference can be avoided because the downlink signals use a different frequency carrier from the uplink signals.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Time division duplex TDD can offer flexible deployments without using a pair of spectrum resources. For TDD deployments interference between uplink UL and downlink DL transmission including both base station to base station BS to BS interference and UE to UE interference can be considered when different uplink downlink UL DL configurations are used among cells in a network.

Allowing adaptive UL DL configurations depending on traffic conditions in different cells can significantly improve the system performance in some examples. illustrates an example where different UL DL configurations can be considered in different cells. Networks e.g. HetNets or homogeneous networks can involve a same carrier or different carriers deployed by a single operator or different operators in the same band and employing either a same or different uplink downlink UL DL configurations. Different UL DL configurations can be used in different cells of the network e.g. HetNet and different carriers deployed by different operators in the same band can be used employing either the same or different uplink downlink configurations. Interference may include adjacent channel interference when different carrier frequencies are used as well as co channel interference when a same carrier frequency is used such as remote node to node interference or BS to BS interference or eNB to eNB interference .

Various radio access technologies RAT such as legacy LTE TDD Release 8 9 10 or 11 and advance LTE TDD Release 12 can support asymmetric UL DL allocations by providing seven different semi statically configured uplink downlink configurations i.e. legacy UL DL TDD configurations . A legacy UL DL TDD configurations can refer to a UL DL TDD configurations as described in LTE TDD Release 8 9 10 or 11. Table 1 illustrates seven UL DL configurations used in LTE where D represents a downlink subframe S represents a special subframe and U represents an uplink subframe. In an example the special subframe can operate or be treated as a downlink subframe.

As illustrated by Table 1 UL DL configuration can include 6 uplink subframes in subframes and and 4 downlink and special subframes in subframes and and UL DL configuration can include one uplink subframe in subframe and 9 downlink and special subframes in subframes .

The legacy LTE UL DL TDD set of configurations can provide DL subframes allocations in the range of 40 to 90 and UL subframes allocations in the range of 10 to 60 as shown in Table 1. A semi static allocation at any given time may not match the instantaneous traffic situation. A mechanism for adapting UL DL allocation can be based on a system information change procedure where the UL and DL subframes allocation within a radio frame can be reconfigured through system information broadcast signaling e.g. a system information block SIB . Hence the UL DL allocation once configured can be expected to vary semi statically. With a mechanism based on the SIB a minimum latency of approximately 640 milliseconds ms can be used for the reconfiguration.

Thus a legacy LTE network may not adapt to a UL DL configuration based on cell specific instantaneous traffic needs. The semi static configuration of the DL and UL frame resources across the whole network may not allow adjusting an amount of the DL and UL resources based on instantaneous traffic needs. The inability to adjust the DL and UL resources based on instantaneous traffic situations may create restriction in small cells deployed in a macro cell coverage area since traffic condition in small cells may vary substantially. Dynamic allocation of the number of the DL and UL frame resources can boost performance of LTE small cells networks operating in the TDD spectrum.

For instance mechanisms can be used to support dynamic allocation of UL and DL subframes with a lower latency e.g. 10 ms such as Flexible Subframes FlexSF as shown in . A flexible subframe is capable of changing an uplink downlink transmission direction for a set of legacy UL DL TDD configurations. For example subframes with a subframe index and can vary between UL or DL subframes in the seven different semi statically configured legacy LTE UL DL TDD configurations . Subframes and can be referred to as fixed subframes since the transmission direction can be fixed as primarily an UL subframe e.g. subframe or a DL subframe e.g. DL subframes and special subframe or DL or special subframe for the seven different semi statically configured legacy LTE UL DL TDD configurations.

The technology e.g. methods computer circuitry nodes configuration devices processors transceivers or UEs described herein can enable dynamic change of subframe types e.g. UL or DL in the legacy UL DL configuration and signaling mechanisms to support dynamic allocation of DL and UL resources in the LTE physical frame structure. The technology can be compatible with a legacy LTE network i.e. LTE Release 8 9 10 or 11 and can have minimal impact on legacy terminals e.g. UEs and can provide lower implementation complexity for the dynamic change. The technology can provide a fast adaptation time scale e.g. 10 ms for dynamic reconfiguration of DL and UL frame resources in LTE TDD small cells.

Advanced UEs e.g. UEs supporting LTE Release 12 features supporting UL DL TDD reconfiguration can dynamically reconfigure the semi statically configured legacy LTE UL DL TDD configurations to another configuration by configuring the FlexSF to a different transmission direction e.g. UL to DL or DL to UL . The FlexSFs can be transparent to legacy UEs using LTE TDD Release 8 9 10 or 11 and the UL or DL configuration of the FlexSFs can be changed semi statically for legacy UEs through system information block type SIB information bits. The node can be responsible to properly schedule the data transmission of legacy UEs to ensure that the corresponding physical uplink shared channel PUSCH and hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement HARQ ACK resources of the physical downlink shared channel PDSCH and the PUSCH still are valid even when the TDD configuration is changed for an advanced UE supporting FlexSFs.

A downlink signal or channel can include data on a Physical Downlink Shared CHannel PDSCH or control information on a Physical Downlink Control CHannel PDCCH . A PDCCH or enhanced PDCCH can carry a message known as Downlink Control Information DCI which can includes transmission resource assignments such as a PDSCH orPUSCH and other control information for a UE or group of UEs. Many PDCCHs can be transmitted in a subframe. An uplink signal or channel can include data on a Physical Uplink Shared CHannel PUSCH or control information on a Physical Uplink Control CHannel PUCCH . Automatic Repeat reQuest is a feedback mechanism whereby a receiving terminal requests retransmission of packets which are detected to be erroneous. Hybrid ARQ is a simultaneous combination of Automatic Retransmission reQuest ARQ and forward error correction FEC . When HARQ is used and if the errors can be corrected by FEC then no whole retransmission may be requested otherwise if the errors can be detected but not corrected a whole retransmission can be requested. An ACKnowledgment ACK signal can be transmitted to indicate that one or more blocks of data such as in a PDSCH have been successfully received and decoded. HARQ ACK Negative ACKnowledgment NACK or NAK information can include feedback from a receiver to the transmitter in order to acknowledge a correct reception of a packet or ask for a new retransmission via NACK or NAK . A PDSCH HARQ can be transmitted in an uplink subframe after a PDSCH in a downlink subframe and a PUSCH HARQ can be transmitted in a downlink subframe after a PUSCH in an uplink subframe. In a legacy system the timing relation between the DL UL grant the DL UL data allocation and the DL UL HARQ feedbacks may be predetermined.

In legacy LTE each of the seven semi statically configured UL DL TDD configurations can have PDSCH HARQ timings corresponding to UL subframes and PUSCH scheduling timings and PUSCH HARQ timings corresponding to DL subframes. For example Table 2 illustrates the PDSCH HARQ timing for seven UL DL configurations used in LTE as illustrated in . A PDSCH transmission can be indicated by the detection of corresponding PDCCH or a PDCCH indicating downlink SPS release within subframe s n k where k K and K defined in Table 2 also shown in Table 10.1.3.1 1 3GPP technical specification TS 36.213 V11.0.0 2012 09 is a set of M elements k k . . . k depending on the subframe n. For instance an uplink subframe n in Table 2 can be used to transmit PDSCH HARQ ACK s for PDSCH in subframe s n k.

For example in TDD configuration indicated by the SIB a UL subframe can provide a PDSCH HARQ ACK for DL subframes and of a prior radio frame a UL subframe can provide a PDSCH HARQ ACK for DL subframe of the prior frame UL subframe can provide a PDSCH HARQ ACK for DL subframes and of the prior frame and UL subframe can provide a PDSCH HARQ ACK for DL subframe of the prior frame. In an example at least four subframes may occur between a downlink subframe and an uplink subframe to allow for transmission decoding and processing of the downlink transmission PDCCH and or uplink transmission.

Table 3 illustrates the PUSCH scheduling timing for seven UL DL configurations used in LTE. For UL reference UL DL configurations belonging to 1 2 3 4 5 6 and a normal HARQ operation the UE can upon detection of a PDCCH or enhanced physical downlink control channels EPDCCH or ePDCCH with an uplink DCI format and or a physical hybrid automatic repeat request ARQ indicator channel PHICH transmission in subframe n intended for the UE adjust a corresponding PUSCH transmission in subframe n k with k given in Table 3 also shown in Table 8 2 3GPP technical specification TS 36.213 V11.0.0 2012 09 according to the PDCCH EPDCCH information and the PHICH information. Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator CHannel PHICH is a downlink physical channel which carries the HARQ ACK NACK information indicating whether the node has correctly received a transmission on the PUSCH. For UL reference UL DL configuration and normal HARQ operation a least significant bit LSB of the UL index in the DCI format 0 4 can be set to 1 in subframe n or a PHICH can be received in subframe n 0 or 5 in the resource corresponding to I 1 or PHICH can be received in subframe n 1 or 6 the UE can adjust the corresponding PUSCH transmission in subframe n 7.

For example in TDD configuration indicated by the SIB a DL subframe can schedule a PUSCH in a UL subframe a DL subframe can schedule a PUSCH in a UL subframe a DL subframe can schedule a PUSCH in a UL subframe of a subsequent radio frame and a DL subframe can schedule a PUSCH in UL subframe of a subsequent frame. In an example at least four subframes may occur between a downlink subframe and an uplink subframe to allow for transmission decoding and processing of the downlink transmission PDCCH and or uplink transmission.

Table 4 illustrates the PUSCH HARQ timing for seven UL DL configurations used in LTE. For PUSCH transmissions scheduled from serving cell c in subframe n a UE can determine the corresponding PHICH resource of a serving cell c in subframe n k where kis given in Table 4 also shown in Table 9.1.2 1 3GPP technical specification TS 36.213 V11.0.0 2012 09 .

For example in TDD configuration indicated by the SIB a PUSCH HARQ ACK for a UL subframe can be transmitted in a DL subframe a PUSCH HARQ ACK for a UL subframe can be transmitted in a DL subframe a PUSCH HARQ ACK for a UL subframe can be transmitted in a DL subframe of a subsequent radio frame and a PUSCH HARQ ACK for a UL subframe can be transmitted in a DL subframe of a subsequent frame. In an example at least four subframes may occur between an uplink subframe and a downlink subframe to allow for decoding and processing of the downlink transmission uplink transmission and or PHICH.

The dynamic reconfiguration technology e.g. methods computer circuitry nodes configuration devices processors transceivers or UEs described herein can provide a dynamic reconfiguration of UL DL TDD configurations with minimum changes to the UE terminal and to the LTE specification while preserving full flexibility in terms of traffic adaptation capabilities. In addition the technology may not add new physical PHY layer signaling or change PHY layer signaling to support fast adaptation time scale in the order of 10 ms.

In an example the technology may use existing legacy LTE UL DL configurations without adding new UL DL configurations. Legacy UEs e.g. LTE Release 8 11 UEs can operate using semi static UL DL configuration broadcasted in SIB so the dynamic reconfiguration has minimal to no impact on legacy UE behavior. The dynamic reconfiguration technology can support a fast adaptation time scale for advanced UEs e.g. LTE Release 12 UEs without the introduction of additional physical layer signaling and without changes in the LTE PHY physical structure. The dynamic reconfiguration technology can reuse HARQ operation timelines defined for legacy UEs and preserve flexible traffic adaptation capabilities in small cells.

The dynamic reconfiguration technology can utilize the flexible subframe FlexSF mechanism as illustrated by . In LTE TDD systems with dynamic UL DL reconfiguration the subframes may be classified in accordance with their possibility to change the transmission directions between legacy LTE UL DL configurations. For example subframes and for the 7 legacy LTE UL DL configurations can be classified as regular or static DL subframes i.e. including DL and special subframes because these subframes may not change from the DL transmission direction. Subframe for the 7 legacy LTE UL DL configurations can be classified as a regular or static UL subframe because subframe may not change from the UL transmission direction. Subframes and for the 7 legacy LTE UL DL configurations can be classified as flexible because these subframes can be configured as a DL subframe or an UL subframe i.e. changed transmission direction from DL to UL or UL to DL for the 7 legacy LTE UL DL configurations depending on the legacy LTE UL DL configuration.

For example subframe can be configured as an UL subframe for LTE UL DL configurations and or configured as a DL subframe for LTE UL DL configurations and . illustrates the transmission directions of the flexible subframes for the 7 legacy LTE UL DL configurations i.e. LTE UL DL configuration .

In another example the transmission direction of flexible subframes configured as UL i.e. subframes and by UL DL configuration in the SIB may be changed to DL for advanced UEs. The dynamic reconfiguration of advanced UEs can imply compliant operation of legacy UEs since if the legacy UEs are not scheduled or configured for transmission of the UL signal the legacy UEs can just skip the UL subframe. In addition the dynamic reconfiguration of advanced UEs may not have an impact on the traffic adaptation characteristics if a serving cell is configured with a UL favored UL DL configuration e.g. UL DL configuration since each flexible subframe can dynamically change transmission direction from UL to DL and back to UL as illustrated in .

By default UEs in the network may follow the legacy behavior in accordance with the UL DL configuration broadcasted in the SIB. If the network determines that dynamic resource allocations e.g. traffic asymmetry can improve traffic conditions the network e.g. via the eNB can configure served advanced UEs to operate in dynamic mode that supports reconfiguration of the subframe type. Higher layer signaling e.g. radio resource control RRC signaling or physical layer signaling can be used to activate a dynamic UL DL configuration mode for the advanced UEs linked to the cell e.g. using cell specific mechanism . Activation of a dynamic UL DL configuration mode for the advanced UEs can be performed in UE specific way so that each advanced UE may be independently configured to start operation in dynamic UL DL reconfiguration mode. The dynamic UL DL configuration mode can be activated using a UL DL reconfiguration indicator. For instance the DCI e.g. a DL DCI grant or an UL DCI grant or RRC signaling can carry the UL DL reconfiguration indicator and can be used to activate the dynamic UL DL reconfiguration mode in a UE specific way. The activation of the dynamic UL DL reconfiguration mode can be acknowledged by the eNB so that no ambiguity exists between the eNB and UE in terms of UL DL operation in subsequent subframes. ACK NACK signaling can be used for dynamic UL DL reconfiguration mode acknowledgements. A legacy UE may not provide an ACK or may not have capability to provide an ACK.

A default number of DL subframes for a radio frame can be controlled by a UL DL configuration broadcasted in SIB. The dynamic UL DL reconfiguration technology can provide a mechanism for determining which subframes can be treated or used as additional DL subframes for advanced UEs with dynamic UL DL reconfiguration capabilities. In an example the UL DL reconfiguration indicator can indicate the set of additional flexible subframes to be configured as DL subframes using an existing set of UL DL reconfigurations. For instance UL favored UL DL configuration can be configured by RRC signaling or the UL favored UL DL configuration can be set via the SIB or associated with UL DL configuration broadcasted by SIB as illustrated in . The DL favored UL DL configuration can also be configured by RRC signaling. The UL DL reconfiguration indicator can configure subframes and as DL subframes e.g. switching transmission direction from UL to DL which can dynamically change the radio frame from the legacy LTE UL DL configuration to the legacy LTE UL DL configuration where subframe is reconfigured from the DL favored UL DL configuration. In another configuration the DL favored UL DL configuration along with the UL DL reconfiguration indicator can configure subframe as a UL subframe e.g. switching transmission direction from DL to UL which can dynamically change the radio frame from the DL favored UL DL configuration to the legacy LTE UL DL configuration . In another example the UL DL reconfiguration indicator may not configure subframe as a DL subframe while leaving subframe as an UL subframe since the UL DL configuration does not correspond to one of the 7 legacy LTE UL DL configurations. The UL DL reconfiguration indicator can be used to dynamically configure the advanced UE from one legacy LTE UL DL configuration to another legacy LTE UL DL configuration without a change in the SIB.

In another example the network may use the existing set of legacy LTE UL DL configurations and instruct the advanced UE to use a DL favored UL DL configuration with a specified number of DL subframes e.g. legacy LTE UL DL configuration in . The DL favored UL DL configuration may be signaled in a semi static way e.g. RRC signaling and updated non frequently. Once the advanced UE has been configured with the additional DL favored UL DL configuration by eNB the advanced UE can assume that the additional set of DL flexible subframes is available for future operations. Thus the advanced UEs may start to monitor these flexible subframes for DL grants and allocations of data transmission. Thus the UL favored UL DL configuration and DL favored UL DL configuration can provide the bounds on the number of flexible subframes to monitor for DL grants and allocations of data transmission. For instance as illustrated in the UL favored UL DL configuration can be the legacy LTE UL DL configuration and the DL favored UL DL configuration can be the legacy LTE UL DL configuration so all 7 legacy LTE UL DL configurations can be available for dynamic reconfiguration and the advanced UE may monitor subframes and for DL grants and allocations of data transmission. In another example the UL favored UL DL configuration can be the legacy LTE UL DL configuration and the DL favored UL DL configuration can be the legacy LTE UL DL configuration so legacy LTE UL DL configurations i.e. legacy LTE UL DL configurations and can be available for dynamic reconfiguration and the advanced UE may monitor subframes and for DL grants and allocations of data transmission. Configuring the UL favored UL DL configuration and the DL favored UL DL configuration can provide reservation of the DL flexible subframes .

A dynamic change of DL flexible subframes to UL subframes may use various scheduling mechanisms. The DL DCI grants can schedule DL data allocation for the subframes where DL grants are transmitted. Thus if the eNB determines to use a legacy UL subframe for the DL data transmission to one of its advanced UEs configured in dynamic operation mode the eNB can just schedule DL grant in one of the monitored DL flexible subframes e.g. send a downlink DCI grant .

If the eNB determines to use the DL flexible subframe as an UL subframe at least two options are available. In an option the eNB can use existing DCI messages and allocate a UL grant in one of the preceding subframes to schedule the UL transmissions in one of the DL flexible subframes . For legacy UEs the DL flexible subframes can be interpreted as UL subframes as illustrated by legacy LTE UL DL configuration in . For legacy and advanced UEs the eNB may use preceding DL subframes for scheduling the UL grant. Thus the eNB may use the same subframes to allocate UL grant for advanced UE configured in dynamic mode or legacy UEs. If an allocated UL grant points to one of the DL flexible subframe then the UE can interpret the flexible subframe as a UL subframe and prepare data for future transmission at the flexible subframe. An advantage of using existing DCI messages is that UL grants for dynamic mode may not have any changes in the existing DCI messages and may also be implemented using existing legacy HARQ timelines.

In another option a new DCI message e.g. including a UL DL reconfiguration indicator may be introduced to indicate that particular DL subframe can be interpreted as a UL and used for UL transmission. Using a new DCI message e.g. different DCI message type may define a new HARQ timeline. This DCI message may carry UL DL configuration to be applied in the current or the next frame and may be carried out in one of the static DL subframes. This new UL DL configuration can be a subset of legacy UL DL configurations and may have less number of DL subframes compared to the configured DL favored UL DL configuration.

The LTE HARQ timing or HARQ timeline can assume asynchronous operation in a DL data transmission and synchronous operation in a UL data transmission. For instance a fixed time may exist between a DL scheduling grant and UL HARQ feedback i.e. DL data transmission however no strict timing relationship may exist for a DL retransmission of data. For uplink operation i.e. UL data transmission the allocation of a UL grant a UL transmission and DL HARQ feedback can be determined by strict timing relationships which can depend on the UL DL configuration broadcasted in SIB.

For network systems with dynamic assignment of UL and DL resources the legacy HARQ timelines may be modified since the subframes may dynamically change transmission direction. Generating new HARQ timelines can introduce additional complexity at the UE terminal and eNodeB sides. Configuring a terminal e.g. UE with UE specific timelines for DL and UL HARQ operation e.g. reusing legacy HARQ timelines for the various dynamically configured LTE UL DL configurations can remove some complexity in the implementation of the HARQ timelines and provide a simpler solution to DL and UL HARQ operation in case of dynamic UL DL reconfiguration. To enable dynamic UL DL reconfiguration for advanced UEs existing HARQ timelines can be reused by configuring two independent HARQ timelines one HARQ timeline for UL operation and one HARQ timeline for DL operation as illustrated in . These UL DL configurations may be independently configured for each UE in the cell which can be overlaid on the legacy UL DL configuration. The configuration of the UL favored and DL favored UL DL configurations can automatically change the number of the HARQ processes that are available for operation of the advanced UEs. The number of DL HARQ processes may be defined by the DL favored UL DL configuration according to the specification e.g. Table 2 for the LTE specification . The number of UL HARQ processes may be defined by UL favored UL DL configuration according to the specification e.g. Table 4 for the LTE specification .

In an example the UL HARQ timeline may be set to a same UL HARQ timeline as defined by the UL DL configuration transmitted in SIB for legacy UEs i.e. the same HARQ timeline may be used for UL HARQ operation . In another example the DL HARQ timeline may be configured by higher level signaling e.g. RRC signaling . illustrates an example of a modified HARQ timing operation along with a PUSCH transmission timing for the case of the UL favored LTE UL DL configuration and the DL favored LTE UL DL configuration . For instance the DL configured subframes can use the DL favored UL DL configuration for the DL channel timing such as a PDSCH scheduling grant transmission timing a PDSCH transmission timing and a PDSCH HARQ feedback timing e.g. Table 2 . The UL configured subframes can use the UL favored UL DL configuration for the UL channel timing such as a PUSCH scheduling grant timing a PUSCH transmission timing e.g. Table 3 a PUSCH HARQ feedback timing e.g. Table 4 and a PUSCH HARQ retransmission timing. For the advanced UE dynamic UL DL configuration the DL subframe can use the DL channel timing and while the UL configured flexible subframe can use the UL channel timing and . Many different combinations and variations can exist using the principles illustrated.

The dynamic reconfiguration technology described herein can provide various advantages and benefits to the LTE TDD systems. For example the technology described can enable fast traffic adaptation capabilities by dynamically changing the amount of DL and UL resources. No additional physical layer signaling may be needed while still supporting a fast 10 ms adaptation time scale which can provide improved performance benefits. The technology described can provide legacy e.g. LTE Release 11 compatible operation with dynamic UL DL reconfiguration for legacy and advanced LTE Release12 UE or terminals . The technology described can reuse existing HARQ timelines with flexible traffic adaptation capabilities. The technology described may not introduce new UL DL configuration to the LTE system however the technology can be extended to support new UL DL configurations with some minor changes e.g. HARQ timing handling .

Another example provides a method for dynamically reconfiguring an uplink downlink UL DL time division duplexing TDD configuration by an evolved Node B eNB as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine computer circuitry or a processor for the UE where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The method includes the operation of configuring a user equipment UE using a semi static UL DL TDD configuration belonging to a set of legacy UL DL TDD configurations as in block . The next operation of the method can be activating a dynamic UL DL reconfiguration mode when additional DL or UL resources are needed for data traffic as in block . The method can further include dynamically reconfiguring the semi static UL DL TDD configuration to another legacy UL DL TDD configuration using a UL DL reconfiguration indicator to change an UL DL transmission direction of a flexible subframe FlexSF wherein the flexible subframe is capable of changing an uplink downlink transmission direction for a set of legacy UL DL TDD configurations as in block .

In an example the operation of dynamically reconfiguring the semi static UL DL TDD configuration to the other legacy UL DL TDD configuration can further include reconfiguring a DL channel timing based on a DL favored UL DL configuration reconfiguring an UL channel timing based on a UL favored UL DL configuration and communicating a HARQ feedback for subframes in a frame using the DL channel timing or the UL channel timing respectively. The DL favored UL DL configuration can include more DL subframes than a semi static UL DL TDD configuration for the UE and the DL channel timing can include a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH scheduling grant transmission timing e.g. in a PDSCH transmission timing e.g. in and a PDSCH hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ feedback timing e.g. in Table 2 . The UL favored UL DL configuration can include more UL subframes than a semi static UL DL TDD configuration for the UE or is identical to the semi static UL DL TDD configuration broadcasted by the SIB and the UL channel timing can include a physical uplink shared channel PUSCH scheduling grant timing e.g. in a PUSCH transmission timing e.g. in Table 3 a PUSCH HARQ feedback timing e.g. in Table 4 and a PUSCH HARQ retransmission timing.

An LTE UL DL configuration provides the DL favored UL DL configuration for UL DL configurations and and the UL favored UL DL configuration for UL DL configurations and .

An LTE UL DL configuration provides the DL favored UL DL configuration for UL DL configurations and . An LTE UL DL configuration provides the DL favored UL DL configuration for UL DL configuration and the UL favored UL DL configuration for UL DL configuration and .

In another configuration the operation of configuring the UE using the semi static UL DL TDD configuration can further include broadcasting the semi static UL DL TDD configuration to the UE via a system information block type SIB . In another example the UL DL reconfiguration indicator can be indicated using a DL downlink control information DCI grant or an UL DCI grant in a DCI grant subframe.
