This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 899 093 filed May 21 2013 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETERMINING AN OBJECTIVE SECURITY ASSESSMENT FOR A NETWORK OF ASSETS by HD Moore Roy Donald Hodgman Dana Elizabeth Wolf and Matthew Robert Hathaway the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In today s distributed computing environments security is of the utmost importance. Due to the rise of wide area public networks users have unlimited access to content e.g. data files applications programs etc. from a variety of sources. Additionally the users connection to the public networks provides a window for malicious entities to attack the users computing systems. Malicious entities utilize this ease of accessibility and anonymity to attack the users. For example the malicious entities can plant viruses Trojans or other malicious agents in publicly available content in order to attack the users computing systems and steal sensitive information from the users and can attack the users system remotely across the public networks.

To identify security risks in computing systems and networks users and administrators employ vulnerability assessment and security assessment tools. These tools can identify vulnerabilities in computing systems and networks but only provide discrete information about the vulnerabilities i.e. that a vulnerability exists . Accordingly the tools do not provide any assessment of the vulnerabilities within the context of the overall network security.

For simplicity and illustrative purposes the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to examples of various implementations thereof. However one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to and can be implemented in all types of information and systems and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover in the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying figures which illustrate specific examples of various implementations. Electrical mechanical logical and structural changes can be made to the examples of the various implementations without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.

As described herein the security assessment tool will be described with reference to a user interacting with the security assessment tool . In implementations a user can include a one or more persons and or one or more software programs that can interact with the security assessment tool .

In implementations a user can utilize the interface interact with the security assessment tool to perform the overall security assessment. The user can utilize the interface to initiate a security assessment of the network environment . The user can utilize the interface to enter information about the network environment and the computer assets . For example the user can enter information about the structure of the network environment such as network addresses of the network environment . Likewise for example the user can enter information about the computer assets such as identification of the computer assets access information for the computer assets and the like. The security assessment tool for example the scanner can utilize the information provided by the user when identifying the computer assets and when determining the security information for the network environment .

The security assessment tool can utilize the interface to output the results of the overall security assessment. The results can include the security score relative to the potential security threats and the overall security score determined by the security assessment tool . The results can also include one or more recommendations for improving the security score relative to the potential security threats and the overall security score. For example the one or more recommendations can include deploying a new counter measure changing a security setting of the computer assets changing a system setting of the computer assets changing a security policy of the computer systems updating software of the computer assets installing security software on the computer assets and improving access information for the computer assets .

As illustrated the security assessment tool can be configured to access one or more security resources . The security resources can be a source whether internal or external to the network environment that provides information about security threats and counter measures. For example the security resources can include security experts security forums security literature empirical security testing platforms and the like. Likewise for example the security resource can include the user of the security assessment tool . The security assessment tool can utilize the security resources to generate and update the threat model . The security assessment tool can also utilize the security resources to generate and update the score model . For example the security assessment tool can utilize the security resources to determine effectiveness metrics for the counter measures. The effectiveness metrics can be utilized to determine and update the weighting values for the counter measures.

As illustrated at the process can begin. At the security assessment tool can determine the computer assets in the network environment . The security assessment tool can scan the network environment to identify the computer assets in the network environment . Likewise the security assessment tool can receive an identification of computer assets from a user of the security assessment tool . Additionally the security assessment tool can receive from a user information about the network environment and the computer assets to assist in scanning the network environment .

In the security assessment tool can determine an actual deployment of counter measures on the computer assets. To determine the actual deployment of the counter measurers the security assessment tool can determine security information of the network environment . The security assessment tool can scan the network environment and the computer assets to identify security information. Likewise the security assessment tool can receive the security information from a user of the security assessment tool . Additionally the security assessment tool can receive from a user information about the network environment and the computer assets to assist in scanning the network environment .

The security information can include any information about the structure of the network environment and any information about the computer assets . For example the security information can include security details of the network environment such as security polices of the network environment details of computer assets e.g. firewalls providing security in the network environment and the like. Likewise for example the security information can include security details of the computer assets such as the configuration of the computer assets system setting of the computer assets software programs including security software programs installed on the computer assets security settings of the computer assets configuration policies of the computer assets security policies of the computer assets access information for the computer assets and details of software programs installed on the computer assets.

Once the security information is determined the security assessment tool can determine potential security threats to the network and determine counter measures to address the potential security threats. Based on the security information the security assessment tool can examine the threat model to identify the potential security threats to the network environment . Additionally from the threat model the security assessment tool can identify counter measure that can address the potential security threats to the network environment .

For example based on the type and configurations of computer assets the security assessment tool can determine potential security threats. For instance if one or more of the computer assets are running a particular OS or a particular software program the security assessment tool can determine any potential security threats and any counter measures that are applicable to the particular OS or software program. Likewise for instance if one or more of the computer assets are connected to a public network e.g. the internet the security assessment tool can determine any potential security threats and any counter measures that are associated with public networks.

Then the security assessment tool can determine an actual deployment of the counter measures in the network. Based on the security information and potential security threats the security assessment tool can determine which counter measures are actually deployed in the network environment and on the computer assets . The security assessment tool can determine which of counter measures are deployed and the coverage of the counter measures e.g. on which computer assets are the counter measures deployed .

In the security assessment tool can determine an overall security score for the network based on the actual deployment of the counter measures potential security threats and an effectiveness of the counter measures. The security assessment tool can determine the overall security score based on potential security threats to the network environment the actual deployment of the counter measures in the network environment and effectiveness on the deployed counter measures. The overall security score can include security scores for different security threats. The security score for each security threat can reflect the actual deployment of counter measures for each counter measure and the effectiveness of the deployed counter measures. The overall security score can be the combination of the security scores for each potential security threat.

The security score for each potential security threat and the overall security score can be a numerical value that represents the overall security score for the network environment where a higher numerical value represents better security relative to lower numerical values. For example the security score for each potential security threat and overall security score can be a numerical value between 0 and 10 where 0 represents no security for potential security threats and 10 represents complete coverage for the potential security threats. For instance if for a particular security threat the network environment has deployed on 100 of the computer assets a counter measure that is 50 effective in mitigating a the particular security threat. In this instance the security assessment tool can determine that the overall security score is 5.

The above describes an example of the general process for determining the overall security score. A complete description of examples of determining the security score can be found in the related application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 899 093 filed May 21 2013 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DETERMINING AN OBJECTIVE SECURITY ASSESSMENT FOR A NETWORK OF ASSETS by HD Moore Roy Donald Hodgman Dana Elizabeth Wolf and Matthew Robert Hathaway the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
