Resource Watermarking and Management provides associating watermark templates with resources associated with a device. Additionally watermarked resource management provides logging events related to watermarked resources. In some situations devices may seek to perform actions on resources that are not watermarked which may be problematic as certain resources are sensitive and must not be freely utilized. Conventional approaches address this problem by relying on the user of a device to manually watermark resources before performing actions on the resources.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is neither intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is this Summary intended to limit the claimed subject matter s scope.

Resource watermarking and management may be provided. Information Technology IT administrators may secure resources by permanently altering the resources to include a watermark template that identifies and or describes the resources as sensitive. This process may be implemented through a method that identifies resources identifies watermark templates associates the watermark templates with the resources and authorizes user devices to perform actions on the resources. The watermark templates may include user information device information affiliated enterprise information etc. that may assist in securing the resources were they to fall into the wrong hands. Examples may include statements of confidentiality and ownership identities of users that shared the resources the state of security settings on user devices that have accessed the resources and or the like. Once a watermark template is applied to a resource and or once a user device performs an action on a resource with a watermark template an event log may be created and distributed as necessary to support remote management of the respective resources and or user devices. For example the user device may communicate an event log to one and or more management servers affiliated with an enterprise that provides the user device with access to resources that are associated with watermark templates.

More specifically resources may include at least one of the following file types data files audio files video files three dimensional image files raster image files vector image files page layout files spreadsheet files database files executable files CAD files web files plug in files font files system files settings files encoded files compressed files disk image files developer files backup files and or any other files.

User device may further store at least one watermark template in the data store . Watermark template may include an arrangement of data and or a file containing such arranged data. In some embodiments a watermark template may be associated with and or applicable to one and or more of the following a resource a user device and a user of a user device . For example an administrator of a watermark template server may designate certain resources user devices and or users of user devices to be associated with a certain watermark template as described herein. Additionally a watermark template may include data affiliated with and or describing resources user devices and or users of user devices based on the watermark template being associated with such resources user devices and or users of user devices . As an example a watermark template may be associated with a user device in response to the user device creating a resource that is associated with the watermark template . In such scenario the watermark template may include descriptive data related to the associated user device for instance specifying a device identifier of the associated user device and an indication that such user device created the resource associated with the watermark template . As another example a watermark template may be associated with a user device in response to the user device requesting access to a resource associated with the watermark template .

In some embodiments a watermark template may include a plurality of descriptive data such as text describing one or more resources user devices and or users of user devices associated with the watermark template . Descriptive data may include for instance one and or more properties associated with such resources properties associated with such user devices user identifiers associated with such users of user devices source identifiers associated with source user devices and or users of user devices a timestamp associated with an action performed on such resources and a location associated with an action performed on such resources . Properties associated with resources may include for instance one and or more prior actions taken on such resources sensitivity levels of such resources and or security requirements associated with such resources as described herein. Properties associated with user devices may include for example one and or more device identifiers device hardware features device software features device applications current times current locations and home locations associated with such user devices . For instance descriptive data may include a listing of hardware features active and or accessible on a user device at the current time a current location of the user device and a home location of the user device such as the geographic location of an enterprise providing the user device with access to a resource associated with the respective watermark template . Source user devices and or users of user devices may include for instance user devices and or users of user devices that provided the respective resource to the user device that is currently performing an action on the respective resource such as storing the respective resource . As an example a source user device may be include a user identifier specifying a user of a user device that emailed a resource to another user of a user device .

In certain embodiments a watermark template may include descriptive data that is determined and or identified at the time the watermark template is to be utilized. In particular a watermark template may be dynamically composed such that the watermark template includes dynamic descriptive data that is accurate at the time the watermark template is viewed applied and or otherwise used by a user device . In some embodiments a watermark template may acquire dynamic descriptive data with the assistance of a user device communicatively coupled to the watermark template such as via an agent application and or via an application programming interface as later described with respect to .

Dynamic descriptive data may include and or describe for example a prior action type taken on a resource such as a prior creation prior access prior modification prior storage and prior transmission of the resource by a user device and or user of a user device . A transmission of a resource may for instance include transmitting the resource via a sharing feature an email an instant message a text and or multimedia message a social media application a FTP server and or other means of transmitting resources between user devices . In some embodiments a watermark template may describe such prior actions by including descriptive data detailing one and or more user identifiers source identifiers timestamps locations prior action types contextual details describing such prior actions a property associated with a user device associated with such prior actions. Timestamps may for instance specify a date and or time associated with the timestamp such as the date and time when a resource was shared by a certain user device a date and time when the resource was received from the sharing user device by a recipient user device a date and time when the recipient user device will cease to be authorized to perform actions on the resource and or a date and time when the resource will expire and or become inaccessible by user devices . A timestamp may further for example specify the context of the timestamp so as to describe the context of such dates and or times. Contextual details describing such prior actions may include for example whether the associated user device complied with one and or more compliance rules associated with such prior actions as described herein.

A watermark template may further include descriptive data that is static and or does not change with respect to a resource user device and or user of a user device . In some embodiments static descriptive data may be pre configured by an administrator of a watermark template server as described herein. Static descriptive data may for instance specify a sensitivity level associated with a certain resource associated with the respective watermark template . Sensitivity levels associated with a resource may specify that the resource is one and or more of the following confidential proprietary privileged and managed. For example a resource that contains financial data may be associated with both a confidential sensitivity level and a proprietary sensitivity level. A privileged sensitivity level may for instance indicate that the respective resource is subject to and or protected by an attorney client relationship and or the work product doctrine. A managed sensitivity level may for example indicate that the respective resource is managed and or controlled by a resource server as described herein. More particularly a managed sensitivity level may describe an enterprise and or business that owns and or controls the respective resource which may also own and or control a resource server associated with and or communicatively coupled to the respective resource . Static descriptive data may also for instance specify a security requirement associated with a certain resource associated with the respective watermark template . Security requirements may specify for instance certain authorized and or unauthorized user identities device identities device hardware features device software features device applications action performance times and or durations and action performance locations. In other words security requirements may specify positive and negative criteria required for a certain user device to perform a certain action on a resource associated with such security requirements. User identities and device identities may include user identifiers and device identifiers respectively. In certain embodiments security requirements are expressed and or enforced via compliance rules associated with one or more user devices subject to the security requirements as described herein.

In some embodiments an administrator associated with a watermark template may configure the watermark template to include certain descriptive text in certain locations amongst the watermark template . As an example a watermark template associated with a resource may be configured to position a title associated with the resource in the upper left corner of the watermark template . The watermark template may be further configured to position a current timestamp associated with an initial creation of the resource in the upper right hand corner of the watermark template . The watermark template may yet further be configured to position a device identifier associated with a user device requesting to share and or transmit an associated resource in the lower left hand corner of the watermark template . The watermark template may even yet further be configured to position a user identifier associated with a user of a user device to whom an associated resource is being shared in the lower right hand corner of the watermark template . Finally the watermark template may be configured to position a statement of confidentiality in translucent font diagonally across the length the watermark template which may clearly identify a sensitivity level associated with the watermark template and or any associated resources .

In some embodiments a watermark template need not comprise a visible indicator. For example an audio resource may be associated with an audio watermark template comprising a configurable message concatenated onto the audio resource at the beginning of the existing audio within the existing audio and or at the end of the existing audio of the audio resource . Additionally an audio resource may be associated with an audio watermark template comprising an audio marker that may be heard concurrently with the existing audio of the audio resource . Such an audio watermark may comprise a spoken audio and or a non spoken audio such as a public domain trademarked and or copyrighted musical selection associated with an enterprise associated with the watermark template .

In some embodiments a user device may associate and or unite a watermark template with a resource . In particular a watermark template may be overlaid and or superimposed onto a resource such that the watermark template and the resource are united when viewed by a human being. For example a resource may be modified such that a plurality of descriptive text of a watermark template may be visible on the resource . Furthermore the resource may appear largely the same as before the watermark template is overlaid and or superimposed onto the resource as the watermark template may include a translucent body and or background that may allow the underlying resource to remain visible amongst the plurality of descriptive text of the watermark template . In certain embodiments a resource may be marked and or badged with Watermarked and or the like to indicate that the resource is associated with a watermark template . Similarly a resource may be marked and or badged with indicia of an action that triggered a watermark template to become associated with such resource in accordance with a compliance rule associated with the resource and or user device such as by placing a diagonal badge across the upper left corner of an icon of the resource stating Shared to indicate that the resource was watermarked in response the resource being shared with another user device. For instance a resource may be marked and or badged on the icon representing the resource in the finder and or desktop of the user device .

In some embodiments the manner of which a user device associates a watermark template with a resource may be based at least in part on the type of resource that will be associated with the watermark template . For example an image resource may have a watermark template superimposed on the image resource such that the watermark template and the underlying image are concurrently visible as described herein. As another example an email resource may have a watermark template displayed as an overlay and or underlay to the email resource and or the watermark template may be included as a header and or signature to the email resource . As a further example a word processing spreadsheet and or presentation productivity resource may comprise a watermark template in one and or more of the following displayer in a header and or footer section of the productivity resource incorporated as visible and or non visible metadata in the productivity resource and or displayed as an overlay underlay and or adjacent image to at least a portion of the content of the productivity resource . For instance metadata may be incorporated in a resource by one and or more of attaching the metadata to the resource and placing the metadata in a header of the resource with locked editing. In some embodiments a watermark template may be repeated so as to be visible and or affixed in at least one of the above manners on each page slide worksheet etc. of the productivity resource .

In certain embodiments a watermark template may be permanently associated and or united with a resource . For example a resource may be permanently modified such that descriptive text of a watermark template cannot be removed from the resource . Furthermore a series of watermark templates may be associated with a resource over the lifespan of the resource such that a watermark template is associated with a resource with one or more previously associated watermark templates . For instance watermark templates may be associated with resources according to a plurality of compliance rules as described herein such that a watermark template is associated with the resources upon certain actions being taken with respect to the resources . More specifically a watermark template may be associated with a resource each time a user device seeks to share the resource where the associated watermark template may be dynamically populated based on a current context such as a current location a current timestamp or a device identifier associated with the sharing functionality request.

In certain instances it may be determined whether any changes have occurred to a resource before a new watermark template is applied to the resource with previously associated watermark templates . For example it may be determined whether a resource needs a new watermark template applied based at least in part on one and or more of OCR ing the resource to determining whether the resource has changed since the last version and comparing a watermark template comprising a hash checksum of the OCR d text to determine whether the resource was altered annotated and or otherwise modified.

Some descriptive data included in a watermark template may be static such as the title of a resource and a current timestamp associated with an initial creation of the resource and may therefore remain the same each time the watermark template is associated with a resource . However some descriptive data included in a watermark template may be dynamic such as a property associated with a resource and a property associated with a user device and may therefore update each time the watermark template is associated with a resource . For instance the watermark template may be updated upon each association with a resource based at least in part on a device profile and or a resource . In some embodiments a resource may be associated with all watermark templates previously associated with the resource such that all descriptive text associated with the resource over the lifespan of the resource is included in the current version of the resource . In particular a resource may be layered with many watermark templates and may thereby provide a history of the resource . For instance a resource may include descriptive data of a first watermark template after the first watermark template is associated with the resource the resource may include descriptive data of the first watermark template and descriptive data of a second watermark template after the second watermark template is associated with the resource and so on. Alternatively in some embodiments a resource may only be associated with a newly associated watermark template thereby removing any previously associated watermark templates from the resource .

Moreover user device may store one or more compliance rules . Compliance rules may be associated with one and or more of certain user devices certain users of user devices and certain resources . For instance compliance rules may be associated with certain resources when certain users of certain user devices request and or initiate certain actions on such resources such as when a certain employee using a certain tablet seeks to email certain documents to certain recipients that are not affiliated with the respective enterprise. Compliance rules may be associated with such user devices users of user devices and or resources by an administrator of a compliance rule server as described herein.

Compliance rules may specify security requirements conditions and or events required for user device to perform certain functions on user device . In some embodiments compliance rules may specify certain methods and or steps of methods that must be performed before a user device is authorized to perform certain actions on certain resources accessible to certain user devices . In particular compliance rules may specify that certain resources must be associated and or united with certain watermark templates before certain user devices may be authorized to perform certain actions on certain resources accessible to such user devices as described herein. Additionally in certain embodiments compliance rules may specify that certain resources such as those associated with a request to share such resources may only be accessed and or transmitted by certain applications such as a containerized application capable of receiving and or rending the resources in a secure environment. Such an embodiment may be effectuated for instance by compliance rules specifying that such resource must be one and or more of encrypted associated with certain metadata and or associated with certain file extensions to restrict a user device from performing certain actions on the resources outside of a containerized application capable of interpreting such encryption metadata and or file extensions.

In some embodiments compliance rules may specify that user device must satisfy and or comply with a single condition for user device to be authorized to perform certain functions of user device associated with the compliance rules . For instance compliance rules may require that user device is associated with a current time that is within an authorized time period specified by such compliance rules in order for user device to be authorized to take certain actions on certain resources accessible to user device . More specifically compliance rules may specify that user device is authorized to share a business email resource such as by email while the system clock of user device is within a configured workday and user device is not authorized to access the business email resource while the system clock of user device is outside of the configured workday. In some embodiments compliance rules may specify that user device must satisfy and or comply with more than one condition for user device to be authorized to perform certain actions on resources accessible to user device . For example compliance rules may specify that user device must be associated with a safe zone location such as an enterprise office location to upload certain sensitive resources accessible to user device such as those affiliated with an enterprise which may require that both a GPS sensor of user device indicates that user device is currently located within the geographic boundaries of the safe zone and that a Wi Fi sensor of user device indicates that user device is communicatively coupled to a Wi Fi network access point associated with the safe zone.

In some embodiments compliance rules may specify that user device and another computing device such as another user device must both satisfy and or comply with one or more conditions for user device to be authorized to perform certain functions of user device associated with the compliance rules . Compliance rules may require that user device be located within proximity of and or be communicatively coupled to a secondary user device and that both user devices be located within an authorized location in order to perform certain actions on certain resources accessible to user device . As an example compliance rules may specify that user devices associated with nurses may only view resources associated with their patients such as a patient s medical records while the user devices associated with such nurses are located within 10 feet of user devices associated with such patients and while the user devices associated with nurses and user devices associated with patients are both located within examination rooms specific to such patients appointments.

In some embodiments compliance rules may be granular such that user device may be authorized to perform certain actions on certain resources depending on how many of the conditions of the compliance rules are satisfied by user device . For example user device may be authorized to access an enterprise contact resource on user device if a GPS sensor on user device indicates that user device is located within the enterprise s location but user device may be prohibited from sending an email with an enterprise resource attached until a watermark template associated with the enterprise resource is associated with and or affixed to the enterprise resource and until it is confirmed that user device is located within a safe zone by being communicatively coupled to a Wi Fi network access point associated with the enterprise.

An agent application agent app on user device may determine whether compliance rules are satisfied as described herein. For instance agent application may determine whether user device complies with certain compliance rules by determining whether device profile provides indications that user device complies with such compliance rules . As an example agent application may determine whether device profile specifies that the current time associated with user device is within a configured workday specified by compliance rules . Alternatively user device may transmit all and or a portion of device profile to a compliance server that may determine whether user device satisfies compliance rules as described herein. In any case user device may be authorized and or instructed to perform functions of user device such as performing certain actions on certain resources accessible to user device response to a determination that user device complies with compliance rules . In certain embodiments an agent application may authorize the device to perform such actions by calling the operating system of user device and or communicating with such operating system via an API and or SDK.

Furthermore embodiments of this disclosure may be practiced in conjunction with a graphics library other operating systems or any other application program and is not limited to any particular application or system. The devices described with respect to the Figures may have additional features or functionality. For example user device may also include additional data storage devices removable and or non removable such as for example magnetic disks optical disks or tape not shown .

In some embodiments the user device may be communicatively coupled to the resource server watermark template server and compliance server via the network . The network may include for instance a cellular network Wi Fi network Bluetooth network and or any other network capable of transmitting data between and or amongst user device resource server watermark template server and compliance server . While the resource server the watermark template server and the compliance server are represented as separate elements amongst operating environment it is understood that such servers could be combined into a single server capable of performing the same and or similar functionality that each of the resource server the watermark template server and the compliance server may be capable of performing separately such as executing a management system and or application.

In some embodiments the resource server may comprise a server that manages a plurality of resources such as resources associated with an enterprise. The resource server may include a resource store which may store such resources . The resource server may transmit resources to the user device and may receive transmissions of resources from the user device via the network . The resource server may be associated with the user device for instance by enrolling the user device into a management system and or application executed by resource server . More specifically resource server may distribute certain settings and or configuration profiles to the user device that enables resource server to instruct user device to perform certain actions such as instructing user device to download certain resources from resource store of resource server . The resource server may also track and or manage the usage of resources associated with the resource server such as by receiving and or logging event logs transmitted by user device describing the usage of the resources . The event logs may include and or describe usage of the resource by detailing for instance a device identifier associated with a user device a user identifier associated with a user of a user device a resource a watermark template associated with a resource an request to perform an action on a resource an action performed on a resource and or the like.
