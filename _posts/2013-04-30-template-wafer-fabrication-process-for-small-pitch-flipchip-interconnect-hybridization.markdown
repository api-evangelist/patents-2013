title: Template wafer fabrication process for small pitch flip-chip interconnect hybridization
abstract: A template wafer fabrication process is disclosed for high density indium bumping of microchips by using an innovative template wafer upon which the bumps are initially fabricated. Once fabricated, these bumps are transferred to the microchip, after which can be hybridized to another microchip. Such a template wafer is reusable, and thus provides an economical way to fabricate indium bumps. Reusability also eliminates nonuniformities in bump shape and size in serial processing of separate microchips, which is not the case for other indium bump fabrication processes. Such a fabrication process provides a way to form relatively tall indium bumps and accomplishes this without the standard thick photoresist liftoff process. The described process can be suitable for bump pitches under 10 microns, and is only limited by the resolution of the photolithography equipment used.

This is a second divisional patent application of copending first divisional patent application Ser. No. 13 414 781 filed Mar. 8 2012 entitled Template Wafer and Process for Small Pitch Flip Chip Interconnect Hybridization which arose from a parent application Ser. No. 12 571 812 issued on Apr. 24 2012 as U.S. Pat. No. 8 163 644 B2. The aforementioned applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used sold imported and or licensed by or for the United States Government.

The disclosure relates to a process for fabricating high density indium bumps based on a template wafer and transfer of these bumps to hybridize microchips.

Devices that contain microelectronic components generally require a transfer of information from the chip to one or several other components on the system. In many cases these other components are not monolithically fabricated on the same chip where they could be easily interconnected through a variety of techniques. Instead a highly conductive layer sandwiched between two components is required to transfer information. One of the industry standard ways to do this it by flip chip bump bonding. This technique requires the deposition of a soft conductive material to be deposited on either one or both of the microchips to be bonded. Once performed the two components are optically aligned in a piece of equipment called a hybrid bump bonder or hybridizer. After this alignment process the two chips are pressed together by the hybridizer. This pressure sometimes with the addition of heat causes a permanent bond of the two components due to adhesion of the soft conductive layer.

Like most things in the microelectronics industry the pitch of these flip chip interconnects has gotten smaller over time. This small pitch makes it increasingly difficult to hybridize two chips with a high yield of successful bonds. In some cases new technology has emerged that allows for small pitch interconnection through vastly different techniques. However for a variety of reasons these techniques are generally not suitable when bonding together chips that are composed of different substrate materials. One example of this is in the infrared sensing industry where the light sensing focal planar array composed of HgCdTe grown on CdZnTe is hybridized to a read out integrated circuit composed of Si. These devices are generally thermally cycled between room temperature when they turned off to 77 K during operation. A large difference in the thermal coefficient of expansion between CdZnTe and Si causes the two microchips to expand and contract differently over this temperature range. This places a requirement on the interconnects to be soft and relatively tall in order to conform to the stress caused by thermal cycling. Due to these requirements indium is the preferred interconnect material. As higher resolution focal planar arrays with smaller pixels are produced smaller pitch In interconnects will be required to transfer information to the read out integrated circuit. As this pitch falls below 10 m current technology will become less capable of successfully hybridizing the two microchips.

A process is disclosed for high density indium bumping of microchips by using an innovative template wafer upon which the bumps are initially fabricated. Once fabricated these bumps are transferred to the microchip after which can be hybridized to another microchip. This template wafer is reusable and thus provides an economical way to fabricate indium bumps. Reusability also eliminates nonuniformities in bump shape and size in serial processing of separate microchips which is not the case for other indium bump fabrication processes.

In one aspect a template wafer is disclosed for small pitch flip chip interconnect hybridization comprising a core Si wafer a Ni layer on a front side of said Si wafer an Al layer on said Ni layer on the front side a Ni layer on a backside of said Si wafer an Al layer on said Ni layer on the backside a nonconductive layer based on polytetrafluoroethylene up to a thickness of 20 microns as a top surface of said Al layer of said front side and a nonconductive layer based on polytetrafluoroethylene on a back surface of said Al layer of said backside. Surface features are formed into said nonconductive layer of said front side. Said surface features are either etched or recessed down to expose said Ni layer on said front side to yield conductive features capable of indium plating to form indium bumps upon electroplating.

In another aspect a template wafer fabrication process is disclosed comprising at least one of degreasing and removing an oxide surface of a core Si wafer depositing a Ni layer on a front side of said Si wafer based on evaporation or sputtering depositing an Al layer onto said Ni layer on the front side based on evaporation or sputtering depositing a Ni layer on a backside of said Si wafer based on evaporation or sputtering depositing an Al layer onto said Ni layer on the backside based on evaporation or sputtering depositing a nonconductive layer based on polytetrafluoroethylene up to a thickness of 20 microns to a top surface of said Al layer of said front side depositing a nonconductive layer based on polytetrafluoroethylene to a back surface of said Al layer of said backside applying a baking procedure to remove solvents and or smooth exposed surfaces upon depositing of at least one of said nonconductive layers and forming surface features on said front side to expose at least said nonconductive layer underneath. Said surface features are either etched or imprinted down to expose said Ni layer on said front side yielding conductive features capable of indium plating to form indium bumps upon electroplating. The evaporation can be either electron beam or heated evaporation and the sputtering can be either AC or DC sputtering.

The fabrication process described provides a way to form relatively tall indium bumps and accomplishes this without the standard thick photoresist liftoff process which makes it nearly impossible to fabricate relatively tall bumps with a pitch under 10 microns. The described process is suitable for bump pitches under 10 microns and is only limited by the resolution of the photolithography equipment used. Additionally this process is capable of producing relatively tall bumps with heights over 8 microns possible for 3 micron wide bumps at a 10 micron pitch. Such a large aspect ratio is important when hybridizing two microchips composed of different substrates that experience some thermal cycling. This is due to the need for the indium bumps to comply to strain caused by differences in the thermal coefficient of expansion of the two microchips.

An exemplary indium bump transfer process is outlined in . An exemplary template wafer as fabricated is shown in . Details of this process are discussed below. Such an exemplary template wafer is comprised of a conductive core layer and nonconductive layers deposited and defined upon both sides of it. The top nonconductive layer is based on polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE as indium does not stick well to it. The dimensions of this wafer can be at least as large as the dimensions of the area to be bumped on the microchip.

After the fabrication step the template wafer is placed in an electroplating setup . The electroplating setup includes a power supply that has the capability to run in a constant current mode. One such power supply is the Agilent 3616A. The positive terminal of the power supply is electrically connected to one terminal of an ammeter to monitor current being provided by the power supply. One may use the Fluke 8845A digital multimeter operating in ammeter mode. The other terminal of the ammeter is electrically connected to the anode . In an exemplary embodiment the anode is composed of high purity indium with a purity of 99.99 or better. One face of the anode has a surface area that is equal to or greater than that of the template wafer. The negative terminal of the power supply is electrically connected to the template wafer . The template wafer is thus the cathode of the electroplating setup. Both the anode and cathode are placed in an acryllic tank . The two electrodes are placed parallel to one another separated by 5 centimeters. The tank is filled with an indium electroplating solution so that the electrodes can be fully immersed. One can use the Indium Sulfamate electroplating solution provided by Indium Corporation of America. A sparging tube is also placed in the electroplating bath to improve mass transport by piping an inert gas such as Ar or N.

Once the electroplating setup is connected the power supply is turned on and current is raised to initiate indium plating. Initiation of plating is shown in occurring only in regions where the conductive layer is exposed. The current is roughly in direct proportion to deposition rate though current density should be kept between 108 and 216 A m where the area is the surface area of indium plating regions. shows completion of plating when the indium overgrows the nonconductive layer . This overgrowth should be on the order of 1 to 2 microns.

The plated template wafer shown in is now ready for removal of exposed indium oxide and transfer of indium to a microchip. shows the beginning of this process. The plated template wafer is placed on the vacuum chuck of a hybrid bump bonder capable of micron resolution alignment. One such piece of equipment is the Suss Microtec FC 150. The microchip after removal of oxide from the metallization pads is placed on the other vacuum chuck . The two wafers are aligned by the system so the indium lines up with the metallization pads of the microchip. Once aligned the hybrid bump bonder presses the two with or without heat resulting in a bond between the indium and metallization pads. Upon releasing the two the indium sticks to the metallization pads and releases from the template wafer as shown in . The release is possible due to the small surface area of indium at the conductive layer interface of the template wafer compared to that of the metallization pad interface of the microchip . This is also possible due to the low adhesion of indium to PTFE that allows it to easily transfer. The result is a set of indium bumps on the microchip .

The initial layers of an exemplary fabrication of the template wafer are shown in . In such an exemplary embodiment a Si wafer is the core of the template wafer. The Si wafer can be degreased by dipping in e.g. acetone methanol isopropyl alcohol and deionized water for two minutes. The oxide surface of the Si wafer can then be removed by dipping in a 2 HF in deionized water solution for 1 minute. A 1 micron Ni layer is deposited on the front side of this wafer. One can perform deposition by a variety of techniques including electron beam or heated evaporation or AC or DC sputtering. This Ni layer will serve as the plating base where indium growth is initiated during the electroplating process described above. A 200 nanometer Al layer is then deposited on the Ni layer by similar deposition techniques. Al is chosen because it sticks well to PTFE and will act as an adhesion layer. After deposition of these layers a 1 micron Ni layer followed by a 200 nanometer Al layer are deposited on the backside of the Si wafer by the same deposition techniques. The purpose of these layers is to balance stress on the Si wafer to keep it as flat as possible. The sum of these layers comprises the conductive layer of the transfer wafer .

In an exemplary embodiment the top side nonconductive layer is based on PTFE polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon AF 1601S with 18 solids provided by DuPont de Nemours Co. This layer is spun onto the conductive layer at spin speeds in the 3000 5000 rpm range. By diluting the Teflon 1691S in Fluorinert FC 770 provided by 3M the thickness of the nonconductive layer can be spun on as thick as 20 microns. The thickness of this layer is chosen to be roughly 1 to 2 microns less than the desired final height of the indium bumps. After spin on of the nonconductive layer a baking procedure is necessary to drive out solvents and allow for smoothing out of the surface. This procedure is as follows. The wafer is placed on a hotplate held at 112 C. for 15 minutes. The temperature is then ramped to 165 C. for 15 minutes. At this point all of the solvents are driven out of the nonconductive layer. Finally the wafer is held for 30 minutes at 335 C. on the hotplate to smoothen out the layer. Afterwards the wafer is allowed to cool. A backside nonconductive layer is spun onto the backside of the wafer by the same procedure as for the top side layer. The baking process is also the same except the 335 C. step is omitted as surface morphology of the backside is not critical. The purpose of this layer is to stop any deposition of indium onto the backside of the wafer during electroplating.

To produce e.g. 10 micron pitch bumps these features can have a 10 micron pitch and their individual size can be on the order of 2 4 microns. This photolithography step can be the limiting factor of the minimum bump size and pitch attainable for such an exemplary template fabrication procedure. Therefore higher resolution photolithography techniques should allow for bump sizes under 1 micron and pitches on the order of a couple of microns. The Al layer is then etched where exposed regions are etched exposing the nonconductive layer underneath. The etching can be performed either by chemical etching or plasma etching. One chemical etch that can be used is the PAN etch. This etch is comprised of phosphoric acid acetic acid nitric acid and de ionized water in a 16 1 1 2 ratio held at 40 C. shows the template wafer after etching of the Al etch mask layer and removal of the photoresist by acetone bath of photoresist stripper.

After definition of the etch mask the nonconductive layer is defined by a plasma etching step. Etching of PTFE including Teflon AF 1601S is achieved by a reactive ion etching process using a mixture of Ar and Ogases at several hundred eV. Obtaining proper sidewall angle is critical for good transfer of indium from the template wafer to the microchip as already discussed. The gas mixture should thus be tuned to obtain sidewall angles of roughly 70 degrees with respect to interface of the layers of the wafer.

Fabrication of the template wafer is completed by etching away the exposed Al under layer by a chemical etch or plasma etch. Once again the PAN etch described above could be used to for this purpose. shows the finished template wafer where exposed Ni will serve as the plating base upon which indium growth will begin during electroplating.

Another exemplary embodiment follows . The following steps occur in the same manner as the initial exemplary embodiment degreasing and oxide etching dip of the Si wafer about 500 nanometer to 1 micron topside Ni deposition and 200 nanometer Al deposition and backside about 500 nanometer to 1 micron Ni deposition and 200 nanometer Al deposition. This exemplary embodiment uses a different set of techniques to deposit the topside nonconductive layer and backside nonconductive layer of . Instead of using spin on Teflon AF 1601 S to deposit these layers PTFE can be deposited in a vacuum chamber onto the conductive layer of the transfer wafer shown in . One can use either RF sputtering deposition or atomic layer deposition ALD to perform deposition of PTFE. The thickness of the deposition of the topside nonconductive layer can be chosen to be roughly 1 to 2 microns less than the desired final height of the indium bumps. The thickness of the deposition of the backside nonconductive layer can be chosen to be about 1 micron. This thickness is not critical and only serves to cover the backside of the wafer to stop any deposition of indium onto the backside of the wafer during electroplating. No baking steps are required after deposition.

After deposition of the PTFE nonconductive layers fabrication proceeds as in the initial exemplary embodiment. This includes deposition patterning and etching of the 200 nanometer thick Al etch mask plasma etching of the topside nonconductive layer removal of the 200 nanometer thick Al etch mask and etching of the exposed 200 nanometer thick Al under layer.

Yet another exemplary embodiment follows . The following steps occur in the same manner as the initial exemplary embodiment degreasing and oxide etching dip of the Si wafer about 500 nanometer to 1 micron topside Ni deposition and 200 nanometer Al deposition backside about 500 nanometer to 1 micron Ni deposition and 200 nanometer Al deposition deposition of the topside nonconductive layer by either of the techniques described in the previous exemplary embodiments and deposition of the backside nonconductive layer by either of the techniques described in the previous exemplary embodiments.

After definition of the etch mask the nonconductive layer is defined by a plasma etching step using the same techniques as the described in the initial exemplary embodiment. The etching proceeds until roughly half of the thickness of the exposed nonconductive layer is exposed to form the isolation notches. shows the template wafer after the nonconductive layer etching process to define isolation notches and removal of the Al layer by a chemical etch previously described.

After etching of the Al etch mask fabrication proceeds as in the initial embodiment. This includes plasma etching of the topside nonconductive layer removal of the 200 nanometer thick Al etch mask and etching of the exposed 200 nanometer thick Al under layer . The completed template wafer is shown in

Yet another exemplary embodiment follows . The following steps occur in the same manner as the initial embodiment degreasing and oxide etching dip of the Si wafer about 500 nanometer to 1 micron topside Ni deposition and 200 nanometer Al deposition backside about 500 nanometer to 1 micron Ni deposition and 200 nanometer Al deposition deposition of the topside nonconductive layer by either of the techniques described in the previous embodiments and deposition of the backside nonconductive layer by either of the techniques described in the previous embodiments.

This exemplary embodiment differs from previous ones in the way that the features on the topside nonconductive layer are defined. Rather than using an etch mask followed by etching this exemplary embodiment involves imprinting the topside nonconductive layer with features defined on another wafer to be called the imprinting wafer. The result is that the features on the nonconductive layer will be a negative of the features defined on the imprinting wafer. The procedure for this process is described below.

As shown in fabrication of such an exemplary imprinting wafer begins with a Si wafer of the same dimensions as the Si wafer used as the core of the template wafer. A standard photolithography step is performed to define features in the photoresist layer . In the end these features will be used to etch into the silicon wafer and then imprinted into the nonconductive layer to form the mesas shown in . The dimension of these features will depend on the pitch and size of bumps required. If a 10 micron bump pitch is desired with 3 micron bumps these features will be roughly 7 microns because these features are the negative of the features imprinted in the nonconductive layer.

After completing the fabrication of the imprinting wafer the imprinting step follows shown in . The incomplete template wafer consisting of a conductive layer an undefined topside nonconductive layer and a nonconductive backside layer is placed on the vacuum chuck of a hybrid bump bonder capable of micron resolution alignment. One such piece of equipment is the Suss Microtec FC 150. The imprinting wafer is placed on the other vacuum chuck . The two wafers are roughly aligned and heated past the glass transition temperature of the nonconductive layer. If this layer was formed using the first embodiment using Teflon AF 1601S this temperature is 160 C. If this layer was formed using the second embodiment this temperature will depend on the specific PTFE used. After heating the two wafers are pressed together held for several minutes allowed to cool back to room temperature and finally separated from one another. The result is an exemplary completed template wafer shown in

Using this process it is possible to form the isolation notches fabricated in the third embodiment. This requires an extra photolithography and etching step in the imprinting wafer to form negatives of the notches.

The invention has been described in an illustrative manner. It is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than limitation. Many modifications and variations of the invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Therefore within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described.
