The present invention relates generally to generating aerosols at very low liquid and gas feed rates.

Inhalation research often requires working with highly toxic and or expensive compounds. These compounds are typically in a liquid form and must be converted to an aerosol in a respirable range for the purposes of conducting experiments. It is imperative that the aerosols have a consistent particle size and concentration and that they are reproducible during numerous experiments over a period of time.

An additional requirement of inhalation research is that the compounds must be used undiluted neat to eliminate an effect caused by solvents. Since the compounds are often expensive and or highly toxic it is essential to use the minimal amount necessary for safety and cost effectiveness. Further research with compounds that are often highly toxic requires the use of a glove box or double containment device which imposes size constraints on the size of the equipment. In particular small volume chambers for the exposures are required and therefore a low gas flow generator is needed.

Prior art syringe drives and syringes used with conventional fittings and feed lines in an annular atomizer tend to experience pulsing spitting and sputtering especially at the ultra low flow rates. This is due to the surface tension of the dispensed fluid breaking at the point of generation in normal inner diameter feed lines. Prior art systems also experience an oscillation in output due to the earn action of syringe drive feed systems.

Thus a need exists for a micro atomizing system capable of functioning efficiently at ultra low liquid and low gas feed rates.

The invention in one embodiment encompasses an atomizing system with reduced dead space provided by a very small diameter fluid compound feed line and a containment system for using the atomizing system to perform inhalation research. In one embodiment the atomizing system includes 

a tee fitting having a main bore and as secondary bore perpendicular to the main bore the secondary bore coupled to as compressed gas source at as pressure of approximately 30 60 psi 

a tube extending through the main bore of the tee fitting wherein a first end of the tube adjacent to a first end of the main bore of the tee fitting is attached to a syringe and is capable of receiving a fluid compound from the syringe at a feed rate of 0.2 20 l min and

a needle attached to a second end of the main bore of the tee fitting the needle receiving compressed gas from the secondary bore and the main bore of the tee fitting 

wherein the tube extends through the tee fitting and the needle so that a second end of the tube extends slightly beyond the needle and fluid is injected from the end of the tube into the compressed gas flow from the annular opening between the tube and the needle.

a tee fitting haying a main bore and a secondary bore perpendicular to the main bore the secondary bore coupled to a compressed gas source 

a 32 gauge tube extending through the main bore of the tee fitting wherein a first end of the 32 gauge tube adjacent to a first end of the main bore of the tee fitting is attached to a syringe and is capable of receiving a fluid compound from the syringe and

a 22 gauge needle attached to a second end of the main bore of the tee fitting the 22 gauge needle receiving compressed air from the secondary bore and the main bore of the tee fitting 

wherein the 32 gauge tube extends through the tee fitting and the 22 gauge needle so that a second end of the 32 gauge tube extends slightly beyond the 22 gauge needle and fluid is injected from the end of the 32 gauge tube into the compressed gas flow from the annular opening between the 32 gauge tube and the 22 gauge needle

In another embodiment a system for performing inhalation research includes at atomizing system for generating an aerosol and equipment for performing tests on the aerosol both inside a glove box containment system

Turning to . an apparatus in one example comprises the atomizing system of the present invention. Atomizing system receives a continuous flow of a compound or agent to be atomized from syringe drive for example a Harvard Apparatus Model 22 Syringe Pump. Atomizing system also receives pressurized gas from gas feed .

An aerosol generated by atomizing system enters carrier system for example stainless steel tubing. This system may optionally include other components that further modify properties of the aerosol generated by the atomizing system for example a spraying cylinder a drying cylinder a bleed off valve a cyclone and additional air inputs.

From carrier system the aerosol enters manifold system . Air inlets not shown ensure that the aerosol is evenly distributed. Finally sampling system contains equipment used in testing the aerosol for example aerosol monitors particle counters filters cascade impactors etc.

To accomplish inhalation research on highly toxic compounds in a safe manner the aerosol must he double contained. Each of the systems of is a closed system and then the entire apparatus is enclosed within a glove box . The exhaust from apparatus is captured and processed through carbon filters or other purifying devices as well.

The use of a double containment system including glove box for experiments in inhalation research imposes size constraints on systems . For example small volume chambers are required and therefore a low gas flow generator for example 1.4 2.4 l min is needed. It is also paramount to use neat compounds to generate the aerosol to eliminate an effects caused by solvents. Because of the toxicity and cost associated with certain compounds it is also beneficial to use the smallest volume of agent needed to conduct an experiment.

In one embodiment of the present invention an atomizing system which meets the requirements of both low quantities of compound and low gas flow is shown in more detail in . In this atomizing system dead space is virtually non existent at approximately 2.8 l foot of liquid feed line which dispenses directly into the gas stream for atomization. With no need for passivation and the ability to control feed rates the inventive atomizing system is reliable efficient and effective. The gas reaches critical velocity at the point of generation at less than 2 l min. With a gas flow this low the atomizing system can be used with a very small chamber and still produce a reliable aerosol for inhalation research.

As shown in atomizing system is connected to a source of compressed gas by fitting . The compressed gas may be of any composition. In a preferred embodiment a high efficiency particulate air HEPA filter will be used in line. This HEPA filter will reduce the likelihood of clogging in the annular opening between tubing and needle . The pressure 30 60 psi or flow 1.4 2.4 l min is controlled with a regulator or mass flow controller respectively. In a preferred embodiment fitting would be a 1 16 Swagelok reducer but any suitable fitting may be used. The compressed gas enters a tee fitting for example a 1 16 Swagelok chromatograph union tee. Tee fitting has perpendicular bores and . A short length of stainless steel tubing is used to provide a surface for ferrule to tighten against so that air flow in through bore may be maintained. In a preferred embodiment these bores are 0.05 diameter.

A removable needle RN type syringe containing as fluid compound to be atomized is coupled to the atomizing system by adapter subject of a co pending application. The syringe for example a Hamilton 1700 series gas tight RN syringe is loaded with a desired compound and placed in a syringe drive for example Harvard Apparatus model 22 syringe pump and connected to adapter . The syringe diameter is entered into the syringe drive and feed rate is set to a value in the range of approximately 0.2 l min to 20 l min in to preferred embodiment.

To provide very low dead space in the system and therefore use small amounts of compound fluid from the syringe is transferred down the length of the atomizing system to the point of atomization by tubing having a very small diameter for example 32 gauge stainless steel hypodermic tubing. To fortify and seal tubing it is sheathed in polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE tubing . In a preferred embodiment tubing has an outer diameter of 0.0625 and an inner diameter of 0.01 .

Adapter is securely attached to tubing sheathed in tubing by means of a union fitting for example a 1 16 Swagelok chromatograph union. To provide sufficient diameter for tubing and union fitting is bored out to 0.07 . Ferrules within union fitting create to tight seal between tithing tubing and union fitting and hold all components securely in place.

Tee fitting has a proximal end and a distal end . Within proximal end a proximal shoulder provides a stop for PTFE tubing while 32 gauge tubing passes through tee fitting . FIFE tubing also prevents air from bore from leaking back towards adapter . End fitting is used in conjunction with a ferrule to securely attach the proximal end to tubing and .

In distal end of tee fitting a short length of stainless steel tubing is used to provide a surface for ferrule to tighten against so that air flow in through bore may be maintained.

A stainless steel needle having a blunt tip and a base is attached to the distal end of tee fitting by means of a liter lock titling . In a preferred embodiment luer lock fitting is a Popper Sons stainless steel male liter lock to 10 32 standard thread. The threaded end of luer lock fitting engages ferrule to provide a secure connection to stainless steel tubing section .

The 32 gauge stainless steel tubing extends coaxially through bore liter lock fitting and needle To prevent sputtering at the tip tubing extends beyond needle by approximately 0.03125 .

An illustrative description of operation of the atomizing system is presented for explanatory purposes. Compressed gas is attached to and the pressure or flow for a given experiment is set using a regulator or mass flow controller. The compressed gas travels through fitting tee fitting luer lock fitting and needle to exit the atomizing system at . A syringe nut shown is loaded with at fluid component to be tested then attached to atomizing system via adapter . The syringe is then placed into a syringe drive. The syringe drive s diameter and feed rate are set and the syringe drive is turned on thereby forcing the fluid in the syringe through adapter and tubing . When the fluid reaches the end of tubing it is injected into the gas flow from the annular opening and the liquid is atomized.

Numerous alternative implementations of the present invention exist. For example different sized fittings could be used as long as they are adapted to securely hold a 32 gauge needle for transferring liquid from the syringe to the end of the atomizing system.
