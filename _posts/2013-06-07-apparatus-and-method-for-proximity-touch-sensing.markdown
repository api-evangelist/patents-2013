Referring to a proximity touch sensing apparatus includes the electrostatic capacity touch panel the shield layer and the proximity touch controller .

The electrostatic capacity touch panel includes x electrode lines deployed to extend in a first direction and spaced equidistantly from each other and y electrode lines electrically insulated from the x electrode lines and with the y electrode lines deployed to extend in a second direction and spaced equidistantly from each other with the first and second directions being perpendicular or substantially perpendicular. The x electrode lines may be labeled as st nd etc. to end representing the first second intermediate and last x electrode lines respectively. Similarly the y electrode lines may be labeled as st nd etc. to end representing the first second intermediate and last y electrode lines respectively.

The shield layer is disposed in a predetermined direction such as a vertical direction at a specific distance from the electrostatic capacity touch panel for example below the electrostatic capacity touch panel . According to the present invention the shield layer is a noise shielding ground or an electrode which forms a capacitance for sensing a non contact touch.

The proximity touch controller is electrically connected to the electrostatic capacity touch panel and the shield layer and can control the following two operations for proximity touch sensing.

First the proximity touch controller generates a capacitance for contact touch sensing by using the electrostatic capacity touch panel . The proximity touch controller configures the x electrode lines of the proximity touch controller as the Transmit Tx channel configures the y electrode lines as the Receive Rx channel and forms a capacitance by supplying a voltage to the Tx channel and the Rx channel. In this case if a conductor e.g. a finger is in contact with the electrostatic capacity touch panel the proximity touch controller generates and transmits a signal representing a contact touch to the host unit .

Second the proximity touch controller generates a capacitance for non contact touch sensing by using the electrostatic capacity touch panel and the shield layer . The proximity touch controller changes the shield layer from a noise shielding ground to be a Tx channel to be an electric field generating electrode and configures at least one electrode line of the electrostatic capacity touch panel to be an Rx channel. In addition the proximity touch controller forms a capacitance by supplying a voltage to the Tx channel and the Rx channel. In this case if there is a non contact touch in which a conductor is brought within a predetermined threshold distance of the electrostatic capacity touch panel the proximity touch controller generates and transmits a signal representing a non contact touch to the host unit .

Accordingly as a user brings a finger or other conducting member into proximity with the touch screen device or unit the present invention senses a varying in the capacitance as a variable quantity and generates and transmits a corresponding electrical signal to the host unit representing a detected proximity of the finger or member near the touch screen device or unit .

Referring to in step the proximity touch controller configures at least one of the x electrode lines and the y electrode lines of the electrostatic capacity touch panel as an Rx channel.

In step the proximity touch controller changes the shield layer from a noise shielding ground to a Tx channel.

In step the proximity touch controller forms a first capacitance by supplying a voltage to the Tx channel and the Rx channel to sense a non contact touch.

If a variable quantity of the first capacitance is greater than or equal to a first threshold and is less than a second threshold in step the method proceeds to step and the proximity touch controller generates and transmits a signal representing a non contact touch to the host unit . Otherwise if the condition of step is not satisfied the proximity touch controller loops back to step and performs the step and its subsequent steps.

After step if the variable quantity of the first capacitance is greater than or equal to the second threshold in step the method proceeds to step in which the proximity touch controller configures the x electrode lines of the electrostatic capacity touch panel as a Tx channel and configures the y electrode lines as an Rx channel. Otherwise if the condition of step is not satisfied the proximity touch controller loops back to step and performs the step and its subsequent steps.

After step the method performs step in which the proximity touch controller changes the shield layer from a Tx channel to a noise shielding ground.

In step to sense a contact touch a second capacitance is formed by supplying a voltage to the Tx channel and the Rx channel.

In step if the variable quantity of the second capacitance is greater than or equal to a third threshold the method proceeds to step in which the proximity touch controller generates and transmits a signal representing a contact touch to the host unit and the method of then ends. However in step if the condition of step is not satisfied the proximity touch controller loops back to step and performs the step and its subsequent steps.

Referring to in step the host unit receives a signal representing a non contact touch from the proximity touch controller .

In step the present invention determines whether the host unit is configured to allow the execution of a function for a non contact touch. For example a user may predetermine and set the terminal not to execute the function for the non contact touch or alternatively may predetermine and set the terminal to execute the function for the non contact touch.

If it is determined in step to allow the execution of the function for the non contact touch the method proceeds to step and the host unit executes the function for the non contact touch. The method of then ends.

Otherwise if it is determined in step not to allow the execution of the function for the non contact touch the host unit does not execute the function for the non contact touch so the method skips step and then the method of ends.

The procedure of is related to processing of a signal generated in the process of performing the present invention in particular step of for a change from the configuration of sensing the non contact touch to the configuration of sensing the contact touch of the exemplary embodiment of FIG. .

In addition if a signal representing the contact touch is received from the proximity touch controller the host unit executes a corresponding function for the contact touch in a manner known in the art for processing touch events on the touch screen device or unit .

Referring to the proximity touch sensing unit according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention configures the electrostatic capacity touch panel as an Rx channel and configures the shield layer disposed below the electrostatic capacity touch panel spaced a specific predetermined distance D from the electrostatic capacity touch panel as a Tx channel. When a voltage is supplied to the Tx channel and the Rx channel the electric field for sensing a non contact touch is formed so that a user moving a hand finger or other member into the electric field changes the capacitance and so is detected by the proximity touch controller which generates and transmits a corresponding electric signal to the host unit in a manner known in the art for touch screens.

A capacitance i.e. electrostatic capacity shown in is a projected capacitance represents energy related to the electric field . The greater the capacitance the more advantageous the non contact touch sensing. However the following aspects are preferably considered for optimal non contact touch sensing.

The capacitance is in proportion to a permittivity and an electrode area and is in inverse proportion to a distance between two electrodes. Therefore the number of electrode lines used to constitute the Rx channel in the electrostatic capacity touch panel and specific positions of electrode lines to be selected are used as values for determining the capacitance. In addition since the shield layer which typically has a relatively wider area than that of an electrode of a typical touch panel is configured as a Tx channel in the present invention the capacitance can be increased. Further a distance D between the electrostatic capacity touch panel and the shield layer is used as a value for determining the capacitance. The smaller the distance D is the higher the capacitance is. Meanwhile although the capacitance is decreased when the distance D between the electrostatic capacity touch panel and the shield layer is increased since a variable quantity of the capacitance is small in regards to detecting proximity of a conductor the variable quantity can be considered when determining sensitive non contact touch sensing. That is since relatively small changes in the capacitance may be detected using the present invention relative spacing and sizing of components may be reduced without significant loss of detectable changes in the capacitance.

Referring to if a hand finger or other member of a user is brought to within a specific distance from the electrostatic capacity touch panel a variable quantity of a first capacitance is reduced and reaches and drops below a first threshold F and the proximity touch controller generates and transmits a signal representing a non contact touch to the host unit .

In addition referring to if the hand is brought closer to the electrostatic capacity touch panel the variable quantity of the first capacitance is reduced and reaches and drops below a second threshold F and the proximity touch controller changes the shield layer from an electric field generating electrode to a noise shielding ground so that if the hand finger or other member is brought into contact with the electrostatic capacity touch panel the present invention senses a contact touch by generating an electric field by using only the electrostatic capacity touch panel .

If an electric field is generated by using the electrostatic capacity touch panel and the shield layer as shown in and a variable quantity of a first capacitance is reduced by the presence of a conducting member such as a finger and the variable quantity reaches a second threshold F as shown in the proximity touch controller generates an electric field by using x electrodes and y electrodes of the electrostatic capacity touch panel as shown in and changes the shield layer from an electric field forming electrode to a noise shielding ground as shown in .

If a hand finger or other member of the user is then brought to contact the electrostatic capacity touch panel as shown in a variable quantity of a second capacitance of the electrostatic capacity touch panel is greater than or equal to a third threshold F and the proximity touch controller generates and transmits a signal representing the contact touch to the host unit .

It is understood that the switching between non contact touch sensing and contact touch sensing is reversible so that as the user moves a hand finger or other conducting member off of and away from the electrostatic capacity touch panel the proximity touch controller senses changes in the variable quantities of the first and second capacitances being below or above the appropriate thresholds F F F to change the terminal and or its touch screen device or unit from contact touch sensing to non contact touch sensing depending on the distance of the hand or other member from the surface of the electrostatic capacity touch panel .

In the present invention when an Rx channel for forming an electric field is determined in association with the shield layer configured as a Tx channel at least one electrode line of the electrostatic capacity touch panel is selectively determined to form an optimal electrode line for non contact touch sensing.

In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention of a first x electrode st a last x electrode line end a first y electrode line st and a last y electrode line end are selected to be an Rx channel deployed to an outermost part of the electrostatic capacity touch panel with the electrode lines st end st and end depicted with additional shading in to illustrate the Rx channel in the outermost part of the electrostatic capacity touch panel .

In conclusion a proximity touch sensing apparatus and method according to the present invention implement a touch area of an electrostatic capacity touch panel as an area for non contact touch sensing without being limited to simple proximity determination. Therefore various proximity gestures e.g. a palm recognition a finger swiper etc. can be detected.

In addition the present invention configures an electrostatic capacity touch panel and a shield layer for noise shielding of a display as an apparatus for generating an electric field. Therefore electrode lines of the electrostatic capacity touch panel can be selectively used and a distance between the electrostatic capacity touch panel and the shield layer can be regulated to generate an electric field for optimal non contact touch sensing using projected capacitance.

Furthermore the present invention uses a shield layer for noise shielding of a pre configured display as an apparatus for generating an electric field for non contact touch sensing which leads to cost reduction in fabricating the terminal .

In addition the present invention can mutually change between contact touch sensing and non contact touch sensing by using a touch screen thereby increasing usability of the touch screen.
