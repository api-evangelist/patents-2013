This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 767 956 filed Feb. 22 2013 U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 810 269 filed Apr. 10 2013 and U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 826 348 filed May 22 2013 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

A wide variety of circumstances result in inadequate access to healthcare for many individuals and families. Some lack adequate access because they live in isolated rural or other governmentally designated underserved areas. Some lack adequate access because they are uninsured or underinsured. Others live in developing countries where medical training and infrastructure is yet to be developed. Circumstances render some individuals without adequate access to healthcare in natural and manmade disaster areas and battlefields.

Moreover the cost of providing adequate healthcare is rising. While more money is spent on health care per person in the U.S. than in any other nation in the world in 2009 the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 16.7 of the population was uninsured. Current estimates put U.S. health care spending at approximately 16 of GDP. Growth in healthcare spending is projected to average 6.7 annually over the period 2007 through 2017. High healthcare costs also affect individuals. A 2007 study found that 62.1 of filers for bankruptcy cited high medical expenses as a contributing factor.

The following illustrative example is representative of an embodiment of the devices systems software and methods described herein and are not meant to be limiting in any way.

A 25 year old female subject living in Texas is experiencing symptoms associated with X. The nearest medical facility is at least a few hundred miles away. Previously the female was seen by her primary care physician who identified based on a risk profile analysis the statistical likelihood of the patient experiencing symptoms associated with X in the near future. Upon the occurrence of the symptoms the female using a networked device connects to a live remote adjunct provider. The provider a physician assistant PA located in California is credentialed by the researcher s healthcare provider who verified the PA s education training certifications references prescription license malpractice insurance coverage and state license and state of licensure. The PA asks basic questions about the subject s symptoms and examines the subject visually. To gather additional information the PA instructs the subject to use the biometric sensor equipped in her networked device. The biometric sensor measures the subject s vital signs and other biometric data such as her body temperature heart rate blood pressure and respiratory rate. The PA obtains the subject s consent to access her electronic health records. Using a software program which is updated regularly to meet applicable legal requirements the PA accesses the subject s medical history medication history family history and other relevant information. Based on the information gathered by the PA the subject is instructed to connect her medical therapy device and the apparatus for dispensing the pre prescribed medicaments for X to the networked device. The apparatus is confirmed visually as containing the pre prescribed medications for X and remotely unlocked by the PA.
