This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 969 282 filed on Dec. 15 2010 entitled Location Reporting Responsive to Transitions in Motional State of Wireless Equipment . The entirety of the foregoing application is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates to telecommunication and more particularly to location reporting based on motional conditions of wireless equipment.

Implementation of procedures for reporting location of mobile devices generally incurs a substantial amount of signaling in a wireless network and in the mobile device. Reporting location of a mobile device generally includes location area update at a wireless network that serves the mobile device. While idle the mobile device scans for a change in location area broadcast by a cell site in which the mobile device is camping on. In such scenario the change in location area causes the mobile device to transmit a location area update towards the wireless network through a first cell site detected by the mobile device. Updated location area information generally is utilized to route incoming pages towards a correct set of cell sites within the location area reported by the mobile device in response to the foregoing change. Yet location area updates typically are concentrated on border cell sites which are likely overloaded with signaling traffic. In addition location area updates also affect battery life of the mobile device.

Location areas may contain several e.g. 10 10 cell sites. Yet within such location areas there is no update or network knowledge of the actual location of the mobile device. Moreover in certain buildings mobile devices routinely select between disparate location areas and transmit related location area updates to several cell sites even when the mobile devices are stationary within the buildings. Such reselection and updates and related signaling load is exacerbated by load triggered cell breathing wherein the wireless network that serves a mobile device effectively moves with respect the mobile device even though the mobile device may be in a static state.

Moreover location areas generally are added in response to increases in network traffic and capacity demand in a wireless network increase the added location areas commonly cover less area that extant location area and thus cause an increase in location area updates. As a result signaling load and behavior is more dependent on the density of location area and mobility of a mobile device and less dependent on actual revenue creating activity of an end user. In such scenarios the accuracy value and benefit of location area updates based on changes in location area are less than the incremental signaling load. In certain scenarios a location area may have been enlarged to encompass several radio network controllers RNCs in order to reduce the number of disparate location areas and related updates caused by changes in location area. Yet such location area configuration can exacerbate paging signaling load rather than reduce location area update signaling load. In addition such location area configuration reduces the granularity or resolution of location awareness of the mobile device which can be useful for other applications or services.

Furthermore reporting location of a mobile device generally includes delivery of a location or related information by the mobile device. Mobile devices typically have background applications that are executed to measure and report location towards a server in a wireless network on a regular basis. In certain scenarios the mobile device can measure and report location nearly constantly or constantly. Such measuring and reporting consume battery resources and network resources available to the mobile device in order to collect and transmit the location or the related information. However such location or related information not always is current or necessary for operation of the mobile device. In addition reporting location of the mobile device from the mobile device generally is not utilized for call session routing thus any additional signaling load incurred by reporting location of the mobile device there from is in addition to signaling incurred for reporting location area changes. To mitigate the signaling overhead arising from such additional signaling certain mobile device may be configures to report location in response primarily to a change in cell site Wi Fi SSID or the like. Yet while such approach may reduce the signaling overhead and overall signaling load in a wireless network timeliness and accuracy of location reporting in mobile devices so configured can be reduced.

The following presents a simplified summary of the subject disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof. This summary is not an extensive overview of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure.

One or more embodiments of the subject disclosure provide system s and method s that enable reporting of location of wireless equipment based at least on transition amongst motional states of the wireless equipment. Various data and metrics are employed for detection of at least one movement condition of wireless equipment to identify changes in a mobility profile thereof. One or more changes in the mobility profile can convey a change in motional state of the wireless equipment analysis of the data and metrics enables determination of such change. While idle the wireless equipment can monitor its mobility profile to identify changes in the motional state of the wireless equipment. Identification of certain changes in the motional state of the wireless equipment enable the wireless equipment to measure report and update location thereof. In an aspect reporting of location of the wireless equipment includes location area reporting to a mobility switching center MSC for updating a network repository e.g. visited location register VLR and for voice call delivery. In another aspect location reporting of the wireless equipment includes delivery of a current or nearly current location of the wireless equipment to a SGSN or mobility management entity MME for packet data delivery. In yet another aspect location reporting of the wireless equipment includes delivery of location of the wireless equipment to a server that provides location based services.

Compared to conventional telecommunication technologies the subject disclosure provides various advantages. 1 For example signaling associated with location update activity of a mobile device is reduced with respect to conventional telecommunication technologies. 2 For another example current e.g. real time or nearly current location information becomes available for mobile device in quasi static state or static state. 3 For yet another example since different mobile devices generally transition from a dynamic state into a quasi static state or static state at different locations under different cell sites or sector sites impact on signaling load related to location reporting described herein is well distributed throughout a location area rather than being primarily localized at the border of the location area.

Explicit distinction between indoor serving AP and outdoor serving base station is made when context may be insufficient to distinguish the utilized terms.

Furthermore the terms user subscriber customer consumer and the like are employed interchangeably throughout the subject specification unless context warrants particular distinction s among the terms.

In addition the various illustrative scenarios and related examples are intended to be non limiting without restricting the applicability or utility of the various embodiments of systems and methods described herein or any modification or variations thereof.

As discussed in greater detail below various data and metrics are employed for detection of at least one movement condition of wireless equipment to identify changes in a mobility profile thereof. A change in the mobility profile can convey a change in motional state of the wireless equipment analysis of the data and metrics enables determination of such change. While idle the wireless equipment can monitor its mobility profile to identify changes in the motional state of the wireless equipment. Identification of certain changes in the motional state of the wireless equipment enable the wireless equipment to measure report and update location thereof at the network platform of a network operator that provides wireless service to the wireless equipment. A reported location of the wireless equipment e.g. a mobile device can be exploited for several location based services.

With respect to the drawings represents an example scenario that illustrates various principles of the subject disclosure. The example scenario illustrates a trajectory of a mobile device that relocates from an initial position R represented with an open star in to a final position R represented with a solid star in . Initial velocity at initial position Rand final velocity at final position Rare both nearly zero or zero whereas velocity at various positions within the trajectory can vary from zero to disparate finite values consistent with road conditions such as speed limit vehicular traffic density e.g. traffic jam traffic singularities e.g. roadblocks accidents etc. weather conditions and so forth. The trajectory in the subject example scenario involves five areas identified with five disparate location area codes LACs LAC I LAC II LAC III LAC IV and LAC V a wireless network not shown that serves the mobile device identifies assigns the five LACs according to specific identification protocol s . In addition the illustrated trajectory includes four boundary crossings B B B and B represented with solid circles in . It should be appreciated that other trajectories can have a disparate number of boundary crossings even in scenarios in the number of areas is maintained at five for instance trajectories with re entry points have a larger number of crossing points. Further to and scenario it is to be appreciated and understood that same or similar boundary crossings associated with LACs can occur for example in relation to buildings e.g. high rise buildings or other environments where two or more LAC boundaries are present.

Each of the five areas represents a cell site a sector site or a non macrocell coverage area e.g. a picocell a femtocell a microcell Wi Fi spot . . . . Accordingly in conventional telecommunication systems and related radio technology protocols mobile device performs a location update procedure such as location area update LAU in 3GPP UMTS radio technology upon or substantially upon reaching a boundary crossing B with 1 2 3 4. The location update procedure can include monitoring network pilot signal e.g. generated through a macrocell base station while in the idle mode wherein the network pilot signal includes a network location identifier ID such as LAC and or RAC in 3GPP UMTS. As mobile device effects the illustrated trajectory and thus moves between disparate network pilots e.g. moves within a macrocell sector associated with LAC II and reaches vicinity of a macrocell sector associated with LAC III the mobile device probes for a change in the network location ID e.g. LAC or RAC. When mobile device reaches a crossing point Bk or vicinity thereof mobile device detects a change in the network location ID e.g. LAC or RAC and performs the location update procedure e.g. LAU or RAU in order for a wireless network that serves the mobile device to become aware of the mobile device location for the wireless network to route incoming call pages properly. Yet as illustrated mobile device is in transit when located in areas and therefore likelihood of an incoming call session being effected while mobile device occupies such areas is significantly smaller than the likelihood of an incoming call session being effected while the device is at area or area . Therefore battery consumption associated with signaling exchange with the wireless network that is part of performance of the location update procedure e.g. LAU at boundary crossings B represents inefficient consumption of battery resources and wireless network resources available to the mobile device .

In contrast in the subject disclosure location updates and related procedures are performed in response to changes in motional state rather than at boundary crossings. In an aspect as mobile device departs the initial position Ri a transition from a quasi static state or static state to a dynamic state is identified and in response location update procedures are halted until the a transition from the dynamic state to quasi static state or static state is identified after the mobile device reaches final position . In a situation in which an incoming call session is directed to the mobile device while it is located in an area different from the area associated with the initial position the wireless network via a network node e.g. mobility switching center MSC therein can exploit flood paging to deliver incoming pages for the mobile device . In the quasi static state or static state associated with arrival at final position the mobile device performs location update with the wireless network to indicate current LAC e.g. LAC V for example. Implementation of location update procedure s based on transition on motional state of the mobile device reduces signaling and thus mitigates or avoids inefficient battery consumption.

The subject disclosure exploits transitions amongst motional states of wireless equipment e.g. mobile device to effect location reporting in general without restriction to location updates in the wireless network that serves the wireless equipment. In addition to location update e.g. LAU in 3GPP UMTS the location reporting that is responsive to transitions amongst motional states includes reporting location of the wireless equipment to SGSN or MME for packet data delivery and reporting location of the wireless equipment towards a server that provides location based services.

Example system includes a collection component that accesses e.g. receives retrieves or otherwise acquires data related to a mobility condition or a motional state of the wireless equipment. In an embodiment collection component can receive such data from at least one sensor of a group of one or more sensor s . The least one sensor of a set of one or more sensor s can generate the data related to the motional state of the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device and the at least one sensor can supply such data to collection component . In an alternative or additional embodiment the collection component can retrieve e.g. locate and gather such data from a memory or a memory element database register s file s etc. therein such as data storage . The at least one sensor also can supply the data to memory or a memory element therein such as data storage . The data related to the mobility condition of the wireless equipment e.g. a mobile device supplied by the group of one or more sensor s can reveal values of dynamic variables such as time position velocity acceleration which can provide information related to the at least one movement condition. The data can be collected through various types of measurements including 1 Doppler shift which can convey rather accurately the velocity of wireless equipment in wireless environments that exploit narrow band frequency channels 2 GNNS time measurements or the like. In addition the data can include at least one metric and values thereof that can provide generally indirectly an indication of the at least one mobility condition for instance the metrics can include A 3GPP cell reselection count which provides a low resolution qualitative assessment of movement condition s B automatic gain control AGC trending and the like.

The at least one sensor that can supply data to collection component or to memory or memory elements therein is specific to the wireless equipment that incorporates the example system . Generally in an aspect the type and number of sensors included in the group of one or more sensor s are specific to such wireless equipment. The group of one or more sensor s can include velocimeter s accelerometer s compass es . In addition the group of one or more sensor s can include a radio communication platform not shown that collects data and signaling from a deep space wireless link e.g. satellite based wireless link and a chipset e.g. an integrated circuit that processes the data and signaling to produce data related to the motional state of the wireless equipment. The group of one or more sensor s also can include kinetic generator s that can sense motion of the wireless equipment. Moreover the group of one or more sensor s also can include firmware sensors that exploit a processor to execute an application for collection of data related to operation of the wireless equipment. Such data can be part of or embody one or more metrics e.g. cell reselection counts that convey at least in part a mobility condition of such wireless equipment.

Example system also includes a profile generator component which in the subject disclosure is also referred to as profile generator . Based at least in part on the data related to the motional state of the wireless equipment profile generator updates a mobility profile that conveys the motional state of the wireless equipment. In an aspect the mobile profile can be time dependent such as more fully disclosed herein. Profile generator can update the mobility profile in accordance with a predetermined schedule or at a predetermined update rate where is the update period. In an aspect the update rate can be equal to or smaller than nearly the rate at which data is updated e.g. the smallest or substantially smallest measurement rate associated with a sensor in the group of one or more sensor s . In a scenario in which is smaller than profile generator allows a data accumulation period in which data is collected without an update of the mobility profile. Such data accumulation period can enable reduction of noise in the data utilized to update the mobility profile.

As part of an update the profile generator can generate the mobility profile or modify an extant mobility profile. Generation of the mobility profile includes generation of a record e.g. a field entry in table of at least one of a state variable or a datum e.g. a time a position a velocity an acceleration etc. related to mobility condition of the wireless equipment. Modification of an extant mobility profile includes addition or removal of a record of at least one the state variable of a datum e.g. a time a position a velocity an acceleration etc. related to the mobility condition of the wireless equipment. Moreover as part of an update profile generator retains the mobility profile in memory element the mobility profile can be retained as part of a set of one or more mobility profile s . To generate a record of at least one of the state variable or the datum profile generator can process at least a portion of data acquired from at least one sensor in the group of one or more sensor s . As part of such processing profile generator and apply at least one rule to the portion of data or to data that results from aggregating the portion of the data. In an aspect outcome of the application of the at least one rule establishes a value of the state variable wherein such value conveys the motional state of the wireless equipment. In addition the profile generator can aggregate the portion of data aggregation of the portion of data enables analysis of mobility conditions of the wireless equipment. In certain embodiments as indicated in a previous passage a mobility profile includes a state variable indicative of the motional state of the wireless equipment. In alternative or additional embodiments a mobility profile can include such state variable and at least one dynamic variable e.g. position velocity or acceleration representative of the dynamics of mobile device e.g. trajectory of the mobile device .

In a scenario in which the wireless equipment is a mobile device the mobility profile can convey the motional state of the mobile device through a state variable or a record thereof representative of such state. The state variable or a record thereof is part of the mobility profile and can be an M ary variable e.g. the state variable can adopt M values indicative of motional state here M is a natural number and M 2. Values of the state variable are updated at a rate . In an aspect M 2 and the state variable is a binary variable that can adopt two values indicative of respective motional states. For example a first value can be Launch which can be indicative of a dynamic state of e.g. vehicular mobility condition and a second value can be Land which can be indicative of quasi static state e.g. pedestrian mobility condition . In another aspect M 3 and the state variable can adopt three values of respective motional states 1 Launch 2 Land and 3 Station which can be indicative of a static state or a stationary condition e.g. the wireless equipment is at rest in a position .

A monitor component can monitor a mobility profile e.g. a mobility profile in the group of one or more mobility profile s . As a result monitor component can generate a time series or sampling of a set of values of at least one variable in the monitor profile. Monitor component can monitor de mobility profile in at least two modalities. In a first modality monitor component can subscribe to a service e.g. a daemon in a mobile device with Linux based OS provided by profile generator . The service supplies historical values of at least one variable in the mobility profile or current or last known values of the at least one variable. In a second modality monitor component can access e.g. poll the mobility profile with a predetermined access e.g. polling rate. In particular yet not exclusively monitor component can monitor a state variable in the mobility profile. By monitoring the state variable monitor component can generate and analyze a time series or sampling of the state variable. As part of analysis of the time series monitor component can filter the time series to remove noise related to variations in the time dependent values of the state variable. In an aspect the filtering can be applied in highly dynamic scenarios in which the update rate is high. In addition as part of the analysis of the time series monitor component perform trending of the time series in order to extrapolate prospective values of the state variable and based on trending results estimate stability or persistence of a current or nearly current motional state. Stability or persistence of a current or nearly current motional state can be determined based at least in part on at least one transition criterion retained in transition criteria storage . Furthermore monitor component can extract or identify at least one pattern in the time series wherein the at least one pattern in the series enables identification of a net mobility condition or net motional state. Monitor component can identify the at least one pattern through decomposition of the time series into Fourier components and magnitude thereof. In the alternative or in addition monitor component can identify the at least one pattern through various pattern recognition techniques conventional or proprietary such techniques can be retained in method storage .

With regard to net mobility condition or net motional state such condition or state can be identified in relation to a desired e.g. specified period of time. For example a person having a mobile device may be starting and stopping frequently while moving from one place to a destination in stop and go traffic. In such instance even though the mobile device is observed to be stopping at certain times during the trip to the destination the net motional state of the mobile device can be identified as dynamic state since the mobile device is moving to different locations over time. As another example a person can have a mobile device on a desk and picks the mobile device up briefly as the person goes to get a cup of coffee in the break room and then returns the mobile device to the desk within a relatively short period of time. In this instance even though the mobile device was observed to be moved from the desk the net movement of the mobile device was effectively nil since the mobile device was placed back in the same place e.g. desk after only being moved from that place for a short amount of time. As a result in that instance the net motional state of the mobile device can be identified as static state or quasi static state even though the mobile device was in fact moved for a short amount of time.

As time progresses and in response to monitoring a state variable in the mobility profile monitor component updates e.g. modifies a time series for the state variable wherein as described in preceding passages the state variable conveys motional state of the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device that incorporates example system . Analysis of an updated time series for the state variable leads to an updated net motional state of the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device . Accordingly based on mobility aspects of the wireless equipment monitor component can identify changes from a first net motional state e.g. represented by a first value for a first time series of the state variable to a second net motional state e.g. represented by a second value for a second time series of the state variable. In response to a transition from the first net motional state to the second net motional state monitor component can notify a location report component of such transition. In an aspect monitor component can deliver a notification e.g. signaling and related payload data upon or substantially at an instant in which the transition from to is identified or at an instant after such transition is identified. In an aspect as desired the location report component can estimate location of the mobile device through measurements and analysis of data collected through the measurements for example when a mobility profile change occurs.

In response to reception of a notification indicative of a transition from a first net motional state to a second net motional state location report component can report location of the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device that incorporates example system based on such transition or variation of the motional state of the wireless equipment.

As an example when transition from the first net motional state to the second net motional state represents transition from a quasi static state e.g. pedestrian mobility condition or a static state to a dynamic state e.g. vehicular mobility condition location report component can interrupt at least one procedure for reporting location of the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device . In a scenario in which such transition occurs location report component can halt LAU procedures in response to change in LAC service set identifier SSID or other network location identifier ID . In certain embodiments however location report component can interrupt LAU procedure s in response to change in any network location ID except public land mobile network PLMN ID since a change in PLMN ID entails change in network operator. In the subject disclosure LAU procedures are halted in the dynamic state since current or nearly current location update information e.g. LAC or other network ID is likely to become obsolete prior to an incoming call session directed to the wireless equipment is established as mentioned in a previous passage typical wireless equipment is in idle state for up to about 90 of its operational time. In the subject disclosure incoming call sessions or incoming calls include voice communications and data communications such as multimedia communications video call text message audio communication data communication etc. .

In addition while the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device remains in the dynamic state e.g. vehicular mobility condition incoming call sessions directed to the wireless equipment are conducted according at least in part to flood paging. A mobility management MM component in a network platform delivers incoming pages to a first network location ID e.g. LAC associated with a location in which the motional state of the wireless equipment was quasi static state e.g. pedestrian mobility or static state the first network location ID can be the last known network location ID for the wireless equipment. If a first incoming page delivered to the wireless equipment fails then the MM component delivers incoming pages including the first incoming page to a network location ID adjacent to the first LAC via flood paging as employed in typical paging implementations in 3GPP wireless networks. After flood page response e.g. the incoming call session is established for example a voice call is received the MM component or a network node functionally thereto updates a record of location of the wireless equipment in a network repository e.g. Visited Location Register VLR when the MM component receives a page response from the network location ID e.g. LAC in which the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device is located. The record of the location of the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device embodies the last known network location ID e.g. LAC and subsequent incoming pages are delivered through the MM component for example to such last known network location ID. It is noted that the MM component can be specific to the radio technology implemented for telecommunication through the network platform for instance in 3GPP LTE networks the MM component can be embodied in a mobility management entity MME whereas in the 3GPP UMTS network then MM component can be embodied in a mobility switching center MSC .

In the subject disclosure through interruption of location update procedures in response to transition to a dynamic state e.g. vehicular mobility signaling associated with such location update procedures and related location update activity of the wireless equipment is reduced with respect to conventional telecommunication technologies. Such reduction is accomplished through at the expense of adding flood paging and related signaling to ensure an incoming call session directed to the wireless equipment can be established in the dynamic state.

As another example when transition from the first net motional state to the second net motional state represents transition from the dynamic state e.g. vehicular mobility condition to the quasi static state e.g. pedestrian mobility condition or the static state location report component can initiate at least one procedure for reporting location of the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device . In a scenario in which such transition occurs location report component can trigger a LAU procedure to update the LAC SSID or other network location ID in which the wireless equipment is located after the transition. As a result of such update a network of platform of a network operator that provides wireless service to the wireless equipment acquires information e.g. network location ID such as LAC indicative of a cell site or sector site that serves the wireless equipment e.g. mobile device . The wireless equipment is likely to remain in the cell site or the sector site for a period sufficiently long to establish incoming call session s in the quasi static or static state. Incoming initial pages are directed via a MM component to the cell site or the sector but flood paging also is possible in case an initial incoming page fails. The wireless equipment e.g. mobile device remains in the quasi static state or the static state until it transitions back to the dynamic state e.g. vehicular mobility condition .

In certain embodiments a location reported by location report component can be exploited in location based services such as advertisement or coupons based on location content news weather conditions etc. delivery based on locations location broadcasting for emergency services and CALEA reporting etc. Transition to a quasi static state or a static state can provide sufficient spatial resolution for most any location based services without dedicated measurement or location determination procedures. In addition in view of persistence of a net motional state a location reported by location report component can provide a meaningful spatial reference for most any location services. Reporting of such location can leverage a particular wireless environment such as a local area network LAN to provide customized location based services. For example in a scenario in which a mobile device is determined via inspection of a related mobility profile to have transitioned to a quasi static state location report component can scan the wireless environment for signaling indicative of a LAN e.g. picocell femtocell Wi Fi deployment etc. and identity of the LAN owner which can be broadcasted through pilot messages radiated from an access point of the LAN. If the LAN owner is identified to be a business e.g. a convenience store or coffee shop adjacent to a highway road then the location report component can signal a network node e.g. a server in a service network platform information related to the business. In response the network node can provide specific content advertisement coupons media etc. to the mobile device as part of a location service to which the mobile device is subscribed. As described supra for location based services variation in the motional state of the wireless equipment also can be employed to interrupt and resume location reporting based on aspects of such variation as described hereinbefore.
