The present application relates to novel substituted fused imidazoles and pyrazoles to processes for preparation thereof to the use thereof alone or in combinations for treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to the use thereof for production of medicaments for treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases especially for treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitrogen monoxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to bind to the central iron atom of haem but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.

Through the formation of cGMP and the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in different physiological processes more particularly in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and also in the event of disorders based on disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system can be suppressed which can lead for example to hypertension platelet activation increased cell proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects a possible NO independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.

Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates the effect of which is based on NO. This is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.

A few years ago some substances which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly i.e. without prior release of NO were described for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 . The more recent stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase include BAY 41 2272 BAY 41 8543 and riociguat BAY 63 2521 see for example Stasch J. P. et al. 2006 5 755 768 Stasch J. P. et al. 2009 4 853 865. Stasch J. P. et al. 2011 123 2263 2273 . Interestingly some of these sGC stimulators for example YC 1 or BAY 41 2272 also exhibit PDE5 inhibitory action in addition to direct guanylate cyclase stimulation. In order to maximize the cGMP pathway it is pharmacologically desirable to stimulate the synthesis of cGMP and simultaneously to inhibit degradation via PDE 5. This dual principle is particularly advantageous in pharmacological terms see for example Oudout et al. Eur. Urol. 2011 60 1020 1026. .

The dual principle is fulfilled in the context of the present invention when the inventive compounds exhibit an effect on recombinant guanylate cyclase reporter cell lines according to the study in B 2 as the minimal effective concentration MEC of 3 M and exhibit inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 5 PDE5 according to the study in B 6 as IC 100 nM.

Phosphodiesterase 5 PDE5 is the name of one of the enzymes which cleave the phosphoric ester bond in cGMP forming 5 guanosine monophosphate 5 GMP . In humans phosphodiesterase 5 occurs predominantly in the smooth musculature of the corpus cavernosum penis and the pulmonary arteries. Blockage of cGMP degradation by inhibition of PDE5 with for example sildenafil vardenafil or tadalafil leads to increased signals of the relaxation signalling pathways and specifically to increased blood supply in the corpus cavernosum penis and lower pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels. They are used for treatment of erectile dysfunction and of pulmonary arterial hypertension. As well as PDE5 there are further exclusively cGMP cleaving phosphodiesterases Stasch J. P. et al. 2011 .

M. Becker et al. 1 13 2001. WO 2004 009590 describes pyrazolopyridines with substituted 4 aminopyrimidines for treatment of CNS disorders. WO 2010 065275 and WO 2011 149921 disclose substituted pyrrolo and dihydropyridopyrimidines as sGC activators. As sGC stimulators WO 2012 004259 describes fused aminopyrimidines and WO 2012 004258 WO 2012 143510 and WO 2012 152629 fused pyrimidines and triazines. WO 2012 28647 discloses pyrazolopyridines with various azaheterocycles for treatment of cardiovascular disorders.

It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors dual principle and have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to the compounds known from the prior art for example with respect to their in vivo properties for example their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and or their metabolic profile and or their dose activity relationship.

Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically compatible salts of the inventive compounds. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used for example for isolation or purification of the inventive compounds.

Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds include acid addition salts of mineral acids carboxylic acids and sulphonic acids for example salts of hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulphuric acid phosphoric acid methanesulphonic acid ethanesulphonic acid toluenesulphonic acid benzenesulphonic acid naphthalenedisulphonic acid formic acid acetic acid trifluoroacetic acid propionic acid lactic acid tartaric acid malic acid citric acid fumaric acid maleic acid and benzoic acid.

Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds also include salts of conventional bases by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts e.g. sodium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium and magnesium salts and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms by way of example and with preference ethylamine diethylamine triethylamine ethyldiisopropylamine monoethanolamine diethanolamine triethanolamine dicyclohexylamine dimethylaminoethanol procaine dibenzylamine N methylmorpholine arginine lysine ethylenediamine and N methylpiperidine.

In the context of the invention solvates refer to those forms of the inventive compounds which in solid or liquid state form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of the solvates in which the coordination is with water. Preferred solvates in the context of the present invention are hydrates.

Depending on their structure the inventive compounds may exist in different stereoisomeric forms i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or if appropriate also as conformational isomers enantiomers and or diastereomers including those in the case of atropisomers . The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically homogeneous constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and or diastereomers in a known manner chromatography processes are preferably used for this in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.

If the inventive compounds can occur in tautomeric forms the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms.

The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the inventive compounds. An isotopic variant of an inventive compound is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the inventive compound has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into an inventive compound are those of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulphur fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine such as H deuterium H tritium C C N O O P P S S S S F Cl Br I I I and I. Particular isotopic variants of an inventive compound especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated may be beneficial for example for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. Furthermore the incorporation of isotopes for example of deuterium can lead to particular therapeutic advantages as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound for example an extension of the half life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required such modifications of the inventive compounds may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the inventive compounds can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and or starting compounds.

In addition the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the inventive compounds.

A commercially available telemetry system from DATA SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL DSI USA is used for the blood pressure measurement on conscious rats described below.

The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record blood pressure heart rate and body motion of conscious animals in their usual habitat.

The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR Okamoto with a body weight of 200 g. SHR NCrl from the Okamoto Kyoto School of Medicine 1963 were a cross of male Wistar Kyoto rats with greatly elevated blood pressure and female rats having slightly elevated blood pressure and were handed over at F13 to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

After transmitter implantation the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water.

The day night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6 00 am and at 7 00 pm.

The TA11 PA C40 telemetry transmitters used are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be used repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.

For the implantation the fasted animals are anaesthetized with pentobarbital Nembutal Sanofi 50 mg kg i.p. and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba the liquid filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue VetBonD 3M . The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle and the wound is closed layer by layer.

An antibiotic Tardomyocel COMP Bayer 1 ml kg s.c. is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.

Unless stated otherwise the substances to be studied are administered orally by gavage to a group of animals in each case n 6 . In accordance with an administration volume of 5 ml kg of body weight the test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5 tylose.

The telemetry measuring unit present is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number Vyear month day .

Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna 1010 Receiver DSI .

The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch. They are switched to transmission in the run up to the experiment. The signals emitted can be detected online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for WINDOWS DSI and processed accordingly. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.

The acquisition of measurements is repeated under computer control at 5 minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute values are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor APR 1 and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the extensive documentation from the manufacturer company DSI .

Unless stated otherwise the test substances are administered at 9.00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours.

After the end of the experiment the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software Dataquest A.R.T. ANALYSIS . The blank value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration and so the selected data set encompasses the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am the following day.

The data are smoothed over an adjustable period by determination of the average 15 minute average and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred to Excel templates and tabulated. For each day of the experiment the data obtained are stored in a dedicated file bearing the experiment number. Results and test protocols are filed in order in paper form sorted by numbers.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of the inventive compounds are determined in male CD 1 mice male Wistar rats and female beagles. Intravenous administration in the case of mice and rats is effected by means of a species specific plasma DMSO formulation and in the case of dogs by means of a water PEG400 ethanol formulation. In all species oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage based on a water PEG400 ethanol formulation. The taking of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The operation is effected at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anaesthesia and administration of an analgesic atropine rimadyl 3 1 0.1 ml s.c. . The blood is taken generally more than 10 time points within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. When the blood is taken it is passed into heparinized tubes. Then the blood plasma is obtained by centrifugation and is optionally stored at 20 C. until further processing.

An internal standard which may also be a chemically unrelated substance is added to the samples of the inventive compounds calibration samples and qualifiers and there follows protein precipitation by means of acetonitrile in excess. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions and subsequent vortexing is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by means of LC MS MS using C18 reversed phase columns and variable eluent mixtures. The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.

The plasma concentration time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC C t terminal half life MRT mean residence time and CL clearance using a validated pharmacokinetic calculation program.

Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma it is necessary to determine the blood plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g the plasma concentration is measured by means of LC MS MS see above and determined by calculating the ratio of the c cvalue.

To determine the metabolic profile of the inventive compounds they are incubated with recombinant human cytochrome P450 CYP enzymes liver microsomes or primary fresh hepatocytes from various animal species e.g. rats dogs and also of human origin in order to obtain and to compare information about substantially the complete phase I and phase II metabolism and about the enzymes involved in the metabolism.

The inventive compounds were incubated with a concentration of about 0.1 10 M. For this purpose stock solutions of the inventive compounds having a concentration of 0.01 1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared and then pipetted with 1 100 dilution into the incubation mixture. The liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP 10 mM glucose 6 phosphate and 1 unit glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium likewise at 37 C. After an incubation time of 0 4 h the incubation mixtures were stopped with acetonitrile final concentration approx. 30 and the protein was centrifuged off at approx. 15 000 g. The samples thus stopped were either analysed directly or stored at 20 C. until analysis.

The analysis is effected by means of high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection HPLC UV MS MS . For this purpose the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18 reversed phase columns and variable eluent mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution or 0.05 formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass spectrometry data serve for identification structural elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolite and for quantitative metabolic assessment of the inventive compound in the incubation mixtures.

Subsequently 50 l of a dilution of the above described PDE 5 preparation are added. The dilution of the PDE 5 preparation is selected such that during the later incubation less than 70 of the substrate is converted typical dilution 1 100 dilution buffer 50 mM tris hydrochloric acid pH 7.5 8.3 mM magnesium chloride 1.7 mM EDTA 0.2 BSA . The substrate 8 H cyclic guanosine 3 5 monophosphate 1 Ci l Perkin Elmer is diluted 1 2000 with assay buffer 50 mM tris hydrochloric acid pH 7.5 8.3 mM magnesium chloride 1.7 mM EDTA to a concentration of 0.0005 Ci l. By addition of 50 l 0.025 Ci of the diluted substrate the enzyme reaction is finally started. The test mixtures are incubated at room temperature for 60 min and the reaction is stopped by adding 25 l of a suspension of 18 mg ml yttrium scintillation proximity beads in water phosphodiesterase beads for SPA assays RPNQ 0150 Perkin Elmer . The microtitre plates are sealed with a film and left to stand at room temperature for 60 min Subsequently the plates are analysed for 30 s per well in a Microbeta scintillation counter Perkin Elmer . ICvalues are determined using the graphic plot of the substance concentration against percentage PDE 5 inhibition.

The organ protective effects of the sGC stimulators were shown in a therapeutically relevant low nitric oxide NO high renin hypertension model in rats. The study procedure was based on the recently published publication Sharkovska Y Kalk P Lawrenz B Godes M Hoffmann L S Wellkisch K Geschka S Relle K Hocher B Stasch J P. NO independent stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase reduces target organ damage in low and high renin models of hypertension. J. Hypertension. 2010 28 1666 1675 . This involved treating renin transgenic rats TGR mRen2 27 to which the NO synthase inhibitor L NAME had been administered via drinking water simultaneously with an sGC stimulator or vehicle over several weeks. Haemodynamic and renal parameters were determined during the treatment period. At the end of the long term study organ protection kidney lung heart aorta was shown by histopathological studies biomarkers expression analyses and cardiovascular plasma parameters.
