The present disclosure is generally directed toward communications and more specifically toward contact centers.

Contact centers can provide numerous services to customers. The customers expect all contact center services to be provided efficiently and correctly. If there are issues on calls and or with particular agents the issues may create a serious liability for the contact center. A contact center manager is responsible for addressing and correcting the issues before the issues become expensive and or create customer dissatisfaction. Once the contact center manager identifies a problem with a particular call and or agent action needs to be taken to rectify the problem as soon as possible. Examples of issues on calls might include calls that have been waiting too long leaving calls on hold too long the agent getting angry etc.

Common methods for the contact center manager to monitor the agent include the use of a reporting system that utilizes threshold checks system wide audits speech analytics and watchdog timers to take snapshots of the system capture issues and generate reports and alerts. The reports and the alerts currently rely on the contact center manager s proactive diligent monitoring and availability to take corrective action. Though reports alerts and other types of audits are common and useful tools most contact centers just live with the limitations created by manual follow up.

These and other needs are addressed by the various aspects embodiments and or configurations of the present disclosure. The present disclosure is directed to a bot agent solution that can detect problem calls for a contact center manager thereby enabling a new level of efficiency for issue resolution. A bot agent module is proposed herein that is capable of deploying bot agents as readying agents with flexible strategy and matching features.

When contact centers were first created the contact centers were typically small operations that were in one location servicing one company. Contact centers at the time were relatively easy to manage where managers could reasonably keep an eye on agents and agent performance. The manager could walk around check on or listen in on calls and chat with agents about issues and challenges. As contact centers have grown in complexity the number of tasks that must be handled have increased exponentially creating significantly greater management challenges.

Today s contact centers are often distributed with multiple locations and networks typically configured to use a Call Management System CMS and an Automatic Call Distributor ACD to manage routing goals statistics etc. This distributed architecture can often reduce or eliminate the manager s ability to walk around and check on agents and problems and the large number of work items makes it virtually impossible for managers to watch every single transaction.

To address the growing management challenges of complexity and distribution and to automate certain functions bot agents may be employed in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Bot agents in one embodiment are real call and or readying agents put into service by the contact center manager. Bot agents can be injected into the contact center to be matched to a problem agent and or selected calls. Scheduled bots have the ability to go ready like actual calls and or agents and reschedule themselves to go ready again once they have completed a task. In some embodiments bot agents can adjust scheduling time depending upon the series of matches that are made or not made between the bot agent and a call and or agent.

In some embodiments bot agents are provided with customized matching strategies. Customized matching strategies can allow for variable rescheduling and can specifically allow the bot agent to seek out certain types of agents and or calls inactive problemed stuck etc . When the scheduled bot agents are matched to agents and or calls the scheduled bot agents may mark the agents and or calls with a high priority so that the manager can get involved. Properties on the marked agent and or marked call can be updated and can optionally trigger the marked agent or call to initiate or schedule his or her own matching event. The scheduled bot agent may also change properties on the call and or the agent and trigger a match scan. Additionally the scheduled bot agents can initiate new events e.g. additional work items calendar items for a manager tasks for an agent training for an agent training for a manager etc. to help resurrect problems as programmed by the scheduled bot agent s strategy. The scheduled bot agent in some embodiments can change its own matching strategy so that a series of auditing strategies can be executed by a single scheduled bot agent.

When the manager makes a bot agent call or becomes a readying agent he or she can indicate the type of matching strategy that he or she wants for that call and or agent. For example a manager could make a call with the strategy to match for inactive agents greater than 5 minutes or the manager could be a readying agent and use a matching strategy for work that has been queued for one hour or longer. When the manager uses the bot agent to match to an agent and or a call he or she can talk with the caller and or the agent that has been selected according to the matching strategy defined by the manager.

In some embodiments a bot agent may or may not be connected to or associated with a real person. Another feature with scheduled or real time bot agents is that they can go automatically ready again after the matched call or agent hangs up and attempt to match again on another call and or agent without requiring additional input from a manager or system administrator. If there are no matches then the bot agents can reschedule to re ready again and rescan for a match at a later time. Bots agents can adjust their reschedule time change their own strategies and update the matching call or agent without connecting voice paths. Thus in some embodiments there would be no need for administration changes to manage wayward calls and or agents when the bot agents are actively monitoring and automatically adjusting and marking within the system.

In a non limiting example a bot agent would assist with Service Observing SO for active calls affecting a threshold condition. The manager can use a bot agent that scans work that has already matched to agents with a defined criteria or criterion of handling duration exceeding norms. The bot agent may be represented in the contact center and administered like a normal agent but may possess a special matching strategy. In some embodiments the manager can log in as the bot agent and match and or conference into the active call that has a long handling duration allowing the manager to see if the agent requires additional assistance and or support to complete the call. Once the manager completes participation or determines that the agent doesn t need help the manger may release himself or herself from the call and re ready himself or herself to scan for the next longest duration call to provide support and or assistance.

Another aspect of the present disclosure is to enable a bot agent to be administered such that the bot agent auto readies itself without being associated with a specific terminal or agent work station. This particular type of bot agent may be referred to as a phantom bot agent and the phantom bot agent may be configured to exist in the work assignment engine continuously scanning for work items. When matching the bot agent can conference in other agents and or supervisors. To remove this bot agent the administrator would administer the removal disable of the bot agent or another bot agent call could be initiated to match to this bot agent thereby removing the phantom bot agent.

These and other advantages will be apparent from the disclosure. In some embodiments a method is provided which generally comprises 

configuring a bot agent with a matching criteria that enables the bot agent to be matched with at least one of an agent and work item within a contact center 

scanning with a work assignment engine at least one of a work pool and agent pool of a contact center to determine attributes for at least one of work items and agent within the contact center 

selecting with the work assignment engine at least one of a work item and agent that comprises a set of attributes satisfying the matching criteria and

assigning the bot agent to the selected at least one of a work item and agent such that the bot agent is enabled to interact with the selected at least one of a work item and agent.

The term automatic and variations thereof as used herein refers to any process or operation done without material human input when the process or operation is performed. However a process or operation can be automatic even though performance of the process or operation uses material or immaterial human input if the input is received before performance of the process or operation. Human input is deemed to be material if such input influences how the process or operation will be performed. Human input that consents to the performance of the process or operation is not deemed to be material.

The preceding is a simplified summary of the disclosure to provide an understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is neither an extensive nor exhaustive overview of the disclosure and its various aspects embodiments and or configurations. It is intended neither to identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor to delineate the scope of the disclosure but to present selected concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as an introduction to the more detailed description presented below. As will be appreciated other aspects embodiments and or configurations of the disclosure are possible utilizing alone or in combination one or more of the features set forth above or described in detail below.

In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure the communication network may comprise any type of known communication medium or collection of communication media and may use any type of protocols to transport messages between endpoints. The communication network may include wired and or wireless communication technologies. The Internet is an example of the communication network that constitutes an Internet Protocol IP network consisting of many computers computing networks and other communication devices located all over the world which are connected through many telephone systems and other means. Other examples of the communication network include without limitation a standard Plain Old Telephone System POTS an Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN a Local Area Network LAN a Wide Area Network WAN a Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP network a Session Initiation Protocol SIP network a cellular network and any other type of packet switched or circuit switched network known in the art. In addition it can be appreciated that the communication network need not be limited to any one network type and instead may be comprised of a number of different networks and or network types. As one example embodiments of the present disclosure may be utilized to increase the efficiency of a grid based contact center. Examples of a grid based contact center are more fully described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 469 523 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Moreover the communication network may comprise a number of different communication media such as coaxial cable copper cable wire fiber optic cable antennas for transmitting receiving wireless messages and combinations thereof.

The communication devices may correspond to customer communication devices. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure a customer may utilize their communication device to initiate a work item which is generally a request for a processing resource . Exemplary work items include but are not limited to a contact directed toward and received at a contact center a web page request directed toward and received at a server farm e.g. collection of servers a media request an application request e.g. a request for application resources location on a remote application server such as a SIP application server and the like. The work item may be in the form of a message or collection of messages transmitted over the communication network . For example the work item may be transmitted as a telephone call a packet or collection of packets e.g. IP packets transmitted over an IP network an email message an Instant Message an SMS message a fax and combinations thereof. In some embodiments the communication may not necessarily be directed at the work assignment mechanism but rather may be on some other server in the communication network where it is harvested by the work assignment mechanism which generates a work item for the harvested communication. An example of such a harvested communication includes a social media communication that is harvested by the work assignment mechanism from a social media network or server. Exemplary architectures for harvesting social media communications and generating work items based thereon are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12 784 369 12 706 942 and 12 707 277 each of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The supervisor communication device may correspond to a communication device or collection of devices operated and or controlled by a contact center supervisor or manager. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure a supervisor may utilize the communication device to evaluate or help the servicing of a work item by a resource . The supervisor may utilize the communication device to initiate or respond to interaction regarding work items with the work assignment mechanism a bot agent module elements within or outside of the communication network and to processing resources . In some embodiments the supervisor communication device may correspond to a resource and or be connected within a contact center rather than being connected to a contact center via the communication network .

The work assignment mechanism may employ any queue based or queueless work assignment algorithm. Examples of queue based work assignment skill based algorithms include without limitation a fairness algorithm pacing algorithm which inserts rests into the agents work queue value based algorithms limited algorithms such as Business Advocate by Avaya Inc. and outsourcing algorithms. Other algorithms may consider other types of data inputs and or may treat certain data inputs differently.

The format of the work item may depend upon the capabilities of the communication device and the format of the communication. In particular work items are logical representations within a contact center of work to be performed in connection with servicing a communication received at the contact center and more specifically the work assignment mechanism . The communication may be received and maintained at the work assignment mechanism a switch or server connected to the work assignment mechanism or the like until a resource is assigned to the work item representing that communication at which point the work assignment mechanism passes the work item to a routing engine to connect the communication device to the assigned resource .

Although the routing engine is depicted as being separate from the work assignment mechanism the routing engine may be incorporated into the work assignment mechanism or its functionality may be executed by the work assignment engine .

In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure the customer communication devices and the supervisor communication device s may comprise any type of known communication equipment or collection of communication equipment. Examples of a suitable communication device include but are not limited to a personal computer laptop tablet cellular phone smartphone telephone or combinations thereof. In general each communication device may be adapted to support video audio text and or data communications with other communication devices as well as the processing resources . The type of medium used by the communication device to communicate with other communication devices or processing resources may depend upon the communication applications available on the communication device .

In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure the work item is sent toward a collection of processing resources via the combined efforts of the work assignment mechanism and routing engine . The resources can either be completely automated resources e.g. Interactive Voice Response IVR units processors servers or the like human resources utilizing communication devices e.g. human agents utilizing a computer telephone laptop etc. or any other resource known to be used in contact centers.

As discussed above the work assignment mechanism and resources may be owned and operated by a common entity in a contact center format. In some embodiments the work assignment mechanism may be administered by multiple enterprises each of which has their own dedicated resources connected to the work assignment mechanism .

In some embodiments the work assignment mechanism comprises a work assignment engine which enables the work assignment mechanism to make intelligent routing decisions for work items and or bot agents . In some embodiments the work assignment engine is configured to administer and make work assignment decisions in a queueless contact center as is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 882 950 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

More specifically the work assignment engine can determine which of the plurality of processing resources is qualified and or eligible to receive the work item and further determine which of the plurality of processing resources is best suited or is the optimal processing resource to handle the processing needs of the work item. In situations of work item surplus the work assignment engine can also make the opposite determination i.e. determine optimal assignment of a work item resource to a resource . In some embodiments the work assignment engine is configured to achieve true one to one matching by utilizing bitmaps tables and other data structures.

The work assignment mechanism can communicate with the bot agent module which may provide contact center manager assistance including Service Observing SO active call matching scanning and other features. The work assignment mechanism can communicate with a Call Management System CMS which may provide integrated analysis and reporting on the performance of one agent a group of agents a single contact center site or multiple contact center sites. The bot agent module may additionally integrate CMS data and application data for display and use on a user interface of the communication device . Applications may work in conjunction with the bot agent module providing both native functionality and third party functionality provided by an Application Programming Interface API .

The contact center floor can contain one or more large wall mounted displays commonly referred to as wallboards operable to integrate with data sources. The wallboard may display many types of information including but not limited to RSS feed data statistics e.g. Key Performance Indicators KPIs metrics graphs images announcements alerts thresholds and messages. The contact center can include more or fewer elements and elements of the contact center can be arranged differently and interact differently than those shown in .

Contact center resources may be agents at workstations and may be seated with a view of one or more wallboards . For example Elizabeth Lani and Josh may be resources for the contact center operable to receive and complete work items. Generally the agent can have a workstation that includes a telephone a computer a smart device and other communication devices inside the facility or remote from the contact center floor . As can be appreciated the contact center floor and the agent workstations may comprise more or fewer of the elements listed. One or more supervisors may be available to monitor activities on the contact center floor and to assist restrain and train agents . Omar for example may have a workstation inside the facility or remote from the contact center floor . The supervisor workstation may include a land line telephone a computer a smart device or other communication devices.

In one embodiment the supervisor may have a communication device . One non limiting example of the device is a mobile or cordless device that is connected to other contact center components via wireless connections e.g. 802.11N 3G 4G etc. and capable of browsing telephony and or location. The device may be a telephone or a tablet. More specifically the supervisor communication device may be a telephone or tablet operable to run applications related to the supervision of the contact center floor . The supervisor communication device may be operable to receive calls short message service SMS texts pop ups and data and operable to communicate with a bot agent module and other elements.

As a non limiting example Omar the supervisor may be in charge of a group of agents responsible for new sales and service calls for a satellite broadcasting service. Omar also takes calls emails and instant messages as an individual contributor to the team so Omar finds it difficult to actively monitor all of the agents all of the time. The administrator of the communication system has installed a new bot agent module that Omar is really excited to try. The bot agent is configured to assist Omar in actively monitoring the activities of the agents . Omar and the administrator set goals thresholds metrics and other particulars of the contact center to display on his supervisor workstation computer and smartphone . Once invoked the bot agent may be configured to work immediately looking for issues anomalies problems opportunities etc. based on programming specifically requested by Omar .

The bot agent receives an alert from the communication system that an agent on a call has been on a service call over the five minute threshold set by the administrator for Omar . The bot agent automatically joins the call based on the alert to begin an analysis. One purpose of the analysis is to determine whether or not the agent needs help. The customer on the call with the agent is screaming and using profanity. The communication system is operable to detect via voice analytics that the customer has become unacceptably hostile. The bot agent determines that it would be helpful to have the supervisor Omar join the call. The bot agent marks the call and sends an alert to Omar . The supervisor Omar gets a pop up alert letting him know that agent needs help. Omar pushes a button on his display requesting that the bot agent connect Omar to the call . Omar has had special training to deal with particularly nasty customers and Omar doesn t appreciate the customer attacking one of his agents . Omar sends an instant message to the agent letting the agent know that he is joining. The agent acquiesces and Omar joins the call. Omar uses his training to calm the customer down. Once the issues are resolved Omar the agent and the bot agent leave the call.

Meanwhile the bot agent gets an alert from agent on call . The agent asks for assistance and the bot agent responds. The agent asks for an inventory check and a shipping estimate for three products while entering programming information for the customer. The bot agent is operable to help find this information and doesn t need to get Omar involved. The bot agent queries for this information and returns the quantities and dates to the agent . The agent gives the information to the customer on call . Once the order is complete the bot agent and the agent terminate the call. While the bot agent was helping the agent Omar was able to run reports and email them off to his boss Ivan. Efficiencies are maintained and the agents Omar and Ivan are happy.

The method for bot agent assistance in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure is shown in . Generally the method begins with a start operation and runs as a continuous loop. While a general order for the steps of the method are shown in the method can include more or fewer steps or the order of the steps can be arranged differently than those shown in . The method can be executed as a set of computer executable instructions executed by a computer system and encoded or stored on a computer readable medium. Further the method may also be embodied by a set of gates or other structures in an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA or other configurable hardware component module or system. Hereinafter the method shall be explained with reference to the systems components modules software data structures etc. described in conjunction with .

The method begins at step and continues when a contact center agent human or bot logs in the agent becomes available to process work items step . When the contact center agent human or bot has completed processing a work item the agent will once again be ready to have a new work item assigned thereto. This change of availability is known as going ready. Typically a bot agent at step can go ready and initiate a monitoring process. The bot agent may go ready without being associated with a terminal. The phantom bot agent may live in the matching portion of the work assignment engine scanning work. When matching the bot agent is operable to conference in agents and supervisors .

The bot agent may also monitor statistics to see how well agents are handling work items that are being monitored. Statistics might include but are not limited to Average Call Handle Time ACHT which may include total talk time and wrap time divided by the total number of calls Service Level SL which may indicate the percentage of calls answered within a certain amount of time e.g. 30 seconds Abandon Rate ABN which may be the number of dropped calls divided by total incoming calls Average Speed Answer ASA which may be the average number of seconds or minutes it takes to answer a call Longest Wait Time LWT and Average Wait Time AWT for incoming calls and Calls in Queue CIQ which may indicate how many calls are pending waiting for agent handling. The bot agent may additionally monitor data from speech analytics and contextual programs to determine how well agents are handling work items. A definition of a low performing agent can be customized using the work assignment engine . Customized strategies are not required to match strategies for incoming customer calls. The customized strategy may be used internally for the supervisor to find low performing agents . Examples of a custom low peak performing agent strategy might compare metrics like recent handling duration times versus best handling duration times and revenue handling times versus best revenue handling times. Matching and comparison may be automated with a bot agent call.

In addition to active monitoring of available data the bot agent may be available on demand from the agent . In step the agent may send an alert and or signal of some kind to the bot agent requesting assistance. The request may be in a form including but not limited to a call a sequence of tones an email a text a button push on a user interface etc.

In step a communication system may send an indicator and or an alert to the bot agent when certain performance indicators e.g. KPIs exceed a threshold or expected value. Based on predetermined matching and comparison values the bot agent may begin an evaluation as to whether or not the agent needs assistance. If the agent does not need assistance the process may begin again with the bot agent returning to a ready state step . In step the bot agent may make a determination that the agent needs assistance. If the answer to the query is yes the bot agent may mark and or join the call in step to further evaluate the assistance needed. The supervisor may be alerted by the bot agent and or the work assignment engine in step . If the supervisor does not need to join the call the bot agent may automatically assist the agent without requiring manual input in step . In response to the need to join the call the supervisor may check data from the communication system including a work item ticket thresholds statistics metrics and or see the agent s desktop using native and or third party applications. If the supervisor feels that action is warranted the supervisor may join the call and or initiate additional service observing features in step .

For example if Josh has been on a call for ten minutes over the threshold Omar may join the call and listen in. If Omar has additional concerns he may initiate recording an IM session with Josh and pull up the customer s account information and history. Once Omar disconnects in step and the bot agent leaves the call in step the process may loop back to the beginning and the monitoring bot agent may go ready in step .
