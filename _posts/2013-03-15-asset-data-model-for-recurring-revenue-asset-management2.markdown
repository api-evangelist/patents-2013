The current application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 661 299 filed on Jun. 18 2012 and entitled Recurring Revenue Asset Management System and Method. This application is also related to co pending and co owned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 844 306 13 895 276 13 895 294 13 844 002 13 895 302 13 842 035 and 13 842 398. The disclosure of each document identified in this paragraph is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The subject matter described herein relates to data processing and management and more particularly to processing and managing recurring revenue asset information.

Innovations in products or marketing the introduction of new or improved products sales to new customers or additional sales to existing customers and other approaches to expanding the amount of market share controlled by a company or other commercial entity have historically been primary drivers for revenue growth. However as markets mature and consolidate a larger fraction of revenue realized by a commercial entity used herein to refer broadly to a company corporation organization person group of persons or the like that undertakes commercial activity including but not limited to sales of products and or services to customers may be derived from renewals of recurring revenue assets. As used herein a recurring revenue asset can generally refer to one or more of maintenance and or support agreements for software or hardware service covered products service contracts subscription agreements warranties renewables or the like.

Many commercial entities fail to maximize realization of revenue from recurring revenue assets at least in part because management of such assets is not well supported by currently available approaches. Currently available tools for managing recurring revenue are spread across customer relationship management CRM systems partner relationship management PRM systems data warehouses entitlement systems billing systems and even spreadsheets or the like. However recurring revenue management presents a number of challenges that differ in substantial and important ways from the typical focus of the sales staff of a commercial entity.

A typical sales process involves closing a sale or deal and moving on to a next customer. In contrast a recurring revenue relationship is by definition repetitive and is not efficiently tracked or managed by tools designed to support initial sales. In addition the commercial entity s existing investments in sales personnel sales processes and information systems are typically directed to and are optimized and supported with appropriate technology for achieving maximum revenue performance in the product or services sales business not the management of recurring revenue streams and the sales activities necessary to ensure that recurring revenue assets are maintained and even increased in value. Optimizing the recurring revenue such as service contracts and other service assets requires resolving challenges that span multiple areas of a company s operations. In today s ever changing market landscape service revenues have become integrally related to the success of a commercial entity. The problem however is that as commercial entities begin to recognize the need for this updated focus they run into a host of challenges for which they are not prepared.

For example a company often has to deal with fragmented data from disparate sources and this data can be inaccurate incomplete and sometimes duplicated particularly in a sales channel or when selling through the channel. Further in the case of a merger or acquisition various legacy systems lead to complexity. Another challenge is a lack of specialization toward service contracts or service renewals. Most company data is centered on the products it sells rather than the services contracted post sale of those products. A lack of industry focus on recurring service revenue has lead to a dearth of standard metrics and proven best practices.

Previously available approaches to recurring revenue management have not included a unified repository or even any other way of collecting and organizing these types of information that are important to optimizing recurring revenue sales that integrates data from multiple disparate external client systems in support of an asset data model capable of resolving the key questions of what e.g. services serviceable products etc. has been purchased who e.g. which commercial entity made the purchase or purchases who is the end user of the purchased services or serviceable products where are the purchased services or serviceable products being used how are the purchased services or serviceable products being used how satisfied is the end user and optionally other at the commercial entity with the purchased services or serviceable products where are other opportunities for sales of additional related or unrelated services to the commercial entity as a result of the sale of the purchased services or serviceable products and the like. Furthermore software systems to automate and optimize the recurring revenue market have generally been limited in regards to analytics specific and relevant to recurring revenue assets well developed key performance indicators KPIs for management of such assets the ability to acquire and aggregate the data streams and other useful features that support optimization of recurring revenue sales and renewals.

Consistent with one or more aspects of the current subject matter a recurring revenue repository can receive and store recurring revenue information from one or more external data sources. The receiving and storing of the data can be performed in a manner that allows rapid use of data accumulated from disparate data streams and in line cleaning of these data while they are also accessible to end users. Some aspects of the current subject matter can include generation of a recurring revenue asset data model from at least a portion of this recurring revenue information. The recurring revenue asset data model can represent relationships among recurring revenue assets and organizations people and products associated with the recurring revenue assets and the like. A number of analytics and business intelligence processes can optionally be executed on the recurring revenue asset data model and on the recurring revenue information in the recurring revenue repository.

In general a recurring revenue management system can perform one or more operations which can include one or more of receiving data from one or more external client systems via one or more data feeds translating these one or more data feeds into internal data objects that support the functionality of the recurring revenue management system resolving the data records in the one or more feeds against data records that have already been incorporated into the internal data objects tracking the provenance of the received and incorporated data records as well as changes to instances of the internal data objects that are made as a result of data records received in the one or more feeds and supporting client specific rules for processing of incoming data and handling of data record duplicates data incongruities and other data inconsistencies that can result from execution of an inline master data management approach.

In some aspects of the current subject matter a method includes receiving a unit of data at a recurring revenue management system and extracting data relevant to a predefined data object of a set of predefined data objects from the received unit of data and populating the extracted relevant data to an instance of the predefined data object. The method also includes defining one or more relationships between the instance of predefined data object and at least one other instance of the predefined data object or a second predefined data object. The defining occurs based on a set of parameters associated with the predefined data object and content of the extracted data. The method further includes generating an opportunity for a sale or renewal of a recurring revenue asset based at least in part on the one or more relationships and presenting the generated opportunity to a user.

In optional variations one or more additional features can be included in any feasible combination. The generated opportunity can be presented to a user. A representation of the opportunity can be generated for display in a display device connected with the at least one processor. A representation of the opportunity can be generated for display in a display device connected with the at least one processor. At least one of the one or more relationships can be inferred based on a transitivity analysis by the recurring revenue management system between the instance of the predefined data object and the at least one other instance of the predefined data object or the second predefined data object. The opportunity can include one or more offers that relate to renewal of one or more service assets of the recurring revenue asset.

Implementations of the current subject matter can include but are not limited to systems and methods including one or more features as described herein as well as articles that comprise a tangibly embodied machine readable medium operable to cause one or more machines e.g. computers etc. to result in operations consistent with these features. Similarly computer systems are also described that may include one or more processors and one or more memories coupled to the one or more processors. A memory which can include a computer readable storage medium may include encode store or the like one or more programs that cause one or more processors to perform one or more of the operations described herein. Computer implemented methods consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter can be implemented by one or more data processors residing in a single computing system or multiple computing systems. Such multiple computing systems can be connected and can exchange data and or commands or other instructions or the like via one or more connections including but not limited to a connection over a network e.g. the Internet a wireless wide area network a local area network a wide area network a wired network or the like via a direct connection between one or more of the multiple computing systems etc.

The details of one or more variations of the subject matter described herein are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages of the subject matter described herein will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims. While certain features of the currently disclosed subject matter are described for illustrative purposes in relation to an enterprise resource software system or other business software solution or architecture it should be readily understood that such features are not intended to be limiting. The claims that follow this disclosure are intended to define the scope of the protected subject matter.

This document describes recurring revenue management systems and methods techniques etc. relating to operations and functionality in support of recurring revenue management. Consistent with implementations of the current subject matter a recurring revenue management system can include a recurring revenue repository that stores data relating to recurring revenue assets which are discussed in greater detail below. A unified data store model can be provided to manage both transactional and analytical uses of data. In some implementations of the current subject matter the use of dynamically generated and updated in memory data structures including but not limited to data cubes and the like can facilitate rich analytical exploration of data in near real time thereby allowing adaptation to customer specific dimensions and metrics. In some implementations of the current subject matter an analytics framework supports role specific dashboards and a plug in model with rich representational state transfer REST application programming interfaces APIs can be included support use of third party ad hoc analytics products.

Referring again to the recurring revenue assets repository can include information about instances of covered assets e.g. products such as physical items or software licenses etc. that can be sold by a commercial entity to one or more customers of the commercial entity that have been sold. These covered assets form the basis for recurring revenue assets because they constitute an existing instance of a seller purchaser relationship between the commercial entity and the customer who purchased the covered assets. The recurring revenue assets service assets themselves can include among other assets service contracts warranties maintenance agreements and the like sold by the commercial entity to the customer in association with or to provide an ongoing service arrangement for the covered assets.

Because it relates to an existing and ongoing relationship with the customer the information about products and their associated recurring revenue assets that is contained in the recurring revenue assets repository can be used to generate one or more opportunities for renewal of an existing recurring revenue asset to thereby maintain the recurring revenue stream and in some cases to increase the value of the recurring revenue asset for example by selling a higher value agreement service contract etc. to the customer . As used herein opportunities are groupings of offers targeted for execution of a sale to a customer and offers are individual instances of a recurring revenue asset available for renewal. The groupings of offers in an opportunity can include multiple offer instances for the same customer. In some examples the offers grouped into an opportunity can all have expiration dates during a sale period e.g. a month a quarter a year etc. . Opportunities can be collected in the opportunity repository .

Once acted upon by sales staff who make contact with appropriate decision makers at the customer opportunities can be moved into a quotation stage during which quotations related to renewals increases etc. of existing recurring revenue assets can be generated. Quotations which include a transaction offer for a set of offers included in an opportunity can be stored in the quotation repository . As a quotation is transitioned to a deal being closed a booking which refers to a set of offers accepted by a customer can be generated and stored in a bookings repository . Resolution of a booking results in generation of a new recurring revenue asset which can be retained in the recurring revenue asset repository for use in generating future offers and opportunities. For example when a resolved service contract or the like approaches its next expiration a new offer for renewal of that service contract can be generated and optionally grouped with other offers for the same customer with similarly timed expiration dates into a new opportunity. Additional data that impact the generation of opportunities and execution of those opportunities is contact information for the decision makers and other important contacts e.g. individuals and companies involved in the sales process with whom sales staff need to communicate. This contact information can be stored in the contacts repository .

Efficient and structured assembly of the information contained in the repositories depicted in can be an important aspect of a recurring revenue management approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter. However much of this information is typically contained or at least originates in other data management systems referred to herein as external client systems than the recurring revenue management system as discussed in greater detail below in reference to . The term client is used herein to refer to a commercial entity that employs features or functions of a recurring revenue management system provided or supported by a recurring revenue management vendor or service provider. Effectively as used herein the client is a commercial entity that is a customer of the recurring revenue management vendor or service provider. The client commercial entity in turn has customers to whom the client has sold and or wishes to sell or renew recurring revenue assets such as those described elsewhere herein. A customer of a client commercial entity typically has an installed base of products for which the customer can purchase various service agreements contracts etc. In effect the products in the installed base of products can be considered as covered assets for which the commercial entity can sell to the customer one or more service contracts agreements etc. From the perspective of the client commercial entity these service contracts agreements etc. can be considered to be service assets or recurring revenue assets.

A recurring revenue management approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can be configurable for the storage retrieval searching and analysis of a wide range of recurring revenue information. Data relating to service assets or other recurring revenue assets referred to herein as recurring revenue data can include information pertaining to what a commercial entity has sold such as for example services products for which related services can be sold etc. e.g. the covered assets . Recurring revenue data can also include information about the purchasers users locations of use modes of use etc. of such services serviceable products etc. In other words the recurring revenue data can include information about what recurring revenue assets an entity has who the customers and users of the recurring revenue assets are and where and how the recurring revenue assets are being used. Recurring revenue data can further include metrics relating to satisfaction of the customer or user of the recurring revenue asset as well as information relating to potential opportunities for services contract sales e.g. for serviceable products soon to come off warranty etc. and the like.

The recurring revenue management system can import diverse information and of various formats from external client systems into a common asset data model. The asset data model can facilitate a wide range of recurring revenue management capabilities and can provide automated assistance for entity resolution resolving external entities to pre existing entities in the system . The recurring revenue management system maintains provenance information for all information loaded into the system e.g. all recurring revenue data from each of the one or more data sources to be able to discern information origin.

As noted above in reference to a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can receive and assign a usable structure to information obtained from a variety of external clients systems . shows a diagram illustrating potential sources of data or other information that can be acquired by or received at a recurring revenue management system . Among other possible data sources the external client systems referenced in can include one or more of an entitlement system an order management system a pricing system a product master database a sales force automation system a customer master database and a contract management system . It will be understood that the individual external client systems shown in can in some implementations of the current subject matter be provided by one or more systems that support features of more than one such external system. For example external client systems can include customer relationship management CRM systems enterprise resource planning ERP systems business intelligence BI systems calendar and contact systems or databases customer service systems inventory systems accounts receivable systems sources of customer usage and engagement information and the like. In general a commercial entity acquires these various systems databases and the like from a more than one different software or computing system provider each of which typically uses distinct database structures data formats report configurations application programming interfaces APIs and the like that are optimized for the specific tasks to be performed by its product. Assembly of information from a group of data sources with multiple potentially disparate database structures and data formats can present a challenge for any system that seeks to collect such information present it in a usable format support detailed analytics based on the data etc. Further challenges can be presented by the need to authenticate potentially conflicting information received from more than one source. Additionally information collected in a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter is typically not static. Rather users interacting with the system are likely to update or correct the information based on communications with contacts etc. Execution of tasks depicted in can also alter the correct version of some of the information received into the recurring revenue management system.

An approach to this problem typically involves receipt of the data at the recipient system from a source system creation of customized mappings or application of pre created mappings between data structures of each source system and the data structures of the recipient system and transformation of the data from the source system data structures to the recipient system data structures according to the mappings. Subsequent to import of data from the data sources but prior to making the imported data available for productive use by end users at the recipient system one or more quality control operations generally occur to ensure consistency of the imported data to identify duplicate and potentially conflicting records and to alert one or more users with appropriate permissions levels to the presence of any errors partial imports missing data or the like. For export of data from the recipient system back to the source system a similar process can be undertaken with the mapping being performed in reverse.

For an active recurring revenue management system particularly one supporting recurring revenue asset management for a large commercial entity with a sizable sales staff a large number of recurring revenue assets and a complicated information landscape in which multiple systems maintain data records relevant to support of recurring revenue management activities a quality control process that interrupts productive use of the system subsequent to a data import is not desirable. For example in a large enterprise with multiple data streams quality control could be quite time consuming. Additionally in the interest of having the most current information available for use by the recurring revenue management system frequent data imports can be advantageous. However if each such import were to require substantial downtime for the import and transformation processes to complete and quality assurance routines to execute usability of features supported by the recurring revenue management system would be negatively impacted.

A recurring revenue management approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can include synchronization and integration of data with a variety of disparate external client systems. For example a recurring revenue management system can access data records and formatted data from systems such as entitlement systems order management systems customer master systems product master systems and service delivery systems. The data from these external client systems is usually not static. Accordingly it is important that a recurring revenue management system be able to receive data feeds from such systems at a high throughput rate. Furthermore the received data is advantageously usable either upon receipt at the recurring revenue management system or at least within a very short processing time.

Alternatively or in addition to the use of an IaaS provider or other middleware for transforming data from a first data structure at the data sources to a second data structure at the recurring revenue management system one or more external client systems can be served by an integration gateway or service bus at the data source layer . The integration gateway or service bus can perform similar functions to the IaaS provider for example for on premise applications databases or file shares of the commercial entity that are better served by a locally installed integration platform than a cloud based approach such as an IaaS provider . A data ingestion pipeline consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can advantageously integrate a large number of inbound record types into a more limited focused set of data object types that directly support recurring revenue management operations.

Typically the data supplied to the data ingestion pipeline is not structured in the same way as it will ultimately be represented in the system. One specific structural mismatch issue is that incoming data can be highly fragmented. For example a single asset data object in the system may need to be constructed through the loading and merging of multiple source objects that are not guaranteed to enter the ingestion pipeline in any particular order or within any specified time frame. To address this challenge the system constructs skeletal objects that hold a partial state of the final object and that include annotations that the system uses for future resolution. As additional fragments arrive the data ingestion pipeline uses matching algorithms to coalesce new skeletal objects with existing skeletal objects into a whole object like an asset object a product object or the like. One example of a matching approach is to match external identifier strings that are added as annotations to the skeletal objects at load time to other annotations on previously loaded objects that also retain similar external identifier strings. Support for external identifier strings can be included as part of the structure of data objects that make up an asset data model consistent with implementations of the current subject matter.

Consistent with implementations of the current subject matter a recurring revenue management system and an included asset data model can include product data objects recurring revenue asset data objects opportunity data objects and contact data objects . Product data objects represent products e.g. covered assets which as noted above in reference to can include items sold to customers and can be considered as part of the customer s installed base of covered assets. A framework of data objects can include a set of common relationships related to recurring revenue management these relationships can include product relationships asset relationships opportunity relationships and contact relationships . Products can provide the basis for a recurring revenue assets represented by instances of asset data objects via one or more product relationships between a product represented by a product data object and the instances of an asset data object representing the recurring revenue asset or assets. Product relationships can also optionally exist between products represented by a product data object and one or more of recurring revenue assets represented by instances of asset data objects opportunities represented by instances of opportunity data objects contacts represented by instances of contact objects other products represented by other instances of a product data object etc.

Further with reference to asset relationships can exist between a recurring revenue asset represented by an instance of an asset data object and one or more of a product represented by an instance of a product data object a contact represented by an instance of a contact data object e.g. a person organization etc. relevant to a recurring revenue asset an opportunity represented by an instance of an opportunity data object e.g. a bundle of offers relating to renewal of existing recurring revenue streams and or to establishment of new or increased value recurring revenue streams another recurring revenue asset represented by another instance of an asset data object etc.

Opportunity relationships can exist between an opportunity represented by an instance of an opportunity data object and one or more of a specific recurring revenue asset represented by an instance of an asset data objects a product represented by an instance of a product data object underlying the recurring revenue asset s a contact represented by another instance of a contact data objects another opportunity represented an instance of an opportunity data object etc. Contact relationships can exist between a contact represented by an instance of a contact data object and one or more of a recurring revenue asset represented by an instance of an asset data object for example based on communications relating to an initial sale of a recurring revenue asset and or to one or more renewals of the recurring revenue asset a product represented by an instance of a product data object underlying the recurring revenue asset s an opportunity represented by an instance of an opportunity data object another contact represented by another instance of a contact data object etc.

The data objects discussed above can optionally also be extendible for example through customer specific extensions fields. Additional custom objects can be added to a customer s configuration. In addition the set of base relationships can be extended to match specific requirements of the commercial entity using the recurring revenue management system . Relationships between instance of the product data object the asset data object the opportunity data object and the contact data object can be established based on one or more of the data received from the incoming data streams existing data in the recurring revenue management system user input and the like. The instances of the data objects and the defined relationships between these instances together make up the asset data model .

An asset data model such as that described herein can provide a useful vehicle for exploring and understanding relationships that exist among product objects asset objects organization objects contact objects and opportunity objects. Many of these relationships are directly derived from information that exists in source client systems while others require inference on the part of the system others are generated by the system as part of object generation others are created as a side effect of system actions and still others are constructed as a result of actions by system users. In an illustrative but not limiting example of an inference approach to generation of the relationships between objects a relationship inference includes exploitation of transitivity e.g. if a relates to b and b relates to c a relationship can be instantiated between a to c and an automated instantiation of inverse relationships if a relates to b then there exists an inverse relationship from b to a .

A consistent approach to managing opportunities quotes and bookings activities can be provided through one or more features supported by an asset data model consistent with implementations of the current subject matter. Such features can include but are not limited to detailed reports pipeline dashboards opportunity details territory management and the like. Detailed reports allow sales representatives to proactively identify and address at risk opportunities while pipeline dashboards allow managers to view pacing of sales activities by time period and production metrics. Opportunity details can allow viewing of deal progress and logged activities by sales representative sales operations assistants managers and other staff. Territory management allows managers to drive sales representatives behavior by assigning tasks to opportunities based on existing priorities. Territory can refer to divisions of available opportunities based on one or more factors which can include but are not limited to geography customer groupings subject matter etc.

Through the asset data model a clearer picture can be presented to users e.g. sales staff sales support staff managers executives etc. of the installed base of products services etc. that have been previously sold to customers of the commercial entity and that provide the foundation for new and renewal sales of recurring revenue assets. Management of this installed base using an asset data model can improve accuracy and insight into the customer base and enable leveraging of this installed base data to maximize recurring revenue streams. Increased sales can be achieved through improved quote accuracy consolidation identification of cross sell and up sell opportunities better handling of renewal contacts and processes and the like. Service delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction can be increased through improved entitlement shipping and staffing resource planning Prediction of customer behavior can also improve which can facilitate optimization of sales staff activities.

Among other information that can be received in the inbound data streams and incorporated into appropriate instances of data objects in the asset data model the asset data model can store and organize expiration information for existing recurring revenue assets product information e.g. characterizations of the install base including who what where etc. information relationships e.g. predecessors successors associated opportunities covered products customers partners locations etc. expected value analyses e.g. projected future revenue product margin analyses etc. and the like. These data are advantageously incorporated into the asset data model via the one or more inbound data streams.

A recurring revenue management system including one or more features as described herein can provide a scenario based revenue projection from the recurring revenue repository of service asset data and other recurring revenue data. In some implementations the recurring revenue management system generates a user interface to display a projection of revenue over time from a set of assets based on expiration dates product information projected sales timing and projected sales effectiveness.

A recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can employ an asset data model specialized for recurring revenue asset sales and renewals. The asset data model can include fields related to service timing events service outcomes relationships to other assets and other context specific fields. For example in support of both new sales and renewal sales of recurring revenue assets e.g. a new service contract a new subscription etc. a recurring revenue management system can process information received from the external client sources and optionally also updated information generated by sales staff e.g. sales representatives sales support staff etc. and other employees or other persons working on behalf of the commercial entity through the execution of sales contacts ongoing sales and renewal operations and other functions supported by the recurring revenue management system to populate data values in one or more fields relating to one or more of a local opportunity amount a local transaction amount an earliest existing end date an earliest new start date a latest new end date a commit level Red Yellow Black Green or other representational scheme a renewal sales stage a covered product a service product a service product description a client batch quarter a win loss result explanation an existing contract number an existing purchase order number an existing distributor an existing reseller a new distributor a new reseller and the like.

In support of renewal sales of recurring revenue assets e.g. a renewal of an existing contract a value added upsell of an existing contract etc. a recurring revenue management system can process information received from the external client sources and optionally also updated information generated through sales contacts ongoing sales and renewal operations and other functions supported by the recurring revenue management system to populate data values in one or more fields relating to one or more of a not contacted contacted status a quote requested status a quote delivered status a customer commitment status a purchase order received status as closed sale status etc.

The asset data model can also track reasons explanations etc. relating to resolution of an opportunity group of opportunities a single offer etc. e.g. a why regarding a win or loss outcome for a given opportunity or offer . Outcomes can include a closed successful sale a house account e.g. an invalid opportunity perhaps relating to an underlying product or service that a customer once had but has since disposed or or a no service outcome in which the customer simply chooses not to purchase a service agreement or subscription or allows an existing agreement to expire without renewing. One or more reason codes can be included and tracked as part of the asset data model for each type of outcome. These codes can be useful in providing feedback to service salespersons and as additional input data for further analytics and business intelligence processes. For a closed sale an outcome code can include without limitation a backdated sale a long co term sale a short co term sale a discounted sale a multi year advance sale a pricing change sale a re certification fee included sale a renewed at par sale a service downgrade sale a service upgrade sale an uncovered sale or the like. For a house account outcome an outcome code can indicate without limitation one or more of a bad data situation a cancelled contract or agreement a covered service a duplicate service an end of support condition an evergreen billing situation an international transaction a leasing situation an OEM customer an other explanation a product return a sales pullback by the customer or the like. For a no service outcome an outcome code can indicate without limitation one or more of a replacement of the product by the customer a competitive distributed value added reseller DVAR a competitive product replacement another explanation for a competitive service loss a customer cost benefit decision that the customer no longer exists a customer satisfaction driven refusal to buy or renew that the covered product or service is at the end of its service life some other data management issue a decommissioned or otherwise removed from service product a third party maintenance agreement an unresponsive end user an unresponsive value added reseller VAR a no service VAR or the like.

A recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can include a mechanism for coordinating online and offline activities of sales teams and individuals to optimally coincide with expiration or other timing events associated with a service sale. Such mechanisms can include automated workflows that guide when and how customers are contacted when activities such as quote request and quote presentment are executed and when escalations occur. The sales process can incorporate one or more key metrics associated with service sales such as for example resolution rate close rate conversion rate and the like that can be used to optimize performance.

A recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can also implement one or more team coordination processes for pipelines and territories that ensure optimization of team outcomes. The processes metrics and workflows required to drive a sales outcome can be encoded in software and computer program products to enable the recurring revenue management system to perform predictive performance management.

Automated or semi automated forecasting of team based service sales can also be supported by a recurring revenue management system consistent with implementations of the current subject matter. The recurring revenue management system can provide a framework for data collection from representatives based on key sales metrics and which allows representatives to follow a periodic i.e. weekly computer generated discipline process leading to accurate monthly and quarterly sales forecasts. The forecasting processes can incorporate a dual estimation approach where bottom up individual opportunity assessment based and top down expiration date grouping based calculations are employed.

User configured sales automation programs can be used to drive specialized process behavior for specific sets of opportunities and service sales operations. These automation programs can include adaptive quote and bookings management for service sales. Capabilities of adaptive quote and bookings management functionality consistent with one or more implementations of the current subject matter can include quote request categorization e.g. to identify key properties of the quote to guide processing quote request routing e.g. to route a request to a proper resource either human or automated to maximize processing efficiency statistical prediction of quote request outcomes e.g. to predict a probability of rejection and project a required processing time SLA management e.g. to effectively measure on time performance and to guide expectations of quote requestors throughput forecasting and management e.g. to manage workload and properly price quote processing services semi automated bookings reconciliation e.g. to allow reconciling an opportunity based sale such as from a CRM perspective with an external order management system view a dynamic i.e. rules based or algorithmic performance management engine for optimizing work activity allocation and the like.

A recurring revenue management system can further include modules for managing a complex channel partner network. The capabilities of the channel partner network management module s can include one or more of a federated permission model that allows OEMs to efficiently distribute access to opportunities across a multi level network of channel partners incumbency logic that determines which opportunities should be visible to any given channel partner gathering and disseminating forecast information from each channel sales incentive programs that can be executed across the channel self service management by channel partners e.g. to allow management of users and permissions for that partner quote processing management e.g. dynamically across a multi level channel and the like.

A recurring revenue management system can also support holistic analysis of customer success management CSM which can include one or more of service asset analysis sales execution analysis sales operations analysis and the like. These features of SRM can include analytical capabilities to collect and display benchmark comparisons for all aspects of SRM.

Data quality management is also an advantageous feature that can be included in a recurring revenue management approach consistent with implementations of the current subject matter. For example data quality scoring user interaction management to improve data quality data quality templates data provenance tracking and the like can be a part of a recurring revenue management system . A recurring revenue management system can perform master data management across data obtained from a number of disparate and unrelated data sources. Data provided by each of the one or more sources e.g. external client systems can be received at the recurring revenue management system asynchronously continuously discontinuously in a series of discrete batches etc.

Generic techniques and mechanisms for managing data quality and provenance can be included in a recurring revenue management approach. For example each of the data object types included in the asset data model can make use of a data quality template and aggregate statistics to identify quality anomalies in individual objects. A data quality template can be used to generate a quality measurement for an individual object based on a set of field and object level validation rules. In addition a statistical profile can be created for a collection of objects that can be used to identify anomalies by comparison of individual objects to the distribution of similar objects in the collection. In one example individual objects or aggregated groups of objects can be compared to one or more statistical metrics applied to a larger group of objects. The individual objects or groups of objects can be identified as outliers based on exceeding a specified absolute or relative amount of deviance from the statistical metrics for the larger group. The identified outliers can be flagged or otherwise designated as potentially suspect or unreliable data objects.

As noted above at least some of the data included in the asset data model typically arrives in the form of data streams or feeds from external client systems . Data quality controls and analysis can be applied as part of the load process for data received as part of these inbound data streams or feeds thereby permitting quarantining and cleaning of data before it becomes fully operational.

Provisions can also be included for detection and resolution of duplicate data records or duplicate entries for a single data field within a data object . De duplication routines or algorithms can make use of one or more identified key fields whose uniqueness properties are known a priori or can be based on clustering algorithms that identify likely duplication based on one or more measurements of statistical anomaly relative to a larger group of objects or records.

Data provenance tracking and capture can be an advantageous feature at least because understanding the origin of data and the source and context of changes can be very useful in many recurring revenue management scenarios. Data provenance features can also be used to manage situations where multiple perspectives on the state of an object need to be maintained such as changes pending approval by an authoritative source. Consistent with implementations of the current subject matter as data are periodically received at a recurring revenue management system from one or more external client systems these incoming data are mapped to target data objects in the asset data model. In addition each data record or alternatively groupings of one or more data values or fields within a data record if the data record includes more than one value or field can be tagged or otherwise associated with a data reference tag that includes identifying information. The identifying information in the data reference tag can include an indication of the external client system or other source from which a given unit of data were received into the recurring revenue management system. A unit of data that is manually entered or updated by sales staff or other personnel of the commercial entity using the recurring revenue management system can likewise receive an associated data reference tag indicating the origin of that unit of data. The data reference tag can also include other identifying information about its associated unit of data such as for example a date of receipt of that unit of data by the recurring revenue management system a user identifier or role or permission level of a user who manually entered or updated the unit of data etc. Optionally each unit of data tagged in this manner can include a tag history that maintains a history of all data reference tags associated with the unit of data such that a history and source of origin of all changes to the unit of data can be tracked.

The asset data model includes provisions for automated data quality assessment and tracking. Entities in the recurring revenue repository carry quality assessment information and provenance information for example via a mechanism such as the reference tags described above that facilitate problem identification provide statistically based guidance and allow for control of suspect updates i.e. to control the impact on the system of inputs of data that are suspected to be of bad quality or of unconfirmed good quality . For example the system can take in lower quality data and flag it so that it can be quarantined from aggregate calculations. Capabilities of the asset data model can include data load tracking and summary as noted above a direct click through ability that allows viewing of loaded records from a summary view. Data quality and scoring can also be included.

Addition of a reference tag feature to all inbound data from the multiple disparate data streams thereby enables tracking and quality assurance of a range of possible data quality metrics and further supports customized data cleaning rules that can be established by a specific commercial entity with regards to its data. Annotation of objects with reference tags can provide a basis for ongoing bi directional synchronization between the recurring revenue management system and source systems with related data e.g. external client systems . Synchronization rules specified in a configuration of the recurring revenue management system can use the origin information conveyed by the reference tags to make decisions as to how to modify the state of objects in both the recurring revenue management system and source systems. For example using information retained in a reference tag relating to time and date of arrival of a data record or value a set of rules can be applied to resolve conflicts in data values to assign prioritized preferences for presentation of data from one data source over another in the event of conflicts preferences for re propagation of data back to source systems e.g. external client systems based on updates or revisions occurring to the data at the recurring revenue management system e.g. to identify data records or data values that are approved or otherwise acceptable for use in updating overwriting etc. data for one or more sources systems maintained by the commercial entity and the like. A commercial entity using features of a recurring revenue management system can optionally use all or some of a set of default rules a set of entity specific customized rules a combination of default and custom rules or the like in determining which data is to be treated preferentially in the event of a conflict or collision between data provided by two different sources.

In some examples when a user of a recurring revenue management system is presented e.g. via a display element of a computing device with a user interface view including information retained in an asset data model a visual indication can be provided to indicate a data quality score associated with the data objects containing the presented information. In this manner information contained in those objects flagged or otherwise identified as potentially suspect or unreliable can be readily apparent to the user so that he or she can assess the appropriate degree of confidence with which the presented information can be used for example in on going service asset sales activities.

As shown in the data associated with the various assets can be scored according to various factors that are expected to affect quality of the predictions opportunities etc. derived from the underlying data. Data quality scoring can be used for a variety of purposes including one or more of guidance of manual user driven data enhancement efforts through UI controls that can filter and sort objects such as assets by their data quality automated data enrichment processes that repair or enrich objects segmentation of assets to ensure that opportunity generation is only executed on records of requisite quality and the like.

As noted above the asset data model can also support real time or at least nearly or approximately real time reporting and interpretation of service assets installed base total asset value projected revenue and data quality as well as subscriptions planning e.g. evaluating categorizing and prioritizing subscriptions to drive sales programs opportunity generation e.g. creating opportunities based on installed base or subscription planning outcomes. In this manner the asset data model can be used in generation of offers and opportunities for example based on inter data object relationships and information that can be included in or derived from the asset data model . This additional information can include but is not limited to exclusion rules expiration window filters product customer or region filters target selling periods upsell and cross sell opportunities upgrade requirements expected outcome analysis and the like. Aggregate asset analysis based on the information described above can be used to support a variety of business decision making functions. This aggregate asset analysis can optionally include one or more of long range forecasting of future service revenue comparative analysis of service product profitability end of service planning and the like.

Opportunity assignment features consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can include opportunity filtering and bulk editing support for example to correct or update data in the asset data model .

The skeletal instance is partially populated with at least some data extracted from the received unit of data at . The skeletal object instance can be sufficient to support one or more recurring revenue asset sales and renewal functions of the recurring revenue management system such as for example those discussed above and is available for productive use despite being incomplete relative to a fully populated instance of the data object. At the partially populated instance is made available for productive use in the recurring revenue management system. At upon detection of receipt of a second unit of data relating to more fully populate the skeletal instance of the data object additional data are extracted from the second unit of data and added to the skeletal instance which can be kept in productive use.

The additional data can optionally be added to a second instance of the skeletal object and the first and second instances of the skeletal object can be combined into a single instance of the data object using one or more de duplication data conflict resolution and data quality analysis approaches such as for example those discussed above. The first and the second instances of the skeletal object can each include an external identifier string added as annotations to the first and the second instances of the skeletal objects at load time. These external identifier strings can be matched for the first and second instances of the skeletal object which can indicate that the first and the second instances are related for example applicable to completing of a same data object associated with a product covered asset service asset opportunity contact etc.

At based on one or more parameters of the predefined data object and the content of the extracted data one or more relationships are defined between the instance of the predefined data object and at least one other instance of the predefined data object or a second predefined data object of the set of predefined data objects. As an example a relationship can be directly derived from information that exists in the external source. In another example a relationship is inferred or generated based on the extracted data. Inference of a relationship can include applying at least one of applying a transitivity analysis between the instance of the predefined object and two or more other data objects in the asset data model and an automated instantiation of a new inverse relationship based on a direct or inferred existing relationship between the instance and one or more other data objects in the asset data model.

At based at least in part on the one or more relationships an opportunity for sale of a recurring revenue asset is generated. The opportunity can include one or more offers that relate to renewal of one or more service assets associated with asset data objects in the asset data model the one or more service assets can optionally have expiration dates that occur within a current or upcoming sales period. At the generated opportunity is presented to a user.

The extracted content is added at to an instance of the predefined data object and a reference tag is associated with the content extracted from each of the first unit of data and the second unit of data. The reference tag includes identification information for the associated content such as for example one or more of a data source providing the unit of data a time of arrival or creation of the unit of data etc. At a duplicate data condition is detected in which content extracted from the first unit of data and the second unit of data provide redundant conflicting values for a same field within the instance of the predefined data object.

At the duplicate data condition is resolved by applying a predefined approach to conflict resolution based on the identification information contained in the reference tags of the content of the first and second units of data. In some examples the predefined approach can include use of one or more identified key fields appearing in the first unit of data and the second unit of data. The one or more key fields can have a uniqueness property that is known a priori. In another example a clustering algorithm can be applied to identify likely duplication based on one or more measurements of statistical anomaly relative to a larger group of objects in the asset data model.
