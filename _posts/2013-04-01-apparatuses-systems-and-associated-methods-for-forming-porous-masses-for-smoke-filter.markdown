The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 393 378 filed on Oct. 15 2010.

The present invention relates to apparatuses systems and associated methods for producing porous masses that may be used for smoke filters.

The World Health Organization WHO has set forth recommendations for the reduction of certain components of tobacco smoke. See WHO Technical Report Series No. 951 World Health Organization 2008 . Therein the WHO recommends that certain components such as acetaldehyde acrolein benzene benzoapyrene 1 3 butadiene and formaldehyde among others be reduced to a level below 125 of the median values of the data set. Ibid. Table 3.10 page 112. In view of new international recommendations related to tobacco product regulation there is a need for new tobacco smoke filters and materials used to make tobacco smoke filters that are able to meet these regulations.

The draw resistance of other smoking articles e.g. cigarettes is a major determinant of the draw characteristic s of the cigarette which are experienced by a smoker. One measure of draw characteristics is the encapsulated pressure drop. As used herein the term encapsulated pressure drop or EPD refers to the static pressure difference between the two ends of a specimen when it is traversed by an air flow under steady conditions when the volumetric flow is 17.5 ml sec at the output end and when the specimen is completely encapsulated in a measuring device so that no air can pass through the wrapping. EPD has been measured herein under the CORESTA Cooperation Centre for Scientific Research Relative to Tobacco Recommended Method No. 41 dated June 2007. Higher EPD values translate to the smoker having to draw on a smoking device with greater force.

Increasingly governmental regulations require higher filtration efficacies in removing harmful components from tobacco smoke. By way of nonlimiting example the World Health Organization recommends that certain components such as acetaldehyde acrolein benzene benzoapyrene 1 3 butadiene and formaldehyde among others be reduced to a level below 125 of the median values of the data set.

With present cellulose acetate higher filtration efficacies can be achieved by doping with increasing concentrations of particles like activated carbon. However increasing particulate concentration increases the EPD thereby yielding different draw characteristics for smokers. Therefore technologies with higher filtration efficacies with minimal effect on EPD would be of value.

The present invention relates to apparatuses systems and associated methods for producing porous masses that may be used for smoke filters.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a system comprising a material path a mold cavity disposed along the material path at least one hopper operably connected to the material path before at least a portion of the mold cavity and capable of feeding a matrix material to the material path a heat source in thermal communication with at least a first portion of the material path and a cutter disposed along the material path after the first portion of the material path.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a method comprising continuously introducing a matrix material into a mold cavity disposing a release wrapper as a liner of the mold cavity heating at least a portion of the matrix material so as to bind the matrix material at a plurality of contact points thereby forming a porous mass length and cutting the porous mass length radially thereby yielding a porous mass.

In some embodiments the present invention provides a method comprising continuously introducing a matrix material into a mold cavity heating at least a portion of the matrix material so as to bind the matrix material at a plurality of contact points thereby forming a porous mass length and extruding the porous mass length through a die.

To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention the following examples of representative embodiments are given. In no way should the following examples be read to limit or to define the scope of the invention.

Integrity Testing. To measure integrity samples are placed in a French square glass bottle and shaken vigorously using a wrist action shaker for 5 minutes. Upon completion the weight of the samples before and after shaking are compared. The difference is converted to a percent loss value. This test simulates deterioration under extreme circumstances. Less than 2 weight loss is assumed to be acceptable quality.

Porous mass samples were produced with GUR 2105 with carbon additive and GUR X192 with carbon additive were produced both with and without paper wrappings. Said samples were cylinders measuring 8 mm 20 mm. The results of the integrity test are given below in Table 1.

This example demonstrates that increasing the percent of binder GUR in the porous mass and including a wrapper paper enhances the integrity of the porous mass. Further porous masses can be designed to have comparable integrity to a Dalmatian filter plasticized carbon on tow filter which is used for increased removal of smoke components.

Particle Release. To measure the amount of particles released when a fluid is drawn through a filter or porous mass samples are dry puffed and the particles released are collected on a Cambridge pad.

The particle release characteristics of porous masses were compared to a Dalmatian filter plasticized carbon on tow filter . Samples were cylinders measuring 8 mm 20 mm of 1 a porous mass with 333 mg of carbon 2 a porous mass with 338 mg of carbon having been water washed and 3 a Dalmatian filter with 74 mg of carbon. Table 2 below shows the results of the particle release test.

This example demonstrates that porous masses have comparable particle amounts that are released upon drawing as compared to Dalmatian filters even with many times more carbon loading 4.5 times more in this example. Further particle release can be mitigated with porous masses with treatments like washing. Other mitigating steps could be increasing the binder concentration in the porous mass increasing the degree of mechanical binding in the porous mass e.g. by increasing the time at binding temperatures optimizing the size and shape of the additive e.g. carbon and the like.
