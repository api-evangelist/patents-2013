The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.

The present invention relates generally to portable solar energy systems and more specifically to a folding structural deployment system for solar panels.

Solar power systems can be less costly than other types of power sources in more remote areas where power from centralized generators is unavailable. This is particularly true when the cost to continuously transport and store fuel is factored into the situation especially in areas where the climate and topography are conducive to harvesting solar energy.

In rugged remote areas islands regions without roads deserts and the like solar power can be a more desirable source of energy both in terms of reliability and cost. Similarly solar power could also be useful in humanitarian relief efforts and organizations. If reliably available solar power offers opportunities for people in regions which have been affected by partial or total loss of power systems or areas which lack of infrastructure to support power systems. Additional uses for solar power include communication capabilities medical equipment power source and other similar necessities and necessary services.

Many systems that deploy solar arrays for electric power have been fielded. Unfortunately these systems suffer from similar deficiencies including but not limited to less than adequate functionality decreased efficiency and optimization and weight and portability issues. Many are cumbersome to set up and are not suitable for deployment at the best angle relative to the solar orientation of the sun to obtain maximum power yield. These problems may be more pronounced if the power system is to be frequently moved and or require repeated operation of mechanical parts susceptible to damage.

The prior art does not show the features of the present invention which provides for an easily transported rugged folding solar array which overcomes the above mentioned limitations. Accordingly those of skill in the art will appreciate the present invention which addresses the above discussed problems.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved structural deployment system for solar panels.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a containerized solar collecting station that can be easily packaged and deployed for use in diverse environments.

Another object of the invention is a portable solar power collecting system which makes maximum use of deployment angle relative to the sun s solar orientation to garner maximum power yield.

A further object of the invention is to provide rugged external protection from the environment when the solar power system is in storage shipping and use configurations.

In accordance with the present disclosure the present invention provides for a folding structural deployment system for solar panels which may include but is not limited to a container a solar array frame comprising a plurality of pivotally connected struts wherein the solar array frame is movable between a stowed position with the plurality of struts compressed against each other within the container and a deployed position with the plurality of struts being extended with respect to each other. In the deployed position the solar array frame extends outside of the container. A plurality of solar panels are attached to the solar array frame such that the plurality of solar panels are held compactly in a substantially upright or transverse position with respect to the ground within the container when the solar array frame is in the stowed position. The plurality of solar panels is pivotally movable to a more horizontal position with respect to the ground when the solar array frame is in the deployed position.

Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein. It is to be understood however that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system structure or manner.

Turning now to the drawings and more particularly there is shown a side view of one possible embodiment of containerized portable solar power system built into a container which is typically constructed of steel and modified such that solar panels See also and may be housed and deployed in an efficient manner. The container panels such as sides top and end doors protect solar panels from external damage during transportation and storage of system .

In one embodiment hollow elongate openings or tubes define the top edges of container that are oriented from front to back. The tubes can be substantially horizontal or roughly parallel to the Earth as illustrated. For reasons discussed hereinafter hollow frame tubes can be utilized to house extensible and or telescopic beams and when not in use. Container may be hauled by trailer as presently depicted or may stand alone or may be transported by alternate means depending on the application. The internal arrangement of container will be discussed in detail hereinafter in regards to .

In the present embodiment solar array panels are attached to solar array frame . Solar array frame is extendable from container until it reaches its fully deployed position as depicted in . Solar array frame incorporates an accordion style folding mechanism with end pivot points and central pivot points . The pivot points allow struts such as struts and to pivot with respect to each other between a stowed position and a deployed position. In this embodiment pairs of struts as strut pairs and are pivotally connected together at a center position with central pivots . The pairs of struts are also connected at opposite ends with end pivots and . This accordion style pivotal connection arrangement enables the struts to be extended to a deployed state or contracted to a stowed state. In this embodiment the endmost struts are not connected on both ends to other struts as are the remaining struts which make up the majority of struts within solar array frame .

During operation the struts begin in a relatively vertical or upright position with the struts being compressed together and being substantially parallel to each other as shown in . As the struts are moved to an extended position the struts pivot around central pivot points to a relatively horizontal position with each pair of struts being substantially extended end to end as shown in and . Solar panels are mounted to the inner positioned struts as indicated in where strut is an inwardly positioned strut and strut is an outwardly positioned strut. As discussed above struts and are pivotally connected at center pivot .

If the struts are fully extended so that the struts are parallel to each other then solar array frame may be weakened and collapse. However if desired supports may be utilized to support solar array frame to prevent collapse even when extended by this amount. In this way solar panels may be oriented essentially parallel to each other.

However if desired stop devices shown in may be utilized to prevent the struts from becoming parallel with respect to each other whereupon solar array frame may lose strength and bend. In this embodiment stop devices are mounted over end pivots such as pivots with two slots that fit over the pivots whereby movement of these two pivots is stopped or limited especially when array frame is expanded. In other words the slots provide stops the prevent pivots from moving too close together. On the other hand the slots are preferably long enough to allow the struts to fold completely. The stop devices may be longer than shown and in one embodiment are about as long as the struts. In another embodiment stop devices may also act as folding supports or comprise extendable members not shown that engage the ground. As noted above the drawings are not intended to be to scale. Two stop devices may be placed at positions about one third and two thirds along the length of array frame .

Once solar array frame is fully extended by the desired amount solar panels may align or substantially align into one solid rigid array. Handles may be used on the endmost pair of struts or in other positions on solar array frame to assist in moving solar array frame between the stowed and deployed positions. It will be noted that when the array is not fully extended the solar panels may be oriented at an angle to better capture sun radiation that comes from a relatively closer position to the horizon. Extension or retraction of the solar panel therefore may be utilized to perform a certain amount of tracking of the sun if desired.

In one possible embodiment wheels may be mounted to an end of solar array frame to assist in opening and supporting the frame. The wheels may be pivotally mounted at and may if desired comprise connections that snap in place when it is desired to pull the frame out. In one possible embodiment the wheels are sufficiently large to roll over uneven terrain and may be about the size of a typical bicycle wheel about three feet in diameter plus or minus about a foot.

Solar array frame can be supported on the ground or surface around the container by one or more end supports or feet on an end closest to handles . Feet can be designed in a telescoping manner to manually adjust the angle of solar panels to maximize the seasonal orientation of the sun. In another embodiment an active extension retraction system not shown attached to feet either hydraulic or pneumatic may be paired with solar detecting sensors to track the sun and automatically adjust the height of feet . Additional feet or supports to engage the ground may be utilized on other locations on solar array frame and may be separately attached mounted on wheels be adjustable or the like.

Once solar array frame is extended with one or more feet positioned properly relative to the sun then system will garner maximum solar incidence from the sun. Solar array frame allows for proper support of solar panels during operation providing rigidity in the setup and reducing performance degrading curvature in solar panel array .

While feet may be utilized to support solar array frame from beneath the array if desired a variety of telescoping support boom configurations are also possible utilizing container as a base for a support boom to provide supports from above the array. In one embodiment hollow frame tubes and extensible beams act as a deployment and retraction aid for folding structural deployment system for solar panels by producing an upward force on the array. Preferably beams are constructed of carbon fiber or materials having similar properties.

In this embodiment extensible beams are extendable from hollow frame tubes See and attach to solar array frame by way of connectors such as connector . In one embodiment two sets of beams are connected on opposite sides of solar array frame such that beam is tube from which smaller beam telescopically extends. If desired more beams can be utilized or only one beam might be utilized. Connector can be implemented with a variety of fasteners in accord with the present invention. Connector is selected to adequately hold in place solar array frame in relation to extensible beams . Extensible beams bend in a spring like manner with additional stress being required to increase the bend in the beams. Extensible beams produce an upward force as indicated by arrow to counteract the weight of solar array frame as indicated by arrow . Accordingly extensible beams are used as a counter spring to balance the weight of solar array frame allowing deployment of the system to be easily accomplished by 1 or 2 men.

Folding structural deployment system for solar panels allows solar panels mounted on solar array frame to be quickly deployed and stowed without the need to remove mount and electrically interconnect the solar arrays on the ground. The electrical wires to interconnect solar panels are preferably included as part of a wiring harness on solar array frame .

Turning to another embodiment of folding structural deployment system for solar panels is depicted in the fully deployed position. This embodiment comprises a different support mechanism which allows for the system to be operated by only one or two men. As discussed above solar array frame incorporates an accordion style folding structure along pivot points and which allows solar frame to be pulled by handles See and and extend from a back end of container until reaching a fully deployed position. As discussed above end supports or feet may be telescoping and can be used to ensure that solar panel array is oriented to maximize the solar power garnered by the system.

In this embodiment torsion spring or hand crank spool is placed in an upper forward inside corner of container or positioned in another convenient position. Cable runs through hollow frame tubes and extends through extensible tubes and tube exit . Cable may then travel transversely or substantially perpendicular to extensible tubes and connect to solar array frame via connector . As discussed hereinabove in regards to connector could be a variety of removable fasteners including a D clip. As crank retracts and deploys cable extensible tubes will also extend and retract at first tube junction at end of hollow frame tube and at second tube junction segmenting extensible tubes .

Referring now to and folding structural deployment system for solar panels is depicted in the stowed position. In this depiction the sides and top of container are removed for ease of viewing the respective solar array components. In this embodiment each panel of solar panel array is attached to frame by screws . However alternative embodiments may use angle iron brackets to attach panels of solar panel array to solar array frame or solar panel array may be integrated directly into the design of frame .

Solar array frame is supported by solar array frame support base . Support base may comprise or be part of the container floor but could also be separate from the container and mountable within the container onto the container floor. Accordingly the system may be built as a unit and then inserted into or removed from containers as needed.

In one embodiment array frame support base comprises slide bearing which travels between stops and which define the length of array frame support beam . This allows the entire solar array frame to be moved from a central position to the end of the container so that all solar panels even those positioned in the center of the container in the stowed position can be positioned in the sun. Array frame support beam may be attached to array base by suitable fasteners and connectors in accord with the present invention.

In one embodiment two sets of array frames and associated solar panels may be utilized. One set may be deployed out of one side of the container as indicated by arrow A in and another set not shown of array frame and associated solar panels may be deployed out the opposite side of the container as indicated by arrow B.

In one embodiment solar array frame may comprise a spring assembly not shown to assist a user in operating folding structural deployment system for solar panels . This spring assembly may comprise either a torsion spring arrangement or an extension spring arrangement in accord with the present invention. Pulling on handles allows solar array frame to slide on linear bearings outwardly from container until the bearings ultimately stop at endpoint and solar panel array is fully extended outside of container . As frame unfolds in accordion like fashion it will end up with one substantially flat planar surface that can be efficiently oriented with respect to the sun by end supports or feet as described hereinabove with reference to and .

Considerable excess space can be designed into the interior of container . This space may be utilized for related equipment such as batteries wiring switches replacement equipment tools back up fuel generators fuel other equipment and the like which may be necessary for solar power collecting systems in diverse environments.

In the illustrated embodiment of battery charger is operably connected between solar panel array and batteries to ensure maximum battery life for the system. If the container is constructed of a metallic material the metal walls are preferably grounded to a common ground if available. The system when mounted on a truck or the like may comprise a floating ground as commonly used in vehicles.

Although container for trailer is discussed predominantly herein container can be relatively small to reduce the cost for smaller requirements made significantly larger and or be combined in numbers to create readily transportable significant power sources. Notches in base provide means for a forklift to load and unload container from trailers and or other similar commercial transportation vehicles.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
