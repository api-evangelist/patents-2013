title: Automated privacy control
abstract: Systems and approaches are provided for automating privacy control for a computing device based on a privacy or security context of the device. The privacy or security context of the computing device can be determined by analyzing sensor data or other input data captured by the device. The sensor and other input data can provide information such as a location of the computing device or the presence of other persons within the vicinity of the device to indicate whether the user is situated within a private or secure setting or a public or unsecure setting. A privacy or security control can be updated based on the determined privacy or security context, such as modifying a manner of displaying a pin or password during entry, elements of a home screen of the computing device, or preview content of user applications.

As personal computing devices such as laptop computers tablets smartphones or head mounted displays and other wearable computing devices e.g. eyeglasses visors gloves watches wristbands etc. become more sophisticated users are able to interact with such devices in new and interesting ways. For example a user may operate a personal computing device to review email text messages or instant messages perform transactions via bank credit card and other financial accounts or create and edit word processing spreadsheet and presentation documents. The data associated with such tasks can often be highly sensitive and or confidential and securing the data is increasingly important for many personal computing device users. Although the portability and flexibility of personal computing devices are characteristics that are valued by users such features can also leave sensitive and or confidential information more vulnerable to exposure by users misplacing their devices or inadvertently revealing the information to others while operating the devices in public or unsecure settings. To secure personal computing devices a one size fits all approach is often taken that typically requires users to enter a pin or password to unlock devices and an additional pin or password entry for access to certain user applications and or certain data accessible from the devices. In some situations such as when a user is at home or in the office requiring multiple pin or password entries can seem onerous when the user is in a private or secure environment. In other situations pin or password entry may not provide sufficient privacy or security for certain kinds of data.

Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of the aforementioned and other deficiencies experienced in conventional approaches for providing privacy or security for a personal computing device. In particular various embodiments can determine a privacy or security context in which a user and her computing device is situated and configure a privacy or security control based on the privacy or security context and or the nature of the data the user is attempting to access on the computing device. A personal computing device can operate according to multiple privacy or security contexts that are adaptive to the user s environment and or the sensitivity of the data being accessed on the device. For example when a user attempts to access the device or certain data accessible from the device at home or another private or secure setting the device can be configured to display a pin or password to the user in order to ease entry of the pin or password or the device may enable immediate access to the device user applications or data without pin or password entry altogether in certain instances. When the user attempts to access the device or certain data accessible from the device at a public or unsecure setting the device can obscure the pin or password during entry by displaying an asterisk for each key entered into the device. In some embodiments a user may categorize some data as requiring additional privacy or security control and access to such data may be enabled using a different privacy or security authentication approach such as techniques based on biometrics e.g. facial recognition fingerprint scanning or retinal scanning behaviometrics e.g. voice or gait recognition and or other privacy or security approaches.

In various embodiments data captured by one or more sensors input devices and other inputs of a computing device can be analyzed to determine the privacy or security context of the environment in which the device is located and a confidence level associated with the determined privacy or security context. The privacy or security context can be represented as a binary state e.g. public or private multiple states e.g. personally private confidential business highly confidential business etc. a range of states e.g. public semi public private maximally secure etc. or other such designations. The privacy or security context indicates an extent to which the environment in which the computing device is situated is private secure or not. In some embodiments a user s home office or other location may generally be determined to be a private or secure environment. This can be based on explicit user configuration bright line rules or heuristics or past user behavior of a specific user or a community of users. For example a user s recurring access of sensitive data at a particular place can indicate that the location is private or secure. In some embodiments the computing device can prompt the user whether to configure a current location as a private or secure environment when the user accesses confidential or sensitive at that location a specified number of times. Henceforth that location may be determined to correspond to a private or secure setting if the user selects the location to be a private or secure location for the user. However certain conditions as determined by a device s sensors or other inputs can affect that determination. For instance the presence of persons other than the device s owner within the vicinity of the device such as detected by a camera or a microphone may change the determined privacy or security context of the device from private secure to a less private secure state in some situations. The confidence level can be used to quantify an extent of certainty of the determined privacy or security context and can be based on input device sensitivity accuracy or specificity an error rate associated with the sensor or input receiver operating characteristic ROC of the sensor or input and other such metrics. For example when a global positioning system GPS receiver of a computing device indicates that the user is located at a park the environmental state associated with this location may be public with a high level of confidence such as 100 in a numeric range of 0 to 100 for the determined privacy or security context. In another situation the GPS receiver may indicate that the user is located proximate to the user s home such that the privacy or security context is determined to be private but not directly inside the user s home e.g. front yard or backyard . The GPS receiver however may only be accurate up to a dozen meters and a lower confidence level such as 50 may be associated with the determined privacy or security context because of the uncertainty of whether the user is inside or outside of her home.

In various embodiments data from multiple sensors of the computing device or other inputs can be selected and or aggregated to obtain a more accurate and or detailed understanding of the privacy or security context of the environment in which the device can be found. In some embodiments a determination by one sensor input device or other input can be selected from multiple inputs to determine a final privacy or security context. Selection may be based on a particular input being associated with a highest confidence level or lowest error rate. In other embodiments the data captured by multiple sensors or other inputs can be combined by weighting each input based on various factors such as an extent to which data from a particular sensor or input can be relied upon to determine the privacy or security context of a device. For instance in one embodiment a microphone can be used to capture ambient noise to analyze whether there are other persons within the vicinity of the device. Ambient noise revealing that other persons are speaking close to the device may be a strong indicator that the device is within a public setting and lack of ambient noise may lean slightly in favor of the device being designated as within a private setting. The device may also include a GPS receiver that can be used to determine the privacy or security context of the device. An approach relying on geolocation data for determining an privacy or security context of a device may be more reliable than an approach based on ambient noise and the approach using GPS or geolocation can be weighted more strongly than the approach determined using a microphone or ambient noise. In still other embodiments only a selection of the sensors and other inputs can be aggregated to arrive at the final determined privacy or security context of the device.

In various embodiments privacy and security controls can be updated based on a determined privacy or security context of a computing device. For example a period of time of inactivity that triggers a screen lock or screen saver may vary according to the privacy or security context of the device certain data e.g. applications documents photographs media files preview content etc. may be displayed or hidden based on the determined privacy or security context and or user interfaces may be modified according to the privacy or security context of the device.

Various other functions and advantages are described and suggested below in accordance with the various embodiments.

In the example situation the computing device has been locked because of a period of inactivity when the user attempts to access the device. The device includes one or more additional sensors other input devices or other inputs not shown that are used to determine the current location of the device such as a GPS receiver a cellular phone network component a near field communications NFC component other short range beacon systems based on Wi Fi radio frequency RF infra red IR Bluetooth and other such approaches known to those of ordinary skill in the art for determining location. In certain embodiments image data can be captured using a camera of a device and the captured image data can be matched against an image database to recognize a user s current specific location or a type of location of the user s current location. For example the device or the device in communication with another system may analyze the captured image data and recognize that the user is located at a grocery store based on a plurality of stock shelves within the captured image data. Further when captured image data includes textual information such as a street or building sign the textual information can be recognized using one or more optical character recognition OCR engines and the recognized textual information can be used to determine the location. In this example the location of the device is determined to be a public setting such as away from a user s home office or other secure environment or a location that may include persons other than the user within the vicinity of the device. Based on the determination of a public setting and the user s attempt to unlock the device the device prompts the user to enter a pin or password via a virtual keyboard presented on the touchscreen before the user can access the device operating system and user applications. As the user enters the pin or password each key of the pin or password is obscured from view of potential passersby by replacing the key with an asterisk. In other embodiments a most recently entered key may be displayed for a brief period of time to assist the user with pin or password entry before being obscured by an asterisk.

Although a pin or password entry is disclosed as one approach for securing a personal computing device it will be appreciated that other privacy or security techniques can be used to secure a device in various other embodiments. For example in one embodiment a device may include one or more inertial sensors such as an accelerometer gyroscope inclinometer or magnetometer which can be used to detect a particular series of device motions e.g. panning tilting dollying in dollying out to unlock the device and or enable access to certain data accessible from the device. In another embodiment a device may include one or more cameras that can be used to detect various user gestures e.g. eye winks lip movements head movements finger or hand gestures etc. . In another embodiment biometric characteristics e.g. facial recognition retinal or fingerprint scanning or behaviometric characteristics e.g. written signature can be measured and used to unlock the device and or enable access to certain data accessible from the device. As used herein biometrics refers to approaches that measure and analyze biological characteristics of a user for authentication purposes while behaviometrics refers to approaches that measure and analyze how a user behaves to identify a specific user. For example biometric techniques may capture fingerprint retinal or DNA data to identify a specific user while behaviometric techniques can be used to identify a user by the way she signs her name how she pronounces or mispronounces words of a non native language or the way she walks and or runs. In yet another embodiment a device may include one or more touch or pressure sensors that can be used to detect one or more touch or squeeze gestures to unlock the device and or enable access to certain data accessible from the device. It will be appreciated to those of ordinary skill in the art that a pin or password entry via a virtual keyboard is a specific instance of an approach based on touch gestures and that other embodiments may employ a privacy or security control based on other types of touch or squeeze gestures e.g. user signature via a pointer such as user s finger stylus or similar implement . In other embodiments spoken words phrases or other sounds captured using one or more microphones can be used to unlock the device and or enable access to certain data accessible from the device. As mentioned in still other embodiments users can obtain immediate access to a device or certain data accessible from the device without any authentication when the device is determined to be located at a private or secure environment.

Systems and approaches in accordance with various embodiments are able to determine a privacy or security context of a computing device using various sensors or other input mechanisms of the device and configuring a privacy or security control based on the determined privacy or security context. In various embodiments a computing device may include one or more cameras microphones GPS receivers cellular network transceivers Wi Fi transceivers Bluetooth devices RF transceivers NFC devices proximity sensors distance sensors depth sensors ambient light sensors barometers altimeters accelerometers magnetometers gyroscopes inclinometers thermal sensors touch sensors pressure sensors optical sensors infra red transceivers laser transceivers ultrasonic transceivers and or other sensors transceivers and mechanisms that can be used to determine the user s environment and or whether other persons other than the user are within the vicinity of the device.

The computing device also includes one or more microphones or other audio capture devices capable of capturing audio data such as words spoken by a user of the device or ambient sound in the vicinity of the device. In this example the microphone is placed on the same side of the device as the display screen such that the microphone will typically be better able to capture words spoken by a user of the device. In at least some embodiments the microphone can be a directional microphone that captures sound information from substantially directly in front of the device and picks up only a limited amount of sound from other directions which can help to better capture words spoken by a primary user of the device. In other embodiments a computing device may include multiple microphones to capture 3D audio. In at least some embodiments a computing device can also include an audio output element such as internal speakers or one or more ports to support peripheral audio output devices such as headphones or loudspeakers.

In this example a user of the computing device can be seen attempting to operate the computing device within the vicinity of persons and having no relation to user . Upon attempting to access the device the device may capture input data from the plurality of input mechanisms of the device to determine the privacy or security context of the device s environment in order to apply appropriate privacy or security controls. A GPS receiver not shown of the device can determine GPS coordinates corresponding to the location at which the device is located and the device can request a reverse geocoding from a remote mapping service to retrieve a geographical address or similar location data for the device. In this example the geographical address at which the device is located is determined to be an outdoor caf frequented by the user . The device may also capture image data using the front facing camera to determine the number of persons represented within the image data such as by facial recognition pupil recognition or similar processes. For example persons within the field of view of the camera are likely to be capable of viewing content displayed on the touchscreen . The presence of multiple persons may be a strong indicator that the device is located within a public or unsecure setting. In this example a facial recognition process is used to analyze the captured image data and identifies the presence of multiple persons user and another person . As mentioned in at least some embodiments a device may be capable of recognizing the specific user of the device based on facial recognition or retinal scanning and the privacy or security context of the device can be further based on such analysis. For instance a person other than a user of a device represented within captured image data may strongly imply that the device is located within a public or unsecure setting.

The computing device can also capture audio data using the microphone and analyze the audio data to determine the privacy or security context of the device. For example a voice recognition process can be used to determine the number of persons represented within the audio data. Multiple persons speaking may suggest a public setting and lack of ambient noise may suggest that the current environment of the device is more likely to be a private setting. In this example little to no ambient noise is captured by the microphone . The computing device further includes an ambient light sensor ALS not shown that can also be utilized for determining the privacy or security context of the computing device. For instance the amount of ambient light detected by the ALS in combination with a time between sunrise and sunset can determine whether the user is likely to be indoors which may correspond to the privacy or security context that is more likely to be a private setting or outdoors which may correspond to the privacy or security context that is more likely to be a public setting.

In various embodiments sensor data or other input data can be aggregated to determine a privacy or security context of a computing device. In one embodiment respective data from each of a plurality of sensors or other input mechanisms can be analyzed to determine a preliminary score indicative of a privacy or security context according to a sensor or input mechanism. Each preliminary score may be weighted according to factors such as sensor or input mechanism accuracy an extent to which a sensor or input may be a more reliable indicator of the privacy or security context of the device environmental conditions affecting the sensor or input an amount of historical user data for a specific user of a device and or a community of users accumulated for a sensor or input and other such considerations. In some embodiments one of the preliminary scores can be selected to be the final determined privacy or security context of the environment in which the user and or computing device is situated. In other embodiments the preliminary scores can be aggregated to determine a composite score representing the privacy or security context and a confidence level of the determined privacy or security context. An example of an approach for determining a privacy or security context of a computing device is provided in Table 1.

In Table 1 the first column represents each of the sensors or inputs used by a computing device to determine the privacy or security context of the device. In this example the ALS Daytime Clear Day ALS Daytime Cloudy Day and ALS Nighttime inputs are mutually exclusive. That is only one of these inputs will be evaluated to determine the final or composite privacy or security context as only one of these time and weather conditions will be applicable. The second column represents the weight w each sensor or input of the computing device should be afforded in determining the privacy or security context of the computing device. Weighting here is based on the efficacy of each input approach in determining the privacy or security context for a particular user although various other weighting schemes can be used and which are discussed elsewhere herein. In this example each of the ALS inputs is also designated different weights because the accuracy and or reliability of the ALS may depend on cloud conditions and or time of day. The ALS sensor may not be capable of providing relevant data after sunset such that the weight of ALS Nighttime is 0.0. Further the ALS may be less accurate under conditions less than full sunlight such that the weight on a cloudy day is 0.2 while the weight on a clear day is 0.3. The third column represents the maximum weighted score sof each sensor or input i.e. s w 100 . The fifth column represents the preliminary privacy or security context c as determined individually by each sensor or input. In this example privacy or security context c is quantified as 1 for a public setting and 1 for a private setting. The fourth column represents the score or confidence level s of the privacy or security context determined by each input approach. The sixth column represents the weighted score sfor each sensor or input and can be determined by 

In this example scores can range from 0 lowest level of confidence to 100 highest level of confidence .

Returning to example situation the GPS receiver of computing device and the reverse geocoding determined that the user was located at an outdoor caf . In one embodiment locations such as the user s home or office can be specified as a private or secure setting and can be scored . In other embodiments a location can correspond to a private or secure environment based on historical user behavior such as whether the user or similar users have accessed sensitive data at the location on a recurring basis. In this example although a caf is generally a public setting the user and or a community of other users may have previously accessed confidential data at the caf such that the privacy or security context as determined by the GPS receiver is a public setting but with a score of 60 out of 100 to reflect the ambiguity of whether the caf is a private or public setting. As mentioned the confidence level or scoring can also be affected by the sensitivity accuracy or specificity of a sensor input mechanism or other input data the error rate of the sensor or input ROC curves of the sensor or input and other such factors. In this example the image data captured by the camera indicates the presence of multiple persons represented in the image data such that the privacy or security context of the device as determined by the camera is a public setting. Although the presence of multiple persons is a strong indication that the device is located within a public setting there may be false positives such as when a single user is located in front of a framed picture or the process used to detect the number of persons represented in the captured image data has been established to be accurate only to a certain degree. Thus the score for the privacy or security context as determined by the camera is 80 out of 100. In some embodiments the score can be based on a bright line rule that detection of multiple users in image data will always return such a score. In other embodiments the score alternatively or additionally may be affected by an error rate ROC curves and other such measurements associated with the facial detection person detection or object detection algorithm used to determine the presence of persons in image data.

In this example the device has also retrieved cloud conditions from a remote weather service and determined that it is a clear day. The ALS of the device captures an amount of ambient light at the user s current location and the device determines that the privacy or security context is a public setting based on the amount of ambient light detected as compared to the expected outdoor ambient light. As known by those of ordinary skill in the art indoor lighting can have specular characteristics similar to sunlight. Further whether a user is indoors or outdoors is not a strong predictor that a particular environment is sufficiently secure. Thus the score for the privacy or security context as determined by the ALS is 50 out of 100. Again this can be a bright line rule or heuristic because mining behavior data of the specific user or a collection of users with similar demographic traits has shown such an approach to be reliable only half the time in determining a privacy or security context for a device. Further as in this example the score for one input can also depend on other input data. For example the score associated with the ALS is based on the weather conditions derived from a remote weather service. The score for the ALS additionally or alternatively may also be affected by a probability rate associated with the weather conditions provided by the weather service the error rate accuracy specificity ROC curves etc. of the ALS.

Table 1 includes a Total Score S which represents the sum of the weighted scores sfor each of the sensors or inputs of the device. Weights can be distributed in various ways. In this example weights have been distributed according to an established efficacy or accuracy of an input approach in determining a privacy or security context of a computing device for a particular user. In other embodiments weighting may also be based on user behavior data provided by multiple users. In various embodiments weighting may also or alternatively be based on the determined confidence level of each input approach the established accuracy of each approach location specific input data and or other weighting schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples of location based weighting include weighting certain input approaches based on a determined location of a user and or computing device. For instance the user may be at a location that typically has little ambient noise such as a library or place of worship. In such situations determination of a security or privacy context by microphones may be weighted less than other approaches. As another example an environmental state of the computing device can also be used for weighting the various input approaches used to determine the privacy or security context of the device. When a user is outdoors time of day and or weather conditions may affect the weighting of a determination of the privacy or security context by an ALS such as sunny conditions during daylight hours corresponding to a greater weight or cloudy conditions and or night time hours corresponding to less weight for the ALS. Further when a user is indoors an approach based on ALS may be weighted less than other input approaches. Other examples can include input data from a geocoding service mapping service calendar event scheduling application and other services and applications.

In this example a positive Total Environmental Score S indicates a private setting and a negative Total Environmental Score S indicates a public setting. Here the Total Environmental Score S is 61 suggesting that the device is located within a public setting. Table 1 further includes a Total Max Weighted Score S which is the sum of the maximum weighted scores sof each of the sensors or inputs of the device. The Total Max Weighted Score Scan be used to calculate the confidence level of the determined privacy or security context which is the percentage of the weighted scores compared to the maximum weighted scores 

It will be appreciated that privacy context matrix of Table 1 is but one approach for aggregating data from multiple sensors or other inputs to determine a privacy or security context of a computing device. It should also be understand that the weights maximum weighted scores scores privacy or security contexts and weighted scores are provided for explanatory purposes and the invention disclosed herein is not limited to these particular values. In various embodiments different weighting schemes scores etc. may be used or not used including rule based approaches classification based approaches or estimation based approaches. Rule based approaches can include a variety of basic rules such as a sum rule a product rule a maximum rule a minimum rule a mean rule a median rule a majority voting among others. In the example of Table 1 a sum rule is used to determine the privacy or security context. A product rule would multiply the scores of each input approach. The sum and product rules can also be weighted as in the approach set forth in Table 1. In the maximum rule a determination of a privacy or security context by a single input approach is selected as a final privacy or a security context. The maximum rule can be based on the input approach determined to have the highest confidence level. In the minimum rule the determination of a single input approach is selected based on a minimum determinant such as the input approach having the lowest error rate. The mean and median rules take an average of the input approaches and can use various weighting schemes as discussed throughout herein. The majority voting rule provides a vote to each input approach and the majority of the votes is used to determine the final privacy or security context. Majority voting approaches can also use weighting schemes to emphasize or de emphasize certain input approaches. In some embodiments determination of a privacy or security context is treated as a classification problem. Classification approaches can be based on support vector machines Bayesian inference Dempster Shafer theory hidden Markov models neural networks and maximum entropy models. Estimation based approaches can include the Kalman filter or its variants such as the extended Kalman filter or the unscented Kalman filter and the particle filter. Such approaches are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and will not be discussed herein in detail. Further as mentioned other embodiments may recognize a range of privacy or security contexts. For example in one embodiment there may be 5 privacy or security contexts and individual scores of sensors and inputs can correspond to one of the five contexts. The individual scores can be weighted according to some of the considerations discussed herein and a total score can be calculated from the individual scores. A total score between 0 20 may correspond to the first privacy or security context a total score between 21 40 may correspond to the second context a total score between 41 60 may correspond to the third context a total score between 61 80 may correspond to the fourth context and a total score between 81 100 may correspond to the fifth context. In other embodiments weights and individual scoring of sensors and other inputs may be dynamic and can change based on user behavior including both a specific user of a computing device and a community of users such as users sharing similar demographic traits or living in close proximity to the specific user. It will be appreciated that other scoring schemes can be utilized by various embodiments as should be apparent in light of the teachings and suggestions contained herein. In at least some embodiments a device may enable a user to configure or specify the number and types of privacy or security context capable of being determined by the computing device locations associated with certain contexts the sensors or other input used to determine the environmental state weighting and the security or privacy controls corresponding to certain contexts.

In addition to obtaining data from a remote weather service the computing device may also obtain other inputs to facilitate determination of the privacy or security context of the device such as reverse geocoding information from a mapping service location information from an image based and or text based search engine or location information from a reverse Internet Protocol IP lookup service. In some embodiments the privacy or security context of the device can be determined in part by the cellular network tower or Wi Fi connection accessed by the device. For example the device being connected to a home or business Wi Fi connection may be a strong indication that the device is situated in a private or secure setting and the device being connected to a public Wi Fi connection would suggest that the user is within a public or unsecure setting. In one embodiment the configuration of a Wi Fi connection can also include an option to designate the device as located within a private setting when the device is connected to that Wi Fi connection. However it will be appreciated that being connected to the Wi Fi connection may not be dispositive of the privacy or security context as visitors may be present at the user s home or office. The other sensors and inputs of the device may provide a more robust determination of the privacy or security context. In some embodiments the privacy or security context of the device can also be determined in part by the NFC RF IR or Bluetooth components of the device. For instance a device may be configured to connect to a user s vehicle via Bluetooth and the device being connected to the user s vehicle may be a strong indication that the user is within a private setting. In one embodiment the configuration of a Bluetooth connection may include an option to designate the device as located within a private setting when the device is connected to that Bluetooth connection.

In some embodiments a screen lock of a device can be modified based on the determined privacy or security context. Conventional devices typically trigger a screen lock after a period of inactivity and require the user to enter a pin or password to re obtain access to the operating system of the device. In one embodiment the period of time of inactivity to trigger the screen lock can be greater when the device is determined to be within a private or secure setting than when the device is determined to be within a public or unsecure setting. In another embodiment the screen lock can be eschewed altogether when the device is determined to be located within a private setting.

In some embodiments a home screen of the computing device can be modified based on the determined privacy or security context of the device. In one embodiment when the device is determined to be in a public setting certain user applications bookmarks or files e.g. documents photographs media files etc. accessible from the home screen can be hidden. When the device is determined to be within a private setting those applications bookmarks or files can be displayed. In another embodiment the device can be configured to display a different background photograph or image according to the privacy or security context. For example a personal photograph can be displayed as the background of the home screen when the device is located within a private setting and a different image can be displayed as the background of the home screen when the device is located within a public setting.

In various embodiments user applications can also implement appropriate privacy or security controls based on the determined privacy or security context of the device. A device can include an application programming interface API that exposes the determined privacy or security context to user applications and the user applications can modify user experiences according to the determined privacy or security context. For example email applications typically display a portion of an email message to assist the user in quickly assessing whether to review the entire message. While such an approach can enhance the user experience sensitive and or confidential information can also be inadvertently exposed if the user opens the email application in a public setting. Thus the email application can be configured to withhold or hide the message content the subject line and or the sender when the device is determined to be in a public setting. It will be appreciated that in those embodiments with multiple privacy or security contexts more or less information can be presented based on the determined context. For example in one embodiment with multiple privacy contexts all preview content of an email can be displayed for the most secure context the sender and subject line can be displayed in a less secure context and only the sender may be displayed in an even less secure context. A similar approach of eliding preview content can also be implemented by text messaging instant messaging visual voicemail and social networking applications. As another example the email application may include email from multiple accounts including personal and business email accounts. The email application can default to a particular designated email account based on the privacy or security context such as a personal account when the device is determined to be in a public setting and a business account when the device is determined to be in a private setting. Open email messages for sensitive and or confidential email accounts can also be automatically closed when the device is determined to be situated in a public setting.

The computing device includes at least one capacitive component or other proximity sensor which can be part of or separate from the display assembly. In at least some embodiments the proximity sensor can take the form of a capacitive touch sensor capable of detecting the proximity of a finger or other such object as discussed herein. The computing device also includes various power components known in the art for providing power to a computing device which can include capacitive charging elements for use with a power pad or similar device. The computing device can include one or more communication elements or networking sub systems such as a Wi Fi Bluetooth RF wired or wireless communication system. The device in many embodiments can communicate with a network such as the Internet and may be able to communicate with other such devices. In some embodiments the device can include at least one additional input device able to receive conventional input from a user. This conventional input can include for example a push button touch pad touchscreen wheel joystick keyboard mouse keypad or any other such device or element whereby a user can input a command to the device. In some embodiments however such a device might not include any buttons at all and might be controlled only through a combination of visual and audio commands such that a user can control the device without having to be in contact with the device.

The device also can include one or more orientation and or motion sensors . Such sensor s can include an accelerometer or gyroscope operable to detect an orientation and or change in orientation or an electronic or digital compass which can indicate a direction in which the device is determined to be facing. The mechanism s also or alternatively can include or comprise a global positioning system GPS or similar positioning element operable to determine relative coordinates for a position of the computing device as well as information about relatively large movements of the device. The device can include other elements as well such as may enable location determinations through triangulation or another such approach. These mechanisms can communicate with the processor whereby the device can perform any of a number of actions described or suggested herein.

In some embodiments the device can include the ability to activate and or deactivate detection and or command modes such as when receiving a command from a user or an application or retrying to determine an audio input or video input etc. For example a device might not attempt to detect or communicate with devices when there is not a user in the room. If a proximity sensor of the device such as an IR sensor detects a user entering the room for instance the device can activate a detection or control mode such that the device can be ready when needed by the user but conserve power and resources when a user is not nearby.

In some embodiments the computing device may include a ambient light sensor that is able to determine whether the device is exposed to ambient light or is in relative or complete darkness. Such an element can be beneficial in a number of ways. For example the light detecting element can be used to determine when a user is holding the device up to the user s face causing the light detecting element to be substantially shielded from the ambient light which can trigger an action such as the display element to temporarily shut off since the user cannot see the display element while holding the device to the user s ear . The light detecting element could be used in conjunction with information from other elements to adjust the functionality of the device. For example if the device is unable to detect a user s view location and a user is not holding the device but the device is exposed to ambient light the device might determine that it has likely been set down by the user and might turn off the display element and disable certain functionality. If the device is unable to detect a user s view location a user is not holding the device and the device is further not exposed to ambient light the device might determine that the device has been placed in a bag or other compartment that is likely inaccessible to the user and thus might turn off or disable additional features that might otherwise have been available. In some embodiments a user must either be looking at the device holding the device or have the device out in the light in order to activate certain functionality of the device. In other embodiments the device may include a display element that can operate in different modes such as reflective for bright situations and emissive for dark situations . Based on the detected light the device may change modes.

In some embodiments the device can disable features for reasons substantially unrelated to power savings. For example the device can use voice recognition to determine people near the device such as children and can disable or enable features such as Internet access or parental controls based thereon. Further the device can analyze recorded noise to attempt to determine an environment such as whether the device is in a car or on a plane and that determination can help to decide which features to enable disable or which actions are taken based upon other inputs. If speech or voice recognition is used words can be used as input either directly spoken to the device or indirectly as picked up through conversation. For example if the device determines that it is in a car facing the user and detects a word such as hungry or eat then the device might turn on the display element and display information for nearby restaurants etc. A user can have the option of turning off voice recording and conversation monitoring for privacy and other such purposes.

In some of the above examples the actions taken by the device relate to deactivating certain functionality for purposes of reducing power consumption. It should be understood however that actions can correspond to other functions that can adjust similar and other potential issues with use of the device. For example certain functions such as requesting Web page content searching for content on a hard drive and opening various applications can take a certain amount of time to complete. For devices with limited resources or that have heavy usage a number of such operations occurring at the same time can cause the device to slow down or even lock up which can lead to inefficiencies degrade the user experience and potentially use more power. In order to address at least some of these and other such issues approaches in accordance with various embodiments can also utilize information such as user gaze direction to activate resources that are likely to be used in order to spread out the need for processing capacity memory space and other such resources.

In some embodiments the device can have sufficient processing capability and the camera and associated image analysis algorithm s may be sensitive enough to distinguish between the motion of the device motion of a user s head motion of the user s eyes and other such motions based on the captured images alone. In other embodiments such as where it may be desirable for an image process to utilize a fairly simple camera and image analysis approach it can be desirable to include at least one orientation determining element that is able to determine a current orientation of the device. In one example the one or more orientation and or motion sensors may comprise a single or multi axis accelerometer that is able to detect factors such as three dimensional position of the device and the magnitude and direction of movement of the device as well as vibration shock etc. Methods for using elements such as accelerometers to determine orientation or movement of a device are also known in the art and will not be discussed herein in detail. Other elements for detecting orientation and or movement can be used as well within the scope of various embodiments for use as the orientation determining element. When the input from an accelerometer or similar element is used along with the input from the camera the relative movement can be more accurately interpreted allowing for a more precise input and or a less complex image analysis algorithm.

When using a camera of the computing device to detect motion of the device and or user for example the computing device can use the background in the images to determine movement. For example if a user holds the device at a fixed orientation e.g. distance angle etc. to the user and the user changes orientation to the surrounding environment analyzing an image of the user alone will not result in detecting a change in an orientation of the device. Rather in some embodiments the computing device can still detect movement of the device by recognizing the changes in the background imagery behind the user. So for example if an object e.g. a window picture tree bush building car etc. moves to the left or right in the image the device can determine that the device has changed orientation even though the orientation of the device with respect to the user has not changed. In other embodiments the device may detect that the user has moved with respect to the device and adjust accordingly. For example if the user tilts their head to the left or right with respect to the device the content rendered on the display element may likewise tilt to keep the content in orientation with the user.

As discussed different approaches can be implemented in various environments in accordance with the described embodiments. For example illustrates an example of an environment for implementing aspects in accordance with various embodiments. As will be appreciated although a Web based environment is used for purposes of explanation different environments may be used as appropriate to implement various embodiments. The system includes an electronic client device which can include any appropriate device operable to send and receive requests messages or information over an appropriate network and convey information back to a user of the device. Examples of such client devices include personal computers cell phones handheld messaging devices laptop computers set top boxes personal data assistants electronic book readers and the like. The network can include any appropriate network including an intranet the Internet a cellular network a local area network or any other such network or combination thereof. Components used for such a system can depend at least in part upon the type of network and or environment selected. Protocols and components for communicating via such a network are well known and will not be discussed herein in detail. Communication over the network can be enabled via wired or wireless connections and combinations thereof. In this example the network includes the Internet as the environment includes a Web server for receiving requests and serving content in response thereto although for other networks an alternative device serving a similar purpose could be used as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device and handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HTML XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the Web server . It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing content e.g. production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store is also shown to include a mechanism for storing log or session data . It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as page image information and access rights information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information can then be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.

Each server typically will include an operating system that provides executable program instructions for the general administration and operation of that server and typically will include computer readable medium storing instructions that when executed by a processor of the server allow the server to perform its intended functions.
