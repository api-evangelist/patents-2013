The field of the invention is data processing or more specifically methods systems and products for intermediate message invalidation useful in workflow decision management.

Conventional networks contain various networked devices. User s often use the various devices or adjust particular settings of the devices in accordance with consistent patterns and scenarios of device usage. Despite routinely using devices according to these consistent patterns and scenarios of device usage conventional networked devices still often require user intervention to change attribute values of a device. It would be advantageous if there were a method of workflow decision management that used workflows to change in values of device attributes in a network in dependence upon identified patterns of usage and identified scenarios that did not require user intervention.

Methods systems and products are provided for workflow decision management. Embodiments include maintaining a device state history identifying a plurality of device usage patterns in dependence upon the device state history identifying a plurality of workflow scenarios in dependence upon the device usage patterns determining a workflow administration capacity in dependence upon the plurality of workflow scenarios identifying a plurality of workflows in dependence upon the workflow scenario executing the plurality of workflows in dependence upon the workflow administration capacity.

Determining a workflow administration capacity in dependence upon the plurality of workflow scenarios may be carried out by determining whether the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios conflict and augmenting one or more of the plurality of workflows if the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios conflict.

Determining a workflow administration capacity in dependence upon the plurality of workflow scenarios may be carried out by identifying a plurality of devices administered by the plurality of workflow scenarios identifying an associated tolerance for each the workflow scenario retrieving individual device capacities for the identified devices and identifying an administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices in dependence upon the associated tolerances for the workflows and the individual device capacities. Identifying a workflow administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices may include selecting a workflow administration capacity record in dependence upon the identified device capacities the associated tolerances and workflow scenarios. Identifying a workflow administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices may include dynamically determining for an administration capacity record in dependence upon the identified device capacities the associated tolerances the workflow scenarios and a dynamic administration rule.

 Bluetooth refers to an industrial specification for a short range radio technology for RF couplings among client devices and between client devices and resources on a LAN or other network. An administrative body called the Bluetooth Special Interest Group tests and qualifies devices as Bluetooth compliant. The Bluetooth specification consists of a Foundation Core which provides design specifications and a Foundation Profile which provides interoperability guidelines.

 CEBus is an abbreviation for Consumer Electronics Bus. CEBus is an open international standard for controlling devices over different media such as power line radio frequency RF infrared IR coaxial cable twisted pair fiber optics and audio video. The CEBus standard is promulgated by the Consumer Electronic Manufacturers Association CEMA a sector of the Electronics Industries Association EIA and described in 12 standards the ANSI EIA 600 series. The CEBus standard describes a physical design and topology of network media a protocol for message generation and a common application language CAL . The CEBus specification is available for download at http www.cebus.org.

CEBus provides a Common Application Language CAL defined in EIA 600.81 that uses an object oriented model to provide interoperability between diverse devices in a networked environment. The CAL specification defines a set of classes that provide an interface to the internal operations of these disparate networked devices. If a function or feature cannot be mapped well to one of the classes defined in the CAL specification the CAL specification has set aside a specific range of class identifiers for defining special classes.

CAL objects have two important attributes Instance Variables and Methods. Instance Variables contain information about a particular CAL object such as Boolean indications numeric information character string information and other data. Boolean Instance Variables can only be set to TRUE or FALSE. As the name implies numeric Instance Variables are intended for storage of numbers. The character string type Instance Variables provide storage of text. And other data type Instance Variables provide storage of other information as a single dimensioned array of one or more elements each element containing the same number of one or more bytes.

Access to the information contained in CAL Instance Variables is accomplished through a set of member methods specific to that object. Examples of common methods include setOn setOff setValue getValue setArray and getArray. Not all methods are appropriate for each Instance Variable type. For example a setOn method is intended for manipulating Boolean Instance Variables and is therefore undefined for an Instance Variable of the character string type.

Entries in the dead message queue include a dead message queue ID uniquely identifying the dead message queue and a message ID uniquely identifying the invalid message represented by an entry in the log. Entries in the dead message queue include the contents of the message and the time message was sent .

In the method of maintaining a device state history includes recording a plurality of attribute values for a device . In the example of each time an attribute value of a device is changed the change is recorded by creating a new entry in a device state history. In some such embodiments the latest entry in the device state history represents the current state of the device. In some embodiments workflow decision management devices are configured to report to application programming implementing a device state manager with each change in an attribute value and the device state manager creates a new entry in a device state history recording the change in attribute value.

The method of also includes identifying an identified device usage pattern in dependence upon the device state history . As discussed above a device usage record represents a predetermined pattern of device usage and includes a collection of device attribute values defining the device usage pattern. In the method of identifying an identified device usage pattern in dependence upon the device state history further comprises comparing the device state history with a plurality of device usage patterns records . In the example of a window of the entries of the device state history representing recent device states are compared with device usage records in a device usage pattern database to identify a matching device usage record . If such a matching device usage record exists then it is inferred that the current state of devices within a networked environment conform to a device usage pattern represented by the record.

As will occur to those of skill in the art in typical embodiments the values of the entries in the device state history do not have to be exactly the same as the values of the device usage records to identify a matching device usage record. In fact the values of the entries of the device state history will often not be the exactly the same as the values of the device usage records when a matching record is identified. The degree to which the values of the entries in the device state history must be similar to the values of the device usage records to be considered a match will vary according to factors such as tolerances and methods used to compare the device state history with the device usage records predefined tolerances for identifying a match as well as other numerous factors that will occur to those of skill in the art.

The method of also includes identifying a derived scenario having an associated tolerance in dependence upon the identified device usage pattern . As discussed above a derived scenario represents a particular scenario created in dependence upon actual device usage within the networked environment. Derived scenarios have two important distinctions from other canned scenarios. First the derived scenarios are created in dependence upon the actual past device usage of the devices within the networked environment and therefore reflect scenarios of device usage of the particular networked environment. Second in the example of the derived scenarios have an associated tolerance . A tolerance is a rule set governing the execution of workflows executed in dependence upon the identified derived scenario.

In the method of identifying a derived scenario in dependence upon the identified device usage pattern further comprises retrieving a derived scenario ID from a derived scenario table. In the example of a derived scenario table includes a plurality of derived scenario IDs indexed by device usage IDs identifying predefined device usage patterns. Identifying a derived scenario in dependence upon the identified device usage pattern therefore includes retrieving a derived scenario ID from a derived scenario table in dependence upon the device usage ID of the identified device usage record .

In the method of identifying a derived scenario in dependence upon the identified device usage pattern further comprises identifying a derived scenario in dependence upon a rule . A rule governs the identification of a particular derived scenario among a plurality of derived scenarios when more than one derived scenario associated with a single device usage pattern exists. Consider the example of a user cooking in a networked kitchen. The states of the devices in a living room match a device usage pattern that the user is cooking. However more than one scenario corresponds with the device usage pattern as the user may be cooking breakfast cooking lunch or cooking supper. An exemplary rule identifying a scenario is If time of day is between 4 30 p.m. and 7 30 p.m. and device usage pattern identifies a cooking scenario then user is cooking supper.

The method of also includes identifying a workflow in dependence upon the derived scenario . As discussed above a workflow is software implementing a device controlling action that when executed changes the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices in accordance with the present invention. In the method of identifying a workflow in dependence upon the derived scenario comprises retrieving a workflow ID from a derived scenario record .

The method of also includes executing the workflow in dependence upon the tolerance . As discussed above a tolerance represents a rule governing the execution of a workflow. Often a tolerance is a subset of the range of acceptable attribute values that a device supports. Such tolerances are often designed to prevent the execution of workflows from damaging devices within the networked environment.

Consider the following example. A networked home has a number of devices that are used to cool the west wing of the home. These devices include a fan an air conditioner and automatic shades. However the automatic shades are currently not working and they currently will not close properly. Workflow decision management according to the present invention has identified a scenario within a home network demonstrating that the west wing of the home is too warm and therefore identifies and executes a workflow to cool the home that includes reducing the thermostat for the air conditioner increasing fan speed and closing the automatic shades.

Because the automatic shades are not working properly the workflow does not reduce the temperature in the west wing sufficiently and soon thereafter the scenario that the room is too hot is again identified. The same workflow is again identified and executed. By providing a tolerance for the execution of the workflow that defines a minimum tolerance value allowed for the thermostat the air conditioner is spared from being overworked to the point of damage. That is tolerances provide some boundaries for the execution of workflow preventing devices from being damaged by unforeseen problems with the execution of a workflow such as in this case the automatic shades not working properly. These tolerance values are often designed as a subset of the actual values that devices support. Such design advantageously recognizes that devices often support attribute values that will ultimately lead to damaging the device.

In the method of executing the workflow in dependence upon the tolerance further comprises sending a message to a device instructing the device to change the value of an attribute. In some such examples a device receiving such a method can effect the change in value of the device by calling a member method in a device class representing the device such as for example SomeDeviceClass.setAtrribute parameterized with an attribute value.

Logging messages sent to devices effecting one or more workflows may usefully provide a vehicle for identifying message patterns and message scenarios for workflow decision management. For further explanation therefore sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for workflow decision management that includes logging a message sent in the execution of a workflow. The method of includes maintaining a device state history . As discussed above a device state history is a data structure containing the history of the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices. A device state history for a single device can be maintained in computer memory on the device itself or a single device state history for many devices in the networked environment can be maintained in computer memory accessible to application programming implementing the method of .

In the method of maintaining a device state history includes recording a plurality of attribute values for a device. As discussed above each time an attribute value of a device is changed the change is recorded by creating a new entry in a device state history. In some such embodiments the latest entry in the device state history represents the current state of the device. In some embodiments workflow decision management devices are configured to report to application programming implementing a device state manager with each change in an attribute value and the device state manager creates a new entry in a device state history recording the change in attribute value.

The method of also includes identifying a device usage pattern in dependence upon the device state history . As discussed above a device usage record represents a predetermined pattern of device usage and includes a collection of device attribute values defining the device usage pattern. In the method of identifying an identified device usage pattern in dependence upon the device state history further comprises comparing the device state history with a plurality of device usage patterns records . In the example of a window of the entries of the device state history representing recent device states are compared with device usage records in a device usage pattern database to identify a matching device usage record . If such a matching device usage record exists then it is inferred that the current state of devices within a networked environment conform to a device usage pattern represented by the record.

As will occur to those of skill in the art in typical embodiments the values of the entries in the device state history do not have to be exactly the same as the values of the device usage records to identify a matching device usage record. In fact the values of the entries of the device state history will often not be the exactly the same as the values of the device usage records when a matching record is identified. The degree to which the values of the entries in the device state history must be similar to the values of the device usage records to be considered a match will vary according to factors such as tolerances and methods used to used to compare the device state history with the device usage records predefined tolerances for identifying a match as well as other numerous factors that will occur to those of skill in the art.

The method of also includes identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern . The workflow scenario of may be either a scenario predetermined and predefined generally from many users in many networked environments such as the scenario discussed above with reference to given the reference number or a derived scenario created in dependence upon the actual device usage within the networked environment discussed above with reference to and given the reference number .

Identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern may be carried out by retrieving a workflow scenario ID from a workflow scenario table . In the example of a workflow scenario table includes a plurality of workflow scenario IDs indexed by device usage IDs identifying predefined device usage patterns. Identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the identified device usage pattern therefore includes retrieving a workflow scenario ID from a workflow scenario table in dependence upon the device usage ID of the identified device usage record .

In the method of identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern is carried out in further dependence upon a rule . A rule governs the identification of a particular workflow scenario among a plurality of workflow scenarios when more than one workflow scenario associated with a single device usage pattern exists. Consider the example of a user cooking in a networked kitchen. The states of the devices in a living room match a device usage pattern that the user is cooking. However more than one workflow scenario corresponds with the device usage pattern as the user may be cooking breakfast cooking lunch or cooking supper. An exemplary rule identifying a workflow scenario is If time of day is between 4 30 p.m. and 7 30 p.m. and device usage pattern identifies a cooking scenario then user is cooking supper.

The method of also includes identifying a workflow in dependence upon the workflow scenario . As discussed above a workflow is software implementing a device controlling action that when executed changes the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices in accordance with the present invention. In the method of identifying a workflow in dependence upon the workflow scenario includes retrieving a workflow ID from a workflow scenario record .

The method of also includes executing the workflow including sending a message to a device to administer at least one value of an attribute of the device. As discussed above a workflow is software implementing a device controlling action that when executed changes the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices in accordance with the present invention. Such software effects the device controlling action by sending a message to a device instructing the device to change the value of an attribute. A device receiving such a method can effect the change in value of the device by calling a member methods in a device class representing the device such as for example SomeDeviceClass.setAtrribute parameterized with an attribute value sent in the message.

In the method of executing the workflow also includes executing the workflow in dependence upon an associated tolerance . A tolerance is a rule set governing the execution of workflows executed in dependence upon the identified derived scenario. Often a tolerance is a subset of the range of acceptable attribute values that a device supports. For example a thermostat may support attribute values that will if set will eventually damage either the thermostat itself or other devices. A tolerance is therefore often designed to govern the execution of workflows such that device usage is not harmful to devices within the networked environment.

The method of also includes logging the message . Logging the message according to the method of is carried out by recording in a message log message information. A message log is a data structure containing entries representing individual messages sent to one or more devices in the networked environment. In the example of the message log contains the message information including a message log ID a message ID the contents of the message and the time message was sent. Message logs usefully provide a record of the messages sent to device effecting the execution of workflows according to the present invention.

The message information included in the message log of is for explanation and not for limitation. In fact message information recorded in message logs will vary according to factors such as types of devices receiving the messages message type desired information concerning the message and other factors as will occur to those of skill in the art.

Message logs usefully provide a record of the messages sent to device effecting the execution of workflows according to the present invention. Such message logs may be used to identify patterns in the messages which themselves may be useful in identifying workflows for execution. For further explanation therefore sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating additional aspects of workflow decision management according to the present invention. The method of includes identifying a message pattern in dependence upon a plurality of messages sent to a device. In the example of identifying a message pattern in dependence upon a plurality of messages sent to a device is carried out by identifying a message pattern from information contained within a message log recording information about a plurality of message sent to one or more devices. Identifying a message pattern may be carried out by a user examining the entries of a message log and discovering patterns in the entries of the message log.

Requiring a user to manually identify message patterns may be too labor intensive to be practicable. In the method of therefore identifying a message pattern in dependence upon a plurality of messages sent to a device is carried out by data mining a message log including message information describing messages to devices in the networked environment. There are many definitions for data mining. For the purpose of this specification data mining means analyzing the recorded message information in the message log and discovering relationships patterns knowledge or information from the recorded message information and using the discovered relationships patterns or knowledge to identify message patterns for workflow decision management. Many data mining techniques typically include the steps of preparing the data for data mining choosing an appropriate data mining algorithm and deploying the data mining algorithm.

In the method of the recorded message information in the message log has been prepared for data mining by providing a predetermined data structure for the message log. Typically the predetermined data structure is provided when such a message log is created. The particular predetermined data structure for each particular kind of message log will vary depending on factors such as the type of messages being issued to devices to effect workflow decision management the kind of message information available for logging and so on as will occur to those of skill in the art.

Data mining also typically includes choosing an appropriate data mining algorithm. An appropriate data mining algorithm for discovering message patterns will vary on many factors such as the type of message information recorded in the message log available to mine the available computer software and hardware used to carry out the data mining the size of the collection of the message information in the message log or any other factor that will occur to those of skill in the art. Many data mining algorithms exist and all algorithms that appropriately find message patterns from a collection of message information recorded in a message log are within the scope of the present invention.

Although many data mining algorithms exist many of the data mining algorithms share the same goals. Typical data mining algorithms attempt to solve the problem of being overwhelmed by the volume of data that computers can collect. Data mining algorithms also typically attempt to shield users from the unwieldy body of data by analyzing it summarizing it or drawing conclusions from the data that the user can understand.

One way of discussing various data mining algorithms is by discussing the functions that they perform rather than the specifics of their underlying mathematical operation. Another way of discussing various data mining algorithms is by describing a rule returned by the data mining algorithm. A rule is a description of the relationship pattern knowledge or information found by the data mining algorithm. Exemplary data mining algorithms are explained in this specification by describing the functions they perform and the rules they return. The following examples of data mining algorithms are included in this specification for clarity of discussion not for limitation. Any method of data mining that will occur to those of skill in the art regardless of type classification or underlying mathematical operation is within the scope of the present invention.

In some examples of the method of identifying a message pattern includes data mining a message log with an association function. Association functions are typically used to find patterns having connected or related events. For example in the context of identifying message pattern data mining with association functions may return a rule such as 72 of the recorded messages to a thermostat were instructions to lower the thermostat and corresponded in time with messages to a ceiling fan to increase the speed of the ceiling fan. Data mining with an association function can be used to determine an association between the one or more fields of various entries in a message log. For example an association function may return a rule describing that some percentage of messages to a thermostat are to reduce the setting of the thermostat.

In other examples of the method of identifying a message pattern includes data mining a message log with sequential pattern operators. Data mining with sequential patterns is typically used in analyzing message information in a message log of a single type. A sequential pattern operator may be used to return a rule that describes a sequential relationship among entries in a message log to the same device. An example of a rule describing relationship among such entries in a message log is a rule that identifies that three messages to a thermostat in a row included instructions to raise the setting of the thermostat thereby indicating that the temperature outside the area governed by the thermostat was dropping causing the area governed by the thermostat to drop.

In still other examples of the method of identifying a message pattern includes data mining with a classification operator. A classification operator is applied to a set of entries in a message log that are organized or tagged as belonging to a certain class such as for example recorded message information of messages sent at a certain time of day. A classification operator examines the set of tagged entries in a message log and produces a mathematical function that identifies the class. Such a classification operator can be used for example to analyze a class of entries in a message log received at a certain time of day and determine the time of day with the most message traffic.

In still other examples of the method of identifying a message pattern includes data mining with a clustering operator. By contrast to data mining with a classification operator whose input is a set of tagged entries in a message log the input to a clustering operator is a set of untagged entries in a message log. No classes are known at the time the clustering operator is applied. Data mining with a cluster operator may be used to segment or classify the entries in a message log such as by segmenting the entries by time of day or device ID. Many of the underlying mathematical operations used to build classification operators can also be used to build clustering operators.

While various data mining algorithms have been discussed separately in various examples of the method of different data mining algorithms can may be used together to identify message patterns. Furthermore while the method of has been described in detail with regard to data mining any method identifying a subset of the message log that comprise a message pattern is within the scope of the present invention not just data mining. In various exemplary embodiments identifying a subset of the message log that comprise a message pattern includes using data discrimination using artificial intelligence using machine learning using pattern recognition or any method of identifying a subset of the message log that comprise a message pattern that will occur to those of skill in the art.

One example of off the shelf data mining software includes IBM s Intelligent Miner. Intelligent Miner can be operated in several computing environments including AIX AS 400 and OS 390. The Intelligent Miner is an enterprise data mining tool designed for client server configurations and optimized to mine very large data sets such as gigabyte data sets. The Intelligent Miner includes a plurality of data mining techniques or tools used to analyze large databases and provides visualization tools used to view and interpret the different mining results.

Having identified a message pattern records representing such patterns may be created and usefully provide a vehicle for identifying workflows for execution when such messages in the networked environment conform to the identified message patterns. In the example of a message pattern record represents an identified message pattern. The entries in the message pattern record include a message pattern ID uniquely identifying the message pattern. Entries in the message pattern record also include a message type identifying a type of message sent to a device and the device ID identifying the device to which the message is sent. Entries in the message pattern record also include the attributes of the message defining the device controlling instruction contained in the message and a message sequence ID identifying the position in the message pattern in which the particular message resides.

The method of includes storing the message pattern records representing the identified message patterns in a message pattern database . A message pattern database maintains a plurality of message pattern records for use in identifying message patterns in the message traffic in the networked environment.

The method of also includes identifying a message pattern in dependence upon a plurality of messages sent to a device or a plurality of devices in the networked environment. A message pattern record represents a pre identified pattern of messages. In the method of identifying a message pattern in dependence upon a plurality of messages may be carried out by comparing a plurality of messages in the networked environment or recent entries in a message log with a plurality of message pattern records in a message pattern database. In the example of a window of the entries of the message log representing recent messages may be compared with message records to identify a matching message record. If such a matching message record exists then it is inferred that the message traffic in the networked environment conforms to a message pattern represented by the message pattern record.

As will occur to those of skill in the art in typical embodiments the aspects of the messages in the message log or in traffic in the networked environment do not have to be exactly the same as the values of the message pattern records to identify a matching message pattern record. In fact the values of the entries of the message log or messages in traffic will often not be the exactly the same as the values of the message pattern records when a matching record is identified. The degree to which the values of the entries in the message log or the messages in traffic must be similar to the values of the message pattern records to be considered a match will vary according to factors such as methods used to compare the messages and entries of the message log with the message pattern records predefined tolerances for identifying a match as well as other numerous factors that will occur to those of skill in the art.

The method of includes identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern and in dependence upon the message pattern . The workflow scenario of may be either a scenario predetermined and predefined generally from many users in many networked environments such as the scenario discussed above with reference to given the reference number or a derived scenario created in dependence upon the actual device usage within the networked environment discussed above with reference to and given the reference number .

Identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern and in dependence upon the message pattern may be carried out by retrieving a workflow scenario ID from a workflow scenario table . In the example of a workflow scenario table includes a plurality of workflow scenario IDs indexed by device usage IDs identifying predefined device usage patterns and message pattern IDs identifying message patterns. Identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern and in dependence upon the message pattern therefore includes retrieving a workflow scenario ID from a workflow scenario table in dependence upon the device usage ID of the identified device usage record and the message pattern ID of the identified message pattern.

In the method of identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern and in dependence upon the message pattern may be is carried out in further dependence upon a rule . A rule governs the identification of a particular workflow scenario among a plurality of workflow scenarios when more than one workflow scenario associated with a single device usage pattern exists and message pattern exists.

Having identified a workflow scenario workflow decision management according to embodiments of the present invention may proceed by identifying a workflow and executing the workflow as discussed above with reference to . The addition of message patterns usefully provides additional granularity in selecting workflow scenarios and provides a vehicle for better tailoring the results of workflow decision management in a networked environment.

As discussed above a workflow is software implementing a device controlling action that when executed changes the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices in accordance with the present invention. Such software effects the device controlling action by sending a message to a device instructing the device to change the value of an attribute. Devices in workflow decision management systems may be at risk of receiving messages implementing destructive actions implemented by viruses or other destructive entities. Destructive messages may be sent to one or more devices in a networked environment instructing the device to administer its attributes causing damage to the device. Such destructive messages may be created to have enough similarity to the defined packets structures of protocols used in workflow decision management that a receiving device will respond to the message in a manner destructive to the device. Such destructive messages may also be sent by invalid workflows created as viruses and installed on one or more devices under workflow decision management. To reduce the possibility of destructive messages causing damage to device intermediate message validation services are provided for message validation.

For further explanation sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for workflow decision management that includes determining whether a message sent to a device is valid. As with the examples of discussed above the method of includes maintaining a device state history identifying a device usage pattern in dependence upon the device state history identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon the device usage pattern and identifying a workflow in dependence upon the workflow scenario .

The method of also includes executing the identified workflow . As discussed above a workflow is software implementing a device controlling action that when executed changes the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices in accordance with the present invention. Such software effects the device controlling action by sending a message to a device instructing the device to change the value of an attribute. In the example of however instead of sending the message directly to the device executing the identified workflow is carried out by sending to an intermediate message validation service a message to be forwarded to a device to administer at least one value of an attribute of the device . Such a message may be sent to an intermediate message validation service with routing information dictating one or more devices intended as recipients of the message and to which the intermediate message validation service is to forward the message upon determining that the message is valid.

The method includes determining by the intermediate message validation service whether the message is valid. Determining whether the message is valid may be carried out by determining differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure and determining whether differences between the structure of the packet of the message and the predefined proper packet structure do not exceed a threshold similarity requirement as discussed in more detail below with reference to .

If the message is valid the method of includes forwarding by the intermediate message validation service the valid message to the device . Forwarding by the intermediate message validation service the valid message to the device may be carried out by sending one or more packets of the message from the intermediate validation service to the device according to routing information provided in the original message as sent to execute the workflow identified in response to the device usage pattern on the network.

Workflow decision management according to embodiments of the present invention may also include logging the valid message. Logging the valid message may be carried out by recording in a message log message information describing the valid message. As discussed above with reference to a message log is a data structure containing entries representing individual messages sent to one or more devices in the networked environment. Message logs usefully provide a record of the messages sent to device effecting the execution of workflows according to the present invention.

If the message is invalid the method of includes terminating by the intermediate message validation service the invalid message . Terminating by the intermediate message validation service the invalid message may be carried out by storing the invalid message in a dead message queue on . Such a dead message queue may be implemented as data storage designed to receive the invalid messages and designed to quarantine the invalid messages from traffic on the network. Such a dead message queue may therefore also provide a log of invalid messages on the network useful in examining invalid message traffic and identifying the sender of such invalid messages.

Terminating by the intermediate message validation service the message to the device may alternatively include dropping one or more invalid packets of the invalid message . Dropping invalid packets of the invalid message terminates the forwarding of the message advantageously protecting the device from potentially harmful instructions carried in invalid messages.

The method of also includes notifying a system administrator that the message is invalid. Notifying a system administrator that the message is invalid may be carried out by sending an email to a system administrator providing a dead message queue to a system administrator or any other way of notifying a system administrator of invalid messages that will occur to those of skill in the art. Notifying a system administrator usefully informs system administrators of invalid and therefore potentially destructive message traffic on the network.

In the example of a message is only forwarded to a device if the message is determined to be valid. For further explanation therefore sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for determining whether a message sent to a device is valid. In the method of determining whether a message is valid is carried out by determining differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure . Determining differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure is often carried out by comparing one or more packets of the message with a predefined proper message structure. Such comparison may be carried out using various granularity of comparison such as bit by bit byte by byte and so on.

A predefined proper packet structure useful in valid message identification may be derived from specifications defining protocols used in the networked environment for workflow decision management. A predefined proper packet structure may be implemented device by device in a networked environment or may be implemented network wide. That is a predefined proper packet structure for one device may vary from a predefined proper packet structure of another device in the networked environment. Alternatively a single predefined proper packet structure may be implemented for the networked environment as a whole.

The differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure may be a numerical representation of the number of differences between the structure of the packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure. That is the differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure may be determined by comparing the packet of the message and the predefined proper packet structure and counting the differences bit by bit byte by byte and so on.

Alternatively determining the differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure may be carried out by identifying qualitative differences between the packet and the proper packets structure. Examples of a qualitative difference between a packet of the message and the predefined proper packet structure includes required values in required locations in the proper packets structure not found in the packet of the message sent to the device.

As mentioned above a predefined proper packet structure useful in valid message identification may be derived from specifications defining protocols used in the networked environment for workflow decision management. For further explanation therefore sets forth a data flow diagram of an example of determining differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure derived from the CEBus specification. CEBus is an abbreviation for Consumer Electronics Bus. CEBus is an open international standard for controlling devices over different media such as power line radio frequency RF infrared IR coaxial cable twisted pair fiber optics and audio video. The CEBus standard is promulgated by the Consumer Electronic Manufacturers Association CEMA a sector of the Electronics Industries Association EIA and described in 12 standards the ANSI EIA 600 series. The CEBus standard describes a physical design and topology of network media a protocol for message generation and a common application language CAL . The CEBus specification is available for download at http www.cebus.org.

The exemplary predefined CEBus packet structure of includes a Link Protocol Data Unit LPDU . The LDPU is a maximum length of 41 bytes and includes a LPDU header that contains the control field that is one byte long. The control field identifies the packet type packet priority and service class to the data link layer. The LPDU header also contains the destination address and the source address . In the example of the destination address is four bytes long and the source address is four bytes long. The LPDU also includes CAL Statements including command or status information often used to administer one or more attributes of a device.

The exemplary predefined CEBus packet structure of includes a Network Protocol Data Unit NPDU that includes a NPDU header and CAL statements . The NPDU header specifies how a packet is sent.

The exemplary predefined CEBus packet structure of also includes an Application Protocol Data Unit APDU that includes an APDU header and CAL statements . The APDU header specifies how and if a receiving application layer should respond to the packet.

Determining differences between the structure of a packet of the message and the predefined CEBus Packet structure according to the example of may be carried out by comparing a packets of the message with each aspect of the predefined CEBUS packets structure and determining any difference between the length and content an LPDU NPDU and APDU of the packet and the required length and content of the LPDU NPDU and APDU of the predefined CEBUS packet structure .

The inclusion of a predefined CEBUS packet structure is for explanation and not for limitation. In fact workflow decision management may be implemented using many protocols and predefined proper packet structures may be derived for any such protocols and all such predefined proper packet structures are well within the scope of the present invention.

Again with reference to After determining differences between the structure of a packet of the message and a predefined proper packet structure the method of also includes determining that differences between the structure of the packet of the message and the predefined proper packet structure do not exceed a threshold similarity requirement . A threshold similarity requirement is implemented as one or more rules defining the required similarity between the structure of the packet of the message and the predefined proper packets structure for a determination that the message is valid. For further explanation consider the following threshold similarity requirement 

In the example above one or more packets of the message are compared bit by bit with the predefined proper packet structure to determine if the number of bits in a packet of message is greater or less than the number of bits in predefined proper packet structure. In this example the message is determined to be invalid if the number of bits in packet of message is greater or less than the number of bits in predefined proper packet structure. The message is determined to be valid if the number of bits in the packet of the message is exactly the same number of bits in the predefined proper packet structure.

In the method of the message is determined to be valid if the differences between the structure of the packet of the message and the predefined proper packet structure do not exceed a threshold similarity requirement . As discussed above valid messages are typically forwarded to the intended device to implement one or more workflows.

In the method of the message is determined to be invalid if the differences between the structure of the packet of the message and the predefined proper packet structure exceed a threshold similarity requirement . As discussed above invalid messages are typically terminated thereby removing potentially dangerous messages from the network traffic.

For clarity of discussion the examples of workflow decision management discussed above have been directed toward executing a single workflow in response to device usage patterns of one or more devices. A networked domain however often has many devices whose current state may invoke a plurality of workflows executed without regard to the execution of other workflows. Such a plurality of workflows may be identified and executed simultaneously in series in overlapping time periods and so on as will occur to those of skill in the art.

As discussed above workflows are often executed in dependence upon an associated tolerance. A tolerance is an associated rule set governing the execution of a workflow executed in dependence upon an identified workflow scenario. The tolerance is often designed to govern the execution of workflows such that device usage is not harmful to devices within the networked environment. Often such a tolerance is a subset of the range of acceptable attribute values that a device supports. When a plurality of workflows are executed simultaneously in close temporal proximity or in overlapping time periods the execution of more than one workflow may result in more than one message being sent to a device to administer one or more attributes of the device. Such messages may conflict or together provide a harmful effect on the device even though the device administering instructions of the messages are within the allowed tolerance of their workflow.

To resolve such conflicts and to prevent unintended harmful effects of the execution of a plurality of workflows workflow administration capacities are provided. A workflow administration capacity typically implements one or more rules governing the execution of a plurality of workflows executed in dependence upon a plurality of identified workflow scenarios. The workflow administration capacity is often designed to resolve conflicting instructions to devices when more than one workflow administers a single device and to prevent the execution of a plurality of workflows from damaging a device. Workflow administration capacities are often derived from the individual tolerances of the individual identified workflow scenarios and individual device capacities of the devices administered by workflow decision management according to the present invention.

For further explanation sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating in exemplary method for workflow decision management that includes executing simultaneously multiple workflows in accordance with workflow administration capacities. The method of includes maintaining a device state history for a plurality of devices . As discussed above the device state history is a data structure containing the history of the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices. A device state history for a plurality of devices can be maintained in a single device state history for many devices in the networked environment. Such a device state history is typically maintained in computer memory accessible to application programming implementing the method of .

In the method of maintaining a device state history may be carried out by recording a plurality of attribute values for a plurality of devices. In the example of each time an attribute value of a device is changed the change is recorded by creating a new entry in a device state history. In some such embodiments the latest entry in the device state history for a particular device represents the current state of the device. In some embodiments workflow decision management devices are configured to report to application programming implementing a device state manager with each change in an attribute value and the device state manager creates a new entry in a device state history recording the change in attribute value and the device ID of the reporting device.

The method of also includes identifying a plurality of device usage patterns in dependence upon the device state history . As discussed above a device usage record represents a predetermined pattern of device usage and includes a collection of device attribute values defining the device usage pattern. In the method of identifying a plurality of device usage patterns in dependence upon the device state history is carried out by comparing the device state history with a plurality of device usage patterns records. In the example of entries of the device state history representing recent device states for a plurality of devices are compared with device usage records in a device usage pattern database to identify a matching device usage record . If such a matching device usage record exists then it is inferred that the current state of devices within a networked environment conform to a device usage pattern represented by the record.

As will occur to those of skill in the art in typical embodiments the values of the entries in the device state history do not have to be exactly the same as the values of the device usage records to identify a matching device usage record. In fact the values of the entries of the device state history will often not be the exactly the same as the values of the device usage records when a matching record is identified. The degree to which the values of the entries in the device state history must be similar to the values of the device usage records to be considered a match will vary according to factors such as tolerances and methods used to compare the device state history with the device usage records predefined tolerances for identifying a match as well as other numerous factors that will occur to those of skill in the art.

The method of also includes identifying a plurality of workflow scenarios in dependence upon the device usage patterns . The workflow scenario of may be either a scenario predetermined and predefined generally from many users in many networked environments such as the scenario discussed above with reference to given the reference number or a derived scenario created in dependence upon the actual device usage within the networked environment discussed above with reference to and given the reference number .

In the example of each workflow scenario has an associated tolerance . As discussed above a tolerance is a rule set governing the execution of workflows executed in dependence upon the identified derived scenario.

In the method of identifying a plurality of workflow scenarios in dependence upon the device usage patterns may be carried out by retrieving a plurality of workflow scenario IDs from a workflow scenario table . In the example of a workflow scenario table includes a plurality of workflow scenario IDs indexed by device usage IDs identifying predefined device usage patterns. Identifying a plurality of workflow scenarios in dependence upon the device usage patterns therefore includes retrieving a workflow scenario IDs from a workflow scenario table in dependence upon the plurality of device usage IDs of the identified device usage record .

In the method of identifying a plurality of workflow scenarios in dependence upon the device usage patterns typically includes identifying a workflow scenario in dependence upon one or more rules . A rule governs the identification of a particular workflow scenario among a plurality of workflow scenarios when more than one such workflow scenario associated with a single device usage pattern exists. Consider the example of a user cooking in a networked kitchen. The states of the devices in a living room match a device usage pattern that the user is cooking. However more than one scenario corresponds with the device usage pattern as the user may be cooking breakfast cooking lunch or cooking supper. An exemplary rule identifying a scenario is If time of day is between 4 30 p.m. and 7 30 p.m. and device usage pattern identifies a cooking scenario then user is cooking supper.

The method of further comprises determining a workflow administration capacity in dependence upon the plurality of workflow scenarios. A workflow administration capacity typically implements one or more rules governing the execution of a plurality of workflows executed in dependence upon a plurality of identified workflow scenario. The workflow administration capacity is often designed to resolve conflicting instructions to devices when more than one workflow administers a single device and to prevent the execution of a plurality of workflows from damaging a device.

Determining a workflow administration capacity from the tolerances of the workflow scenarios may be carried out by determining whether the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios conflict as discussed in more detail below with reference to . Determining a workflow administration capacity in dependence upon the plurality of workflow scenarios may also be carried out by identifying a plurality of devices administered by the plurality of workflow scenarios identifying an associated tolerance for each the workflow scenario retrieving individual device capacities for the identified devices and identifying an administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices in dependence upon the associated tolerances for the workflows and the individual device capacities as discussed in more detail below with reference to . An individual device capacity is typically the range of acceptable attribute values that a device supports without damage to the device. That is devices often support an attribute value that if set may damage the device or lead to damage to the device. An individual device capacity therefore may be a subset of the actual attribute values that the device will support that do not typically give rise to damage of the device.

The method of also includes identifying a plurality of workflows in dependence upon the workflow scenario . As discussed above a workflow is software implementing a device controlling action that when executed changes the values of one or more attributes of one or more devices in accordance with the present invention. In the method of identifying a plurality of workflows in dependence upon the workflow scenario may be carried out by retrieving a workflow ID from each identified workflow scenario record .

The method of also includes executing the plurality of workflows in dependence upon the workflow administration capacity . As discussed above a workflow administration capacity is typically implements one or more rules governing the execution of a plurality of workflows executed in dependence upon a plurality of identified workflow scenario. The workflow administration capacity is often designed to resolve conflicting instructions to devices when more than one workflow administers a single device and to prevent the execution of a plurality of workflows from damaging a device.

In the method of executing the plurality of workflows in dependence upon the workflow administration capacity sending a message to a plurality of devices each message instructing the device to change the value of an attribute. In some such examples a device receiving such a message can effect the change in value of the device by calling a member method in a device class representing the device such as for example SomeDeviceClass.setAtrribute parameterized with an attribute value.

For further explanation consider the following example. A networked home has a number of devices that are used to cool the west wing of the home and designed to cool the east end of the house. These devices also include a fan an air conditioner and automatic shades. The networked home also has devices for reducing the glare through windows in the west wing at certain times of day. These devices include the same automatic shades and automatic blinds. Workflow decision management according to the present invention identifies two workflow scenarios within the home network. The first workflow scenario represents the west wing of the home being is too warm and therefore identifies a workflow to cool the home that includes reducing the thermostat for the air conditioner increasing fan speed and closing the automatic shades. The second workflow scenario represents a scenario where there is little glare through windows in the west wing due to the current position of the blinds and automatic shades and therefore identifies a workflow to open the automatic shades and the automatic blinds. The execution of both workflows conflict with regard the automatic shades. Workflow decision management determines a workflow administration capacity that administers the conflict between the two work flows. Executing the plurality of workflows in dependence upon the workflow administration capacity results reducing the thermostat for the air conditioner increasing fan speed and opening the automatic blinds but not closing the automatic shades.

As discussed above a workflow administration capacity implements one or more rules governing the execution of a plurality of workflows executed in dependence upon a plurality of identified workflow scenario. The workflow administration capacity is often designed to resolve conflicting instructions to devices when more than one workflow administers a single device and to prevent the execution of a plurality of workflows from damaging a device. For further explanation sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for determining a workflow administration capacity in dependence upon the plurality of workflow scenarios that includes determining whether the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios conflict. Determining whether the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios conflict may be carried out by identifying the devices administered by executing the workflows and determining whether a single device is administered by more than one workflow.

If a single device is administered by the execution of more than one workflow determining whether the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios conflict includes determining whether the single device receives conflicting instructions by the execution of the workflows. Conflicting instructions typically include instructions to set the value of an attribute of the device sent in the execution of one workflow that does not conform to the objectives of the other workflow. That is the instructions to a device sent by one workflow do not achieve the objectives of the other workflow. An example of conflicting instructions includes an instruction to raise the target temperature value of a thermostat sent in the execution one workflow and an instruction to lower the target temperature value of a thermostat in the execution of another workflow.

If the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios do not conflict the method of includes executing the workflows. Executing the workflows typically includes sending a message to a plurality of devices each message instructing the device to change the value of an attribute. In some such examples a device receiving such a message can effect the change in value of the device by calling a member method in a device class representing the device such as for example SomeDeviceClass.setAtrribute parameterized with an attribute value.

If the workflows associated with the workflow scenarios conflict the method of includes augmenting the workflows and executing the augmented workflows. Augmenting the workflows may be carried out by identifying a device receiving conflicting instructions by the execution of the workflows and terminating messages to the device. In such cases the workflows are executed for every device that does not receive conflicting messages and the devices receiving conflicting messages are not administered by any of the plurality of workflows.

Alternatively augmenting the workflows may be carried out by retrieving from a workflow conflict resolution table another workflow ID in dependence upon the workflow IDs of the conflicting workflows. In such cases a workflow conflict resolution table includes workflow IDs for non conflicting workflows predetermined to resolve conflicts between existing workflows. The workflow conflict resolution table includes workflow IDs for non conflicting workflows indexed by other workflow IDs predetermined to conflict. A lookup on such an exemplary workflow conflict resolution table with the conflicting workflow IDs retrieves a non conflicting workflow ID.

As discussed above a workflow administration capacity implements one or more rules governing the execution of a plurality of workflows executed in dependence upon a plurality of identified workflow scenario. The workflow administration capacity is often designed to resolve conflicting instructions to devices when more than one workflow administers a single device and to prevent the execution of a plurality of workflows from damaging a device. For further explanation sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for determining a workflow administration capacity useful in preventing the execution of a plurality of workflows from damaging a device. In the example of determining a workflow administration capacity includes identifying a plurality of devices administered by the plurality of workflow scenarios . Identifying a plurality of devices administered by the plurality of workflow scenarios may be carried out by retrieving a workflow record identified by the workflow ID in the workflow scenario and calling a method such as getDevices parameterized with the workflow ID that is designed to retrieve the device IDs of the devices administered by the workflow identified by workflow ID.

The method of includes identifying an associated tolerance for each the workflow scenario. Identifying an associated tolerance for each the workflow scenario may be carried out by retrieving from each workflow scenario record a tolerance ID identifying tolerance associated with the workflow scenario.

The method of also includes retrieving individual device capacities for the identified devices . An individual device capacity is typically the range of acceptable attribute values that a device supports without damage to the device. That is devices often support an attribute value that if set may damage the device or lead to damage to the device. An individual device capacity therefore may be a subset of the actual attribute values that the device will support that do not typically give rise to damage of the device. Retrieving individual device capacities for the identified devices may be carried out by calling a method such as getDevicesCapacities parameterized with the device IDs that is designed to retrieve the device capacities of the devices administered identified by the device ID.

In the example of the device capacity is represented in data as a device capacity record . The device capacity record of includes a device capacity ID uniquely identifying the device capacity. The device capacity record of includes a device ID identifying the device having the device capacity. The device capacity record of also includes a capacity including a range of acceptable attribute values that a device supports without damage to the device.

The method of also identifying an administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices in dependence upon the associated tolerances for the workflows and the individual device capacities. Identifying an administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices may be carried out by selecting a workflow administration capacity record in dependence upon the identified device capacities the associated tolerances and workflow scenarios as discussed below with reference to . Identifying an administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices may also be carried out by dynamically determining for an administration capacity record in dependence upon the identified device capacities the associated tolerances the workflow scenarios and a dynamic administration rule as discussed below with reference to .

For further explanation sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating an exemplary method for identifying a workflow administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices. In the example of identifying a workflow administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices includes selecting a workflow administration capacity record in dependence upon the identified device capacities the associated tolerances and the workflow scenarios .

A workflow administration capacity record is a data structure representing a workflow administration capacity designed to govern the execution of a plurality of workflows. The workflow administration capacity record of includes a capacity ID uniquely identifying the workflow administration capacity. The workflow administration capacity record also includes a device list that includes a list of identifications of the devices implemented by the workflows. The workflow administration capacity record includes a workflow list including a list of identifications of the workflows governed by the workflow administration capacity. The workflow administration capacity record also includes the capacity implementing the acceptable device attribute ranges of the devices on the device list for the execution of the workflows on the workflow list.

Selecting a workflow administration capacity record in dependence upon the identified device capacities the associated tolerances and the workflow scenarios may be carried out by performing a lookup in a workflow administration capacity database in dependence upon the device capacity IDs of the device capacities the tolerance level IDs of the associated tolerances and the workflow scenario IDS of the workflow scenarios .

Alternatively identifying an administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices may be carried out dynamically. For further explanation sets forth a data flow diagram illustrating another method for dynamically identifying a workflow administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices. In the example of identifying a workflow administration capacity for the administration of the identified devices includes dynamically determining an administration capacity in dependence upon the identified device capacities the associated tolerances the workflow scenarios and a dynamic administration rule .

A dynamic administration rule is implemented as one or more rules governing the dynamic identification of workflow administration capacities. For further explanation consider the following dynamic workflow administration capacity rule 

In the exemplary workflow administration capacity rule above a workflow administration capacity named as WACID 4 is identified when the device capacities named DCID 123 DCID 14 DCID 12 and DCID 523 have been identified as capacities for the devices executing the workflows identified in the workflow scenarios and the tolerances named TCID 3 and TID 4 are associated with the workflow scenarios named WSID 34 and WSID 3. Workflow administration capacity rules advantageously provide a vehicle for dynamically identifying workflow administration capacities.
