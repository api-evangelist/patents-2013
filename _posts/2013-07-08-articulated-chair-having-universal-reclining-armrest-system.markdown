This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 982 815 entitled ARTICULATED CHAIR HAVING UNIVERSAL RECLINING ARMREST SYSTEM filed Dec. 30 2010 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 480172 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 324 836 entitled ARTICULATED CHAIR HAVING UNIVERSAL RECLINING ARMREST SYSTEM filed Nov. 27 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 862 123 which are all incorporated herein in their entirety.

The present invention relates generally to positionable or articulated chairs and more specifically to an articulated chair incorporating a universal reclining armrest system. In particular at least some embodiments of the present invention relate to an articulated chair operable to move between an upright position and a reclined position wherein an initial plane or a desired user configured position of the armrest is maintained or substantially maintained throughout the chair s operable range of motion.

Articulated examination and treatment chairs are used to position a patient in any of a variety of different positions that may be selected in accordance with a particular procedure being performed and with reference to the preferences of the particular operator or doctor. For intravenous procedures utilizing the arm of the patient such as intravenous infusions anesthesia dialysis chemotherapy phlebotomy and platelet or plasma apheresis the arm of the patient must be positioned in a generally extended position such that the antecubital region of the arm is clearly exposed. As such the needle or catheter used for the intravenous procedure as well as the vein of the patient remains free from occlusion or other perturbations that are generally incompatible with the procedure.

A proper positioning of the patient s arm is typically accomplished and maintained by an armrest attached to a portion of the articulated chair. While a generally upright position is preferred for most intravenous procedures some procedures or patient conditions require that the chair be moved from an upright position to a reclined position during the intravenous procedure. Such repositioning not only changes the position of the chair and the patient but also changes the position of the patient s arm. Such changes may result in an arm position that is undesirable or unfavorable for the intravenous procedure.

An articulated chair can be adjusted to accommodate various procedures as well as various anatomic differences between patients. As such a single chair will often require multiple sets of interchangeable armrests. The multiple sets of interchangeable armrests are commonly side specific thereby requiring matched pairs of armrests to accommodate left hand and right hand procedures.

Thus while various forms of armrests currently exist for articulated chairs challenges still exist. Accordingly it would be an improvement in the art to augment or even replace current armrest systems or techniques with other armrests or techniques.

The present invention relates generally to articulated chairs and more specifically to an articulated chair incorporating a universal reclining or pivoting system to hold or support the patient s arm. In particular at least some embodiments of the present invention relate to an articulated chair operable to move between an upright position and a reclined position wherein an initial plane or a desired user configured position of the armrest is maintained throughout the chair s operable range of motion.

Implementations of the present invention take place in association with an articulated chair having multiple hingedly coupled sections such as a seat and leg rest section or a separate leg rest section and a backrest section. In some implementations the articulated chair further includes a base having means for moving the sections of the chair into desired configurations such as into a reclined position an upright position and a semi reclined position.

An articulated chair in accordance with the present invention further includes a pivoting mechanism by which an armrest assembly of the chair is maintained in a desired plane or position throughout the operable range of motion for the chair. Some implementations of the present invention further include an armrest adapter assembly that is reversibly coupled to a portion of the chair s pivoting mechanism. The armrest adapter assembly includes an adjustable aperture for receiving a post portion of an armrest. Thus in some implementations of the present invention the armrest assembly is coupled to the pivoting mechanism of the chair via the armrest adapter assembly.

The armrest assembly generally includes a surface on which to hold or support an arm of a patient. In some embodiments an armrest assembly is provided that is configured to hold a patient s arm in a position favorable for receiving and facilitating an intravenous catheter needle or procedure. In other embodiments an ergonomic cushion is provided as part of the armrest assembly wherein the ergonomic cushion is configured to hold the patient s arm in a position favorable for intravenous devices and procedures. Some armrest assemblies in accordance with the present invention further include an adjustable joint whereby the position configuration and orientation of the armrest platform is capable of being adjusted relative to the fixed position of the armrest adapter and pivoting mechanism. In other embodiments the armrest assembly includes a fixed joint which fixes and maintains the position of the armrest platform relative to the fixed position or plane of the armrest adapter.

Finally in some implementations of the present invention the armrest adapter is modified to include a channel that compatibly receives a sled portion of an armrest assembly. The sled portion is slidably coupled to the channel thereby allowing anterior and posterior adjustment of the armrest assembly relative to the armrest adapter. In some embodiments an adjustable joint such as a ball joint is interposed between the armrest assembly and the armrest adapter to provide further adjustment between the coupled components.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth or will become more fully apparent in the description that follows and in the appended claims. The features and advantages may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. Furthermore the features and advantages of the invention may be learned by the practice of the invention or will be obvious from the description as set forth hereinafter.
