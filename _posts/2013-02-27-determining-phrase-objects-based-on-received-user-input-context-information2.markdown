title: Determining phrase objects based on received user input context information
abstract: A composer interface allows a user to provide input, such as text data, to the social networking system. To reduce the number of inputs for a user to provide to the social networking system, one or more phrase objects are presented to the user when providing input. A phrase object includes a group of objects that users have previously provided to the social networking system. The social networking system presents phrase objects to the user that match at least a portion of the received input. Context information associated with the input and associated with various phrase objects may be used to select the presented phrase objects. By selecting a presented phrase object, the user includes the selected phrase object in the input.

This invention relates generally to social networking systems and in particular to determining phrase objects to present to a user on a social networking system.

Social networking systems allow their users to efficiently communicate information with each other to encourage interactions between users. Social networking systems allow users to share content with each other to organize events for users to meet in person to establish connections with other users or to perform other interactions with each other. To encourage user interactions social networking systems strive to streamline interactions between the user and the social networking system. For example a social networking system provides its users with interfaces that seek to reduce the number of clicks to reach a page to reduce the number of characters a user inputs to provide content to the social networking system and to reduce clutter when presenting content to users. Simplifying user interactions with the social networking system increases the likelihood that users continue using a social networking system.

However users increasingly access social networking systems and other systems through mobile devices. Many mobile devices are configured to receive user input through methods different from traditional user input methods such as keyboards and mice. This use of different input methods limits the effectiveness of conventional techniques for simplifying user interaction with a social networking system. For example conventional social networking systems are unable to effectively reduce the number of inputs e.g. number of button presses or strokes necessary for users to enter words or phrases for communication to the social networking system. Conventionally used predictive text capabilities do not account for user specific information so they often do not suggest relevant words until after a user has entered a number of characters.

A social networking system provides a user with a composer interface for receiving content from the user such as posts of content for presenting to other social networking system users. To simplify entry of content the social networking system analyzes input received via the composer interface and presents the user with candidate phrase objects based on the input. A phrase object is a combination of objects maintained by the social networking system. For example a phrase object includes a combination of words phrases links pictures videos events friends connections time and the like. For example the word bunny may be coupled with an image of a small rabbit to form a phrase object. In another example a phrase object is the word bunny and a user s profile maintained by the social networking system. Hence phrase objects may include an object maintained by the social networking system and text associated with the object. An object may comprise textual data e.g. words links visual data e.g. images video icons audio data e.g. sound files audio messages or other suitable type of data. Additionally an object may be any entity e.g. individuals websites pages companies groups and the like that is defined by the social networking system. In an embodiment a phrase object may be two or more words that are used together by social networking system users. The words in a phrase object may have different parts of speech and be combined based on their use by social networking system users.

In one embodiment phrase objects are selected and extracted from posts previously received by social networking system users. A post is content received by the social networking system for presentation to social networking system users. The social networking system analyzes received posts and identifies candidate objects for a phrase object based on the posts. Candidate objects may include words links names photos or other data used in a threshold number of posts or in a threshold percentage of posts. After identifying a candidate object the social networking system identifies objects in posts including the candidate object within a threshold distance of the candidate object. For example the social networking system analyzes objects within a threshold number of words or objects from a candidate object in the posts. Any suitable method such as text rules grammatical rules text patterns common usages and so forth may be used to identify objects included along with a candidate object in a phrase object. The social networking system may also determine context associated with a post from which a phrase object is identified and associate the context with extracted phrase object as metadata. Examples of context include descriptive or social information of the user associated with the post geographic information associated with the post temporal data associated with the post or other suitable information. Statistical information such as the rate with which a phrase object is used the popularity of the phrase object or other suitable information may also be associated with an extracted phrase object.

To reduce the number of characters a user has to input the social networking system may provide phrase objects as suggestions while the user is providing input to the social networking system. For example a user begins typing bu in an interface provided by the social networking system and phrase objects matching at least a portion of the received input such as bunny bunny store bunny feed cute bunny are displayed. The user may select a presented phrase object rather than continue entering text data. Phrase objects presented to the user may be selected based on the context of the post the received content for the post as well as statistical values associated with phrase objects. In one embodiment the location associated with the user provided post content is used to select displayed phrase objects. For example if bu is received while the user is composing a post in a pet store bunny bunny store bunny feed and cute bunny are displayed however if the user provides bu while in a chemistry laboratory different phrase objects such as burning Bunsen burner butane and chemical burn are displayed. Displayed phrase objects may be ordered based on statistical values associated with each phrase object and presented to a user according to the ordering. Hence phrase objects that are commonly used on the social networking system popular phrase objects or phrase objects with high rates of use may be presented to the user before lesser used phrase objects.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other social networking system users. Users join the social networking system and add connections to other users to which they desire to be connected. Social networking system users may provide information describing themselves such as their age gender geographical location education history employment history and the like. This user provided information acts as personal context information that may be used by the social networking system to recommend groups events other users actions or other content to the user.

In addition to declarative information provided by users the social networking system may also record users actions performed internal to the social networking system and or performed on external systems that communicate with the social networking system. Examples of external systems include third party sites plugins desktops terminals kiosks or other similar systems. The recorded actions are historical or social context information for the user. Examples of user actions include communications with other users sharing content such as photos interactions with content and advertisements responding to a poll attending an event joining a group modifying declarative information or any other suitable action. Examples of data describing recorded actions performed external to the social networking system include websites visited by the user content with which the user interacted and other suitable data. The social networking system may also use other information recorded by the user device or terminal kiosk such as surrounding environment e.g. location temperature humidity ambient noise biometric data e.g. heart rate temperature mood activity voice recognition motion e.g. accelerometer data movement speed shaking detection of other users devices and so forth as part of recorded context information.

By analyzing stored information associated with a user a social networking system may improve the services offered to users. For example information associated with a user allows a social networking system to provide the user with content more likely to be of interest to the user. In various embodiments the social networking system stores information associated with a user in one or more databases to simplify its retrieval.

Traditionally users have been largely restricted to stationary computing devices limiting the social networking system to obtaining information from users during the time when as user is using a stationary computing device. However users are increasingly accessing social networking systems through mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablets. This allows a social networking system to receive a more continuous stream of information from its users. For example users may check in or indicate their current location via a mobile device identify other users proximate to the user comment on actions view content relevant to a store or establishment where the user is located. Additional sensors and functionalities of mobile computing devices such as global positioning systems GPS cameras video cameras voice recorders and other systems further increases the information available to be sent to the social networking system.

Furthermore the portability of mobile devices allows users to connect to and interact with a social networking system from a greater variety of locations than when using a stationary computing device. For example users may compose posts or provide other content to a social networking system while away from home or work using a mobile computing device. As another example users may provide comments while attending an event such as a seminar or a concert. Interacting with the social networking system via a mobile computing device allows users to submit information in near real time which the social networking system may use to modify a dynamic profile of the user for providing more personalized interactions with the social networking system for various users.

However using a mobile computing device to compose posts or other content for communicating to the social networking system is relatively cumbersome for users. For example to generate a post using conventional techniques a user often needs to input a significant number of strokes or button presses to enter the post content. This cumbersome input of multiple characters using small input devices of a mobile computing device may discourage users from social networking system use in part due to the inconvenience of typing a significant number of characters. Some online systems use predictive texting or word suggestions to allow users to provide content while entering a smaller number of characters. However many conventional predictive word suggestions are based on individual words and not phrases. For example conventional predictive word suggestions often generate a list of individual words matching a portion of the input received from a user. However the lists generated by conventional systems typically do not include phrases. Furthermore suggestions provided by conventional systems may often include words with characters in a specific location matching the received input while excluding words with characters in other locations matching the received input. For example when receiving the input cre conventional systems may present cream while not presenting ice cream or chocolate ice cream. To provide a user with more relevant suggestions for input phrase objects comprising objects maintained by the social networking system and including content that matches at least a portion of the received input are identified. For example a phrase object may include content preceding the received input corresponding to an object not previously identified by the received input but that may the user s intended input. In some embodiments phrase object suggestions can be extended to systems outside of the social networking system. For example the phrase object suggestion modules can be incorporated into iframes Connect plugins programs or desktop widgets that can recognize when a user is creating a post outside of the social networking system and provide similar phrase object suggestions in the outside system.

A social networking system may identify phrase objects for suggestion by identifying and extracting objects from previously received content such as posts. Words or objects within a specified distance or proximity of an extracted object may also be identified and grouped with the extracted object to create a phrase object. Analyzing the post or other content from which the phrase object was identified the social networking system may associate context with the phrase object. The extracted phrase object and the context allows the social networking system to categorize the phrase object under a single hub or overarching category for the phrase object. For example a great dinner may be categorized under the dinner hub. In an embodiment the social networking system uses the hub and connected phrase objects in combination with extracted context and statistics associated with the phrase object to generate personalized phrase object suggestions for each user.

Stored data may be used to identify patterns in a user s behavior such as including certain words in posts while in specific situations or places commenting while attending certain events and so forth. Additionally various posts may be analyzed to identify frequencies with which words or other objects are received from users. Stored data may also be used to correlate geographical location tags e.g. current location indicators or location indicators for past posts with objects for possible inclusion in posts. For example if the user was at a restaurant phrase objects associated with restaurants such as eating food drinking tea or waiting in line may be presented. Furthermore phrase objects may be presented to a user so that phrase objects more likely to be selected by the user are prioritized. Phrase objects presented to a user may also be filtered so that phrase objects having less than a threshold likelihood of selection by the user are not presented.

Using stored data describing a user s behavior along with received information describing a user s environment when providing content to the social networking system the combination referred to as context data phrase objects more likely to be selected by the user may be presented. For example when a user accesses an interface to provide content to the social networking system a composer interface the social networking system begins identifying candidate phrase objects for the user based in part on the context information and statistical data. As described above phrase objects may be presented to the user based in part on the previously extracted statistical data. For example phrase objects having the highest frequencies of use by the user or by social networking system users are prioritized for display.

A social networking system may further improve suggestions by using machine learning and modeling to determine patterns in the content provided to the social networking system by a user. As the user submits content e.g. posts comments etc. to the social networking system a database of content provided by the user is generated and may be used to develop basic models on user phrase object choice. These models may be used to identify phrase objects likely to be selected by the user without receiving a significant amount of user inputs. In some embodiments the social networking system may also generate an automatic post using determined phrase object suggestions without having the user type the post based on knowing the user s current context and having a reasonable level of confidence in accuracy.

Client device is a computing device capable of processing data as well as transmitting and receiving data via network . For example client device may be a desktop computer a laptop computer a smart phone a tablet computing device or any other device having computing and data communication capabilities. Client device is coupled to network which may comprise any combination of local area cellular wireless and or terrestrial communication systems.

Users of social networking system may provide data to social networking system using client device and network . In use users join social networking system and add connections to other social networking system users. These connections may reflect connections existing outside of the social networking system or offline relationships between users. Social networking system may provide a user with stories describing actions or content associated with other social networking system users connected to the user.

Users of social networking system may explicitly add or remove connections between themselves and other users and or objects. In addition some connections may be automatically created based on common characteristics between users or between users and objects. For example social networking system may create connections between users from the same educational institution or associated with the same organization. Connections maintained by social networking system are often but not necessarily mutual hence some connections may be unilateral. For example user A and user B are both users of social networking system and connected to each other thus user A and user B have a bilateral connection where each may view information shared by the other user. However user A may establish a connection with user C while user C does not establish a connection to user A. Accordingly a unilateral connection is formed between user A and user C where limited information may be shared between user A and user C. Although connections between users are often direct some connections may be indirect where indirectly connected users are separated by connections to one or more intermediate users also referred to as degrees of separation .

Social networking system allows users to post and share stories describing themselves or their activities. A story may be presented to other users connected to a user posting or sharing the story enhancing user interactions with social networking system . Stories may include any data a user may add upload send transmit or post to social networking system . For example a user uploads a post to social networking system from client device . The post may include textual data e.g. comments status updates notes or links geographic location information photos videos links music or other data.

To compose a post on social networking system users select characters by selecting or inputting characters through an input device of client device . Examples of methods for providing input via client device include selecting characters from a displayed character array typing on an external keyboard drawing characters on a touchscreen display selecting from a list of suggestions or any other suitable technique. Input provided to client device is communicated to social networking system via network and social networking system analyzes the received input to identify phrase objects based on the input.

Social networking system comprises one or more computing devices that store information on a plurality of users objects and connections between users and or objects as well as allow users to interact with each other. In the embodiment illustrated in social networking system includes web server interface generator action logger action log user profile store content store and edge store and phrase object store . Other embodiments of social networking system may have different and or additional components or may include fewer components than those shown in .

Web server links social networking system to client device via network and may link social networking system to one or more third party systems via network . Web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. Web server may receive and route messages between social networking system and client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to web server to upload information for example images or videos that are stored in content store further described below. Additionally web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or RIM .

Interface generator processes data from other components of social networking system and generates an interface that is communicated to a client device . Social networking system users view information from social networking system and provide information to social networking system via one or more interfaces generated by interface generator . For example information describing content presented by an interface and accessed by a user is communicated to social networking system allowing social networking system to maintain a record of content with which the user interacted. In one embodiment interface generated determines the interactions between the client device and users via the interface and processes the interactions into formats used by other components of social networking system .

In one embodiment interface generator generates a composer interface for receiving data describing content from a user for distribution to social networking system users. When a user provides text content for communicating to social networking system such as content for writing posts making comments entering search parameters completing data forms and the like interface generator presents the user with a composer interface for entering text and or other input. For example a user may access the composer interface by interacting with another interface presented by social networking system causing interface generator to present the composer interface. In one embodiment the composer interface is a text entry region such as a text box and other composition related icons and functions. Input received via the composer interface is communicated to social networking system which stores the received input and retrieves context information associated with the user providing the input from one or more of action log user profile store content store and edge store .

Based on the received input and context information interface generator identifies one or more suggested phrase objects for presentation to the user as suggestions. In one embodiment context data is used to augment the interface generator s suggestions by allowing social networking system to identify patterns from content previously received from the user while the user provides input via the composer interface. For example the user may begin typing choc into a textbox and interface generator identifies and presents the phrase object eating chocolate cake and other phrase objects based on context information and phrase objects popularities.

In an embodiment interface generator determines probabilities of the user selecting an identified phrase object when providing input. These probabilities may be used to determine one or more phrase objects presented to the user via the composer interface. For example phrase objects having less than a threshold probability of use are not displayed via the composer interface. The composer interface may display the phrase objects in an order based on their probabilities or may visually distinguish phrase objects having at least a threshold probability from other phrase objects presented to the user.

Action logger receives information about user actions on social networking system as well as actions performed outside of social networking system and records this information in action log . Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user and any other suitable action. In addition a number of actions described in connection with other objects are directed at particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well when stored in action log . Action logger may also receive system information from the device that the user actions took place on such as from terminals kiosks mobile devices computers and the like.

Action log may be used by social networking system to track user actions on social networking system as well as on external systems that communicate information to social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on social networking system including commenting on posts sharing links and checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items or other interactions. Information describing these actions is stored in action log . Additional examples of interactions described by data in action log include commenting on a photo album transmitting communication between users joining an event joining a group becoming a fan of a brand page creating an event authorizing an application using an application and engaging in a transaction. Additionally action log records a user s interactions with advertisements on social networking system as well as other applications operating on social networking system . In some embodiments data from action log is used to infer interests or preferences of the user augmenting the interests included in a user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

Action log may also store user actions taken on external systems. For example an e commerce website that primarily sells sporting equipment at bargain prices may recognize a user of social networking system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the social networking system user. Because users of social networking system are uniquely identifiable third party systems such as this sporting equipment retailer may use the information about these users as they visit their websites. Action log records data about these users including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

Social networking system maintains a user profile for each of its users and stores these user profiles in user profile store . A user profile includes information about the user that the user has provided to social networking system such as biographic demographic work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. However user profiles may also include information inferred by social networking system such as possible interests or connections to additional users. User profiles may also include information that are detected by a device and transmitted to the social networking system such as biometric data or activity data. In one embodiment a user profile includes a plurality of data fields each describing one or more attributes about a corresponding social networking system user. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user such as images videos comments and other stories in which the user has been identified or tagged. A user profile stored in user profile store may also include links to content stored in content store edge store and or action log that is related to the user.

Content store stores objects representing various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photo a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Objects may be created by users of social networking system such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications which may be external to social networking system . Content items represent single pieces of content that are represented as objects in social networking system . Users of social networking system are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media through various communication channels increasing the interaction of users with each other and increasing the frequency with which users interact with social networking system . Stories associated with users are also included in content store . As used herein stories include any type of comments notes status updates links videos pictures and the like. Objects are retrieved from content store to present content to users via an interface or other suitable communication channel.

Edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on social networking system as edges. Some connections may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other connections are generated when users interact with objects in social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system . Edge store may also record the changes in user connections over time. For example when user A establishes a connection with user B edge store includes data identifying the type of connection the time the connection was established and may store other information associated with the connection such as an application or process used to create the connection. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in user profile store content store or either of those stores may access edge store to determine connections between users and other users or objects.

Information describing edges is also stored in edge store such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores may be computed by social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by social networking system over time to approximate a user s likely interest in an object interest and other users of social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In various embodiments multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored in a single edge in edge store or may be stored as multiple edges in edge store .

Phrase object store includes phrase objects for inclusion by social networking system users in content such as posts distributed by social networking system . The phrase objects may be acquired based from phrase objects previously provided to social networking system from one or more social networking system users or based on information from another source e.g. a dictionary or external word bank . In some embodiments phrase object store includes phrases that may be considered as slang to account for contemporary changes in language or online speech. Phrase object store may include words from various languages to allow identification of a wider range of phrase objects. In some embodiments phrase object store is updated at time intervals to add or remove phrase objects. In an embodiment phrase object store may also be optimized for retrieval of stored phrase objects by limiting storage to phrases likely to be used in a social networking system .

As social networking system receives input from a user for inclusion in a post social networking system retrieves context information from one or more of action log user profile store and edge store . For example when social networking system receives input via a composer interface interface generator retrieves context information such as personal social historical geographical temporal biometric device related and similar other information associated with the user providing the input. For example stored context information associated with the user describes actions previously performed by the user and one or more characteristics associated with the user. Context information associated with the user may include content previously provided by the user the user s location the time when the user provides the input input previously provided by the user from the same or a similar location input received from other users at the same or a similar location. Other context associated with the user may include users with the user when the input is received.

Interface generator determines one or more candidate phrase objects based on the received input and the retrieved context associated with the received input and or the user. For example interface generator identifies objects included in or associated with content previously received from the user or included in or associated with other social networking system users. In one embodiment words included in previously received content are identified. Additionally other types of objects such as pictures videos links friends events or groups may be identified from previously received content. When an object is identified additional objects within a threshold distance of the identified object may also be identified and grouped together to form a phrase object. For example the interface generator identifies the word friend as an object and also identifies words within 5 words of friend in at least a threshold amount of content and groups the words into phrase objects such as calling my friend meeting up with a friend friends and family and so forth. Phrase objects may be pre computed offline or be composed on the fly such as for previously unknown phrase objects. Phrase objects are extracted based on parts of speech taggers and topic taggers which matches a phrase object with other related phrase objects. In some embodiments the extraction of phrase objects may depend on many occurrences of the same phrase objects with similar sets of related phrase objects in order to filter out noise or periphery phrase objects. Identified phrase objects are associated with the context of the posts or other content from which they are extracted. For instance the phrase object drinking beer is extracted from a post received from a user while at a bar during the evening so interface generator associates the phrase object with the time and location. Interface generator may determine the number of times various phrase objects have appeared in previously received content e.g. posts received from the user and or in previously received content received from other social networking system users. The frequency with which phrase objects appear in content may be used to determine candidate phrase objects.

In one embodiment interface generator filters phrase objects by comparing the context associated with stored phrase objects to context associated with the received input. For example interface generator discards phrase objects having less than a threshold percentage of attributes of context matching or similar to context associated with the received input. Alternatively interface generator identifies phrase objects having at least a threshold percentage or number of attributes of context matching or similar to context associated with the received input. Identifying candidate phrase objects based on similarity of contexts may increase the likelihood of identifying candidate phrase objects relevant to the received input

From the identified phrase objects one or more candidate phrase objects are determined . For example interface generator determines candidate phrase objects matching at least a portion of the received input and associated with context having a threshold similarity to the context of the received input. Additionally the frequency with which identified phrase objects are selected or provided by the user or by other users of social networking system may be used when determining candidate phrase objects . Any combination of the above identified factors may be used to determine candidate phrase objects.

The candidate phrase objects are ranked based on the likelihood of being selected by the user. In various embodiments the ranking may be based on several factors including the degree of relevance to the received input the frequency with which the user uses a candidate phrase object a candidate phrase object s popularity with social networking system users or any other suitable factor. As another example interface generator identifies a location from the retrieved context and associates a higher probability with phrase objects associated with the identified location. For example if a user is providing input from a movie theater data items relating to movie theaters e.g. movies tickets seats popcorn drinks line wait previews snacks etc. are assigned higher probability values than unrelated to theaters e.g. beach ski winter flying weather paperwork bunny etc. . Candidate phrase objects with higher likelihoods of selection by the user may have a higher position in the ranking. Based on the ranking one or more phrase objects from the candidate phrase objects are selected and presented to the user. In one embodiment candidate phrase objects having at least a threshold likelihood of selection or having the highest likelihoods of selections are visually distinguished when presented. Alternatively the presented candidate phrase objects may be limited to candidate phrase objects having at least a threshold likelihood of selection to more efficiently present information to the user. In various embodiments threshold value may be pre determined e.g. pre set by social networking system operators or dynamic e.g. select only the top five phrase object selections . The user may select a presented phrase object to complete the received input simplifying communication of content to social networking system .

In some embodiments additional data may be associated with phrase objects and presented along with the phrase objects. For example phrase objects may be associated with related images links events sound clips videos or other data. The data associated with the phrase objects are presented along with the phrase objects. For example bathing in hot water and pouring hot water may be phrase object suggestions displayed to a user in response to the user typing water. In the embodiments where images are associated with the phrase object small icons may be displayed next to each phrase object such as an image of a bath tub for bathing in hot water and an image of a teapot for pouring hot water. The images may be retrieved from a set of generic images or retrieved from images associated with the user.

Composer interface is presented to a social networking system user to receive input identifying content for presentation via social networking system such as a post. In one embodiment a virtual keyboard may be displayed instead of suggestions box allowing the user to provide input to composition input box by interacting with the virtual keyboard. As composition input box receives input from the user suggestions box presents one or more phrase objects based on the received input. In some embodiments composition input box may display phrase object suggestions based on high confidence in the suggestions based on detected context information and or previous actions without having received input from the user. The user may select a phrase object from the suggestions box to complete the input or may continue manually providing input which modifies the phrase objects presented in suggestions box . A phrase object selected from suggestions box is presented in composition input box .

In an embodiment title bar provides basic information and options for a composer interface . In the example of title bar includes the name of the user and options to post or cancel the current text entry. Other embodiments may include different information such as the name of social networking system the name of the recipient if the post is on another user s page the time the location the type of post and so forth. Title bar may also include different features for interacting with composer interface such as text field options font and size changes attachment options program manipulation options and so forth. Title bar may be located in different portions of the display in various embodiments.

Composition input box or the text field displays text corresponding to input received from the user or corresponding to phrase objects selected by the user. Before receiving input from a user composition input box may include a blank screen a blinking line indicating a text entry location a faded prompt e.g. What s on your mind or Enter text here or any other suitable content. As input such as characters is received composition input box is updated to display the received input. Other modifications to the content of the composition input box such as shifting the blinking line to follow the text entry may be performed as input is received. In some embodiments composition input box includes data in addition to input received form a user. For example shows composition input box including a small image of the user providing input. Other embodiments may include a brief summary of the user e.g. name and age reminders e.g. current time or location option buttons e.g. icons for adding attachments to the post icons for attaching metadata to the post editing options and the like or other suitable information.

In some embodiments composition input box may change in size and provide different functionality based on the amount of input received and on the size of the other data displayed by composer interface . For example if the user provides an amount of input exceeding the default size of composition input box the size of composition input box may increase and encroach on the space in which suggestions box is typically presented. In another embodiment a scroll bar may appear in composition input box allowing a user to scroll through received input without affecting other content presented by composition input box . In addition composition input box may be reduced in size if less than a threshold amount of input is received or if interface generator determines display of phrase objects improves user interaction with social networking system .

Suggestions box displays phrase objects selected by social networking system for selection by a user. As input is received the phrase objects presented by suggestions box are modified. Each portion of input provided by the user refines the phrase objects that a user may be inputting allowing interface generator to refine the phrase objects displayed in suggestions box . For example in response to the user s typing Eating ice interface generator displays suggested phrase objects such as ice cream chocolate ice cream vanilla ice cream delicious ice cream ice cream sundae and ice cream cake based on completion of the ice portion of the input. However if the user continues and types Eating ice c interface generator may update suggestions box to also display ice cubes. 

In an embodiment the size of suggestions box may dynamically change based on the number of phrase objects identified by interface generator . For example suggestions box may decrease in size to allow for presentation of a virtual keyboard when less than a threshold number of phrase objects are identified. As another example if greater than a specified number of phrase objects are identified suggestions box may alter the font size with which phrase objects are displayed display a scroll button for navigating a scrollable list of phrase objects. Additional data such as images may be associated with phrase objects and displayed along with the displayed phrase objects. For example associated images may be shown as icons proximate to their corresponding phrase object to allow users to quickly differentiate between different phrase objects. For example the chocolate ice cream suggestion in may be displayed along with a small icon of chocolate flavored ice cream.

In some embodiments such as example of display space may be limited. To conserve space less frequently used features and selections may be reduced to smaller icons or removed from display. For example an on screen keyboard may be displayed when interface generator identifies less than a minimum number of phrase objects for display. However as additional input is received interface generator identifies an increased number of phrase objects for display so a virtual keyboard is reduced to a keyboard button to increase the display space available for displaying phrase objects. If a user does not find a phrase object associated with the received input the user may retrieve the virtual keyboard by accessing keyboard button . Scroll button may allow users to view additional phrase objects than those initially displayed by suggestions box by updating the phrase objects displayed by suggestions box .

Interface generator retrieves content stored by social networking system such as from content store action log or any other suitable source. In an embodiment the content is retrieved in response to receiving a command from a user. The commands may be explicit e.g. user activates the phrase object extraction operations or implicit e.g. user sets interface generator to periodically update the store of phrase objects user begins typing a new post the existing phrase objects store is outdated . In an embodiment the retrieved content is associated with a user providing input to social networking system . For example the retrieved data are posts comments and notes written by the user. In another embodiment the retrieved content may be associated with users of the social networking system in addition to the user providing input.

Interface generator identifies objects associated with or identified with various stored content. For example interface generator identifies objects associated with various stored posts of content. As discussed above objects may include textual data visual data or auditory data. Interface generator may identify specific objects as candidates for phrase objects based in part on one or more factors. Examples of factors include a list of key objects text rules grammatical rules frequency of usage word length or other suitable factors. For example candidate objects that interface generator may identify from a post by a user specifying I am going to eat chocolate ice cream with Jim are eat chocolate ice cream and Jim. In an embodiment Jim may be associated with a specific additional user to which the user is connected so the identified object is the user Jim rather than the word Jim. Non textual objects such as pictures or videos may be identified as objects associated with the post. For example the user may have posted a picture of the chocolate ice cream along with the preceding example sentence so the picture may also be identified as an object.

After identifying the candidate objects in a post interface generator identifies additional objects within a specified distance or having a specified relationship to an identified object. These additional objects are associated with the candidate objects. The candidate object and one or more of the additional objects are grouped into a phrase object that is extracted from the content. For example a phrase object that is extracted from a post. In an embodiment various text rules or grammar rules are applied to content from which a candidate object is retrieved to identify a phrase object. For example in the previously mentioned example I am going to eat chocolate ice cream with Jim the word chocolate may be used to form the phrase object chocolate ice cream. Multiple phrase objects may be formed from a single candidate object. For example the word chocolate is used to form the phrase objects eat chocolate and eat chocolate ice cream. Pictures of chocolate ice cream associated with the post e.g. a picture of a chocolate ice cream attached to the post may be included in a phrase object including chocolate. In some embodiments text rules may identify chocolate as descriptor in the example sentence and identify ice cream as the candidate object with possible phrase objects of chocolate ice cream eat ice cream ice cream with Jim etc.

The phrase objects extracted from the stored content are stored . Stored phrase objects may be indexed to expedite subsequent analysis and retrieval of phrase objects. Phrase objects may be indexed based on objects included in the phrase objects. For example the phrase object chocolate ice cream may be indexed under chocolate ice cream or any combination thereof when a word under which a phrase object is indexed is received interface generator may retrieve the stored phrase objects including at least one of the words.

In various embodiments interface generator orders phrase objects presented to a user. For example presented phrase objects are ordered in part by their popularity or frequency of usage. Accordingly interface generator analyzes statistics associated with stored phrase objects. For example interface generator determines the number of times a phrase object is extracted from content associated with a user determines the number of times a phrase object appears on social networking system determines a rate at which a phrase object is used in an interval of time or any other suitable criteria. Other statistics may be determined such as the probability that user will select a phrase object a percentage of posts including a phrase object a percentage or number of social networking system users including a phrase object or other suitable statistics. For example interface generator may determine that a user frequently tends to use the phrase chocolate ice cream . Thus when the user begins to type choco the interface generator may prioritize chocolate ice cream over other phrases such as chocolate cake chocolate bar chocolate candy or chocolate Easter eggs .

In addition to statistical information interface generator may also analyze context information associated with stored phrase objects. Contextual information associated with a phrase object may include a location associated with content from which the phrase object was extracted a time associated with content from which the phrase object was extracted additional users associated with content from which the phrase object was extracted other content received from a location associated with the content from which the phrase object was extracted or other suitable information. Interface generator may identify specific information or attributes from the context associated with a phrase object such as associated users temporal information geographical location metadata type of content received feedback or other suitable information. Statistics and context information associated with phrase objects may be used to generate a predictive model associated with a user indicating the likelihood of the user selecting various phrase objects. For example when interface generator detects that the user is in an ice cream store the interface generator may prioritize chocolate ice cream . However the interface generator may prioritize chocolate bar when Halloween is approaching or when the user is typing in a candy store.

The analyzed statistics and extracted context are stored as metadata associated with the corresponding phrase object. Alternatively the statistics and the context are stored using an indexing system linking the statistics and content with the corresponding phrase object. As described above when content is received from a user interface generator determines phrase objects for presentation by comparing the received input and context information associated with the received input with stored phrase objects and statistics and or context associated with stored phrase objects.

In some embodiments phrase objects may be associated with social networking system users through sentiment analysis. When a user includes a phrase object in content shared via social networking system interface generator may establish an edge between the phrase object and the user shown in by the connections between user friend and friend with Pumpkin Latte . Sentiment analysis determines key characteristics about the established edge through indicators such as related descriptors e.g. adjectives verbs modifiers and the like key words e.g. like love hate dislike and so forth or user actions feedback on the post e.g. indicating a like commenting positively or negatively sharing the post and so forth . Interface generator uses sentiment analysis to determine how the user feels about a phrase object such as with positive emotions negative emotions various degrees of emotions and so forth. For example user and friend both use the phrase object Pumpkin Latte in posts. Through sentiment analysis of these posts interface generator determines that there are no key words or indications that these have a particular feeling towards the latte and connects these users to the Pumpkin Latte node through a neutral term such as drink. However sentiment analysis may indicate that friend has a preference for pumpkin lattes so interface generator connects friend to the Pumpkin Latte node via an edge having a like indicator.

In some embodiments interface generator does not associate an indicator with edges between nodes when no user sentiment is identified. Alternatively interface generator may associate a neutral indicator with a connection between nodes when no user sentiment is identified. Indicators may be associated with edges connecting phrase objects with non user objects in some embodiments. For example interface generator uses sentiment analysis to determine sentiments for a phrase object based on the general usage of the phrase object on the social networking system . For example at least a threshold number of users may comment about drinking lattes or indicate a preference for drinking lattes. Accordingly interface generator may associate a like indicator to an edge connecting phrase object Drink Latte and Latte . Sentiment analysis results may be used when ranking phrase objects.

In an embodiment phrase objects may be associated with related media content such as images videos or audio. These media content may be objects represented by nodes connected to phrase objects by edges. For example in photo and photo are both connected to Great Tasting latte by edges. Edges connecting media content to a phrase object may be labeled to indicate the relationship between the phrase object and the media content. Interface generator may use labeling of edges to retrieve appropriate images or other content to present. Media content associated with phrase objects may be from publically available content or may be retrieved from a specified user. Restricted media content may be associated with a corresponding phrase object for presentation along with a phrase object to selected users but not presented to other users. Hence content presented along with phrase objects may be modified by privacy settings for different social networking system users.

In some embodiments phrase objects may be media content. Hence interface generator may present phrase objects comprising media content. For example when a user inputs drink latte interface generator may determine that the user is likely referring to Great Tasting Latte and present photo as a phrase object. Likewise interface generator may present photo if the user inputs saw a latte. Media content may include a user s personal media content media content publically available on social networking system or a combination thereof. Personal media content may be retrieved if one or more keywords are received such as my. For example if a user inputs my bike interface generator retrieves and presents an image of the user s bicycle as a phrase object.

In some embodiments advertisers or other third parties may compensate social networking system to present media content presented as a phrase object. For example an advertiser provides social networking system with compensation so that an image is included in the phrase objects presented to a user. For example an advertiser may compensate social networking system to display an image of a particular beverage brand as a phrase object when a user provides input for a post associated with soda such as drinking a soda.
