This invention was made with Government support under contract number W911QY 11 P 0135 awarded by U.S Army NATICK Contracting Division. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates generally to articles made from or incorporating fabrics and more particularly to such fabric based articles having controllable fluid permeability.

The permeability of most fabrics and fabric based articles to fluid passage is set during manufacturing. Parameters such as the materials from which the fabric is made the weave density and pattern and the general structure such as holes formed in the fabric control its permeability. However certain articles may benefit from the ability to dynamically control such permeability. By way of example parachutes sails filters and aircrafts may all benefit from the ability to control the rate at which fluid passes therethrough.

Attempts at providing variable permeability in fabrics have been made for various purposes. By way of example U.S. Pat. No. 3 222 016 discloses a variable permeability fabric for a parachute. U.S. Pat. No. 5 115 582 discloses a spiral fabric papermaker belt having adjustable permeability. U.S. Pat. No. 7 820 571 discloses a fabric exhibiting reversibly changeable air permeability responsive to humidity. In US 2008 0254263 Yausi et al. disclose a composite fabric material exhibiting three dimensional structural change upon water absorption.

In these specifications the terms variable permeability and controlled permeability and the varied inflictions of those terms are also used interchangeably. A fabric based article should be construed to mean an article which is primarily made of fabric regardless if other materials are incorporated in the article or if the fabric article is incorporated within another article and modifies the permeability of the article in which it is incorporated.

Methods of controlling fabric permeability are generally broadly divided between two main categories referred to herein as geometric permeability and weave permeability. Controlled weave permeability is determined by the weave of the fabric and its finish. Weave permeability modifies either the pore size between adjacent strands or changes the shape or geometry of the weave of the fabric itself. In contrast variable geometric permeability involves changing the geometry of a fabric based article as a whole. Therefore changes to the general shape or more commonly opening or by closing of holes slots and other voids of various shapes within the fabric article change the permeability of the article as a whole. In geometric permeability the openings are generally significantly larger than the distance between adjacent strands of the fabric. Thus while variable geometric permeability relates to the permeability of the fabric based article variable weave permeability relates to changes in the permeability of the fabric itself regardless of the article in which it is used.

Changes in geometrical permeability may effect the weave permeability and vice versa. Modifying the permeability of the fabric itself effects the permeability of the fabric based article as a whole but the weave based variable permeability deals firstly with the permeability of the fabric. Similarly in many instances deforming the fabric to open or close a void may also cause change in the fabric weave. However the effects of those weave changes are minor relative to the change in permeability caused by opening or closing of voids or otherwise changing the geometry of the fabric. Clearly these specifications and the claims should be construed to extend to combinations of such variable permeability types.

Shape Memory Alloys commonly known as SMA are well known in the art. SMA are materials that tend to have a phase change which is induced by environmental factors to which the material is exposed such as temperature electromagnetic fields electric currents and the like. An object made of SMA material is initially formed into a parent shape by machining heat treatment and other metalwork techniques. The object may then be manipulated deformed bent stretched and the like and would generally maintain the shape to which it is manipulated. However once exposed to specific known conditions the material goes through the phase change and resumes the parent shape in a process known as shape memory transformation . Certain SMAs are capable of memorizing two shapes one for high temperature and the other for low temperature or for two states of the known conditions. A common SMA material is known in its commercial name NITINOL Nickel Titanium Naval ordinance Laboratory however the invention is not limited to use of any specific material.

Certain medical applications of SMA are directed at forming a medical device such as stents filters and the like which are either made of SMA materials or are based on its operation. Generally those devices are based on forming a structure comprising SMA material and shaping it into substantially a parent shape. The material is then deformed and placed in a body cavity such as a blood vessel intestinal or urinary tract and the like. Placement occurs by different means but generally a catheter is a common tool used to insert the device into its position in the body and the SMA allows a relatively large structure to be positioned by a much smaller catheter. Examples of such applications are described by way of example in US2007 0135834 to Clubb et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7 367 985 to Mazzocchi et al. and in US2008 0228028 to Carlsom et al. Certain devices utilize the body temperature to transition the SMA base object to a desired shape once inside a desired location in a human body.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 164 339 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 192 994 both to Greenhalgh disclose a method of manufacturing a woven textile having a structural member integrally woven therein. The structural member comprises a wire which is trained to undergo a shape memory transformation. The straight wire is inserted into the fabric during manufacturing and is transformed back to an undulating shape thereafter. Greenlhlag is directed to creating a combined stent graft structure for repair of a body tube in a living body. It is noted that the above examples are designed for forming a device and shaping it to a temporary shape utilizing various combinations of temperature pressure and the like and then allowing it to get back to its original shape once deployed. That action is expected to take place only once in the useful life of the device. The above devices do not take advantage of the SMA ability to repeatedly move from one state to another responsive to repeated heating and cooling thereof.

In US 2004 0183283 Buckman et al. disclose a personal air bag inflation device which optionally utilizes garments fabricated from fibers that are highly flexible in their unactivated state such as Nitinol. Following activation these fibers become more rigid and provide additional impact penetration and skid protection. The nitinol shape memory elements may be comprised of nanofabricated or micromachined into the cloth of the garment. Activation of the microscopic nitinol shape memory elements by applying electricity to the elements causes them to change shape to stiffen the fabric or cloth of the garment.

SMA actuators are known whereby electrical current is passed in a wire made of SMA material. The resulting temperature change causes the wire to contract or expand proportionally to the amount of current. Such wires act as fast light weight and relatively high powered actuators. In most cases the actuators may be continuously adjusted between a relaxed state and a fully activated state Control of fabric permeability while fabric based articles are being used provides special advantages that are oftentimes specific to the application at hand. Thus by way of example changing the air permeability of a fabric used in a parachute offers better control of the opening speed and shock the decent rate and landing speed of the parachute as well as controlling oscillations possibly changing direction of the descent and the like. Providing a boat sail with controlled air permeability allows optimizing the sail shape to current conditions such as wind strength and direction allowing spilling of air from the sail at desired areas may act as a substitute to reefing the sail and the like. Filters made by utilizing variable permeability offer the ability of changing the particle size which they filter and optionally offer a cleaning method of the filter by changing the pore size at selected times.

There is therefore a clear and heretofore unanswered need for materials and methods to dynamically change the fluid permeability of a fabric in a controlled manner as well as for articles utilizing such materials and methods.

The objects of various aspects of the present invention are to resolve the shortcomings of the known art.

In its most general form the invention provides for varying the fabric fluid permeability by controlling at least one SMA based actuator. The SMA actuator may operate by changing the geometric permeability or by modifying the weave permeability of the fabric based article or a portion or portions thereof. The actuator is preferably controlled by electric currents passing therethrough but may also be controlled by modifying the temperature or providing electromagnetic fields to which the SMA actuator is exposed.

It is often desired that only portions of the fabric based article have the capacity to change permeability. An area with variable permeability within a larger article shall be referred to as a valve hereinunder. A valve may be formed utilizing either geometric variable permeability or weave variable permeability and a single article may comprise one or more valves in any combination of types. Valves may be formed by SMA actuators anchored directly or indirectly to the fabric the SMA may engulf a portion of the fabric or may be incorporated into the weave of the fabric. Some valves comprise voids in the fabric which are changed by applying forces to the fabric or by moving blocking structure across voids to selectively modify the fluid flow through such voids.

The actuator comprises a coiled SMA wire or wires. The coiled SMA actuator forms an important aspect in many embodiments of the present invention as it offers large gains in the dynamic range of the SMA actuator as compared to a straight SMA wire. Further preferably the actuator is coated by protective material such as silicon rubber and the like.

Optionally temperature protection may be provided to the SMA and surrounding structure. Such control may be achieved by controlling the current through the actuator such as by controlling the voltage or the duty cycle. Optionally mechanical interrupters such as fuses circuit breakers resettable thermostats switches and the like are provided to limit the temperature by interrupting the current through the SMA actuator. In certain embodiments the expansion or contraction of the SMA itself may be used to control the temperature.

Various aspects of the present invention provide for numerous methods of geometrical based and or weave based permeability control and for combinations thereof.

In certain embodiments the SMA actuators operate directly on the fabric and in others the actuators operate by controlling voids via intermediate materials that adhere to the fabric or otherwise are attached thereto. By way of non limiting example intermediate material may be a silicon rubber latex or other rubbery substance adhered to the fabric pins sections of fabric which act as a shutter an activating string a spring and the like.

Other aspects of the invention include different uses enabled by various controlled fluid permeability fabric. By way of example such uses include incorporating the controlled permeability fabric in parachutes sails and filters as described below.

In its simplest embodiment the present invention utilizes a SMA actuator to modify the fluid permeability of a fabric based article. Preferably the SMA actuator takes the form of a wire or a coil as shown in but in certain embodiments not shown the actuator may take other shapes such as a rod a disc a spiral and the like by way of non limiting example.

It was found that forming the SMA into a coil provides unforeseen and unobvious advantages by providing longer actuator strokes. In some embodiments the ratio of expansion and or contraction of a coiled SMA wire is tenfold or higher than the that of a straight wire SMA according to the selected materials and the coil geometry. The coil based actuator may further provide changes in other dimensions due to it geometry.

Portion depicts a coiled SMA wire coated with heat shielding material such as silicon or siliconized rubber polymers such as polyurethane latex and the like. The heat shield coating is provided to protect the fabric from excessive temperature caused by the heating of the SMA. In certain embodiments it is also desired to insulate the wire from the environment to prevent short circuiting the actuator or otherwise transferring charge to the ambient environment. Insulation may be combined with the heat shield as is done by way of example by using siliconized rubber or provided separately. depicts a closer view of the encapsulation of the SMA coiled wire within such heat shield and or insulating material.

The protecting sleeve provides further advantages where it prevents the coiled SMA from tangling or interfering with itself or other items in its environment. Furthermore a rigid or substantially rigid sleeve imparts greater linearity to the actuator. If utilized as a yarn within a fabric the sleeved SMA coil may more readily be weaved like other yarns and will protect the SMA from tangling with the rest of the fabric as it is activated.

Preferably the actuator is activated by passing electric current therethrough which causes the actuator to heat due to the electrical resistance thereof. It is noted that alternative methods of causing actuation are also considered such as exposing the actuator to electromagnetic or magnetic fields supplying heat energy from sources other than the heat caused by passing current through the wire and the like.

In the relaxed state slot is covered by lips and . One end of each of actuators and is anchored to the fabric article and the other end to lips and respectively. In the relaxed state lips and are close to each other and preferably overlap to limit fluid flow through slot as seen in . As seen in when both actuators are activated the slot opens and fluid flow increases. Partial activation and or activation of one or both actuators offers various rates of permeability.

It is important to note that in embodiments which use two or more separate actuators the actuators may be operated simultaneously or separately to obtain more precise control of the fluid flow. Furthermore it is noted that in most embodiments proportional control of one or more valves may be obtained by controlling the amount of current flowing through the actuator.

Similarly to and and represent respective views of yet another normally closed valve embodiment. In this embodiment slot is covered by gate . Actuator is either embedded within or otherwise coupled to gate so as to twist reduce width or otherwise remove portions of the gate from registration or overlapping of slot as seen in . Removing the gate from the slot in whole or in parts increases fluid flow through the valve.

Certain embodiments may be designed so as to offer an easy selection of the valve type between normally open or normally closed types. are cutoff side view and is an elevation view of one exemplary embodiment of this type. In this embodiment fluid flow rate is controlled by selectively covering and uncovering all or a portion of a number of slots disposed within the fabric . In the shown embodiment a plurality of holes is formed in fabric. A SMA actuator moves a gate with matching holes across the fabric to selectively cover or uncover the holes therein. The holes in the gate and in the fabric may be of any desired shape or size and the holes in the fabric and in the gate may be of different numbers sizes and shapes as long as the desired functionality of the gate to adjust or stop the fluid flow through the fabric holes responsive to actuator activation is achieved. While the gate may be created from any material in preferred embodiments it is made of fabric or a thin and generally flexible material. A cover layer is provided to hold the gate and forms a guide pocket or rail to guide the gate along the desired path across the holes in the fabric. depicts the valve in its closed state as the gate covers the fabric holes while depicts the valve in its open state as the gate holes and the fabric holes are in substantial registration. In certain embodiments the gate is urged back into a relaxed state and the relative location of the fabric and gate holes define the type of such valve as normally open or normally closed. Optionally a second actuator is provided to move the gate in a direction opposite to the direction in which actuator moves it. Thus the gate may be selectively situated in at least two states but preferably also in any desired flow rate between the closed and open states by energizing the appropriate actuator to desired level. While shows the optional second actuator depicts yet another embodiment where a spring is utilized to urge the gate against actuator . It is noted that in some embodiments fluid pressure may be utilized to urge the gate to a relaxed state not shown 

In light of the example embodiments for various types of valves provided above the skilled in the art would recognize different variations may be employed for constructing such valves. Embodiments that include plurality of holes and or slots placing the SMA in other yarn either as a part of the weave or embedding the SMA in the yarn to modify the base fabric weave upon the activation of the SMA. Further embodiments may utilize different geometrical solutions utilization of different gates made from fabric or other materials such as plastic paper cardboard or even light metals.

Another aspect of the present invention involves dynamically changing the porosity of a parachute. The term parachute should be construed to extend to fabric based air brake paraglider parawing drogue chute ram air parachute and the like. depicts a parachute having at least one SMA actuator based valve but preferably a plurality of valves embedded in several locations within the canopy. The valves may be located in one or more gores in the case of a round parachute as shown in and different combinations of valve types may be utilized. The skilled in the art would readily recognize that valves may similarly be incorporated in cruciform parachutes ram airfoil parachutes drogues and the like. The valves may be used for adjusting the opening shock controlling the rate of descent oscillation prevention and or directional control. The power source for controlling the SMA actuators may be carried by the parachutists or the cargo being parachuted however in an optional embodiment the power source for individual valves may be attached thereto. A controller not shown measuring acceleration altitude above the terrain and the like may be utilized to automatically adjust the porosity of the parachute according to the desired conditions at any point during the parachute drop.

It is important to note that the term permeability relates to any fluid and is not limited to any specific gas or liquid.

The term SMA incorporates herein as an acronym the term alloy. However it is noted that certain shape memory materials are not necessary metals. Shape memory polymers are also known and the term SMA should be construed to extend to all such materials which exhibit shape memory.

In these specifications the term relaxed when relating to the state of the SMA actuator relates to un energized actuator while active relates to an actuator which receives sufficient energy to cause change in the permeability of the fabric or the fabric article. The term Stroke as it relates to an actuator depicts the total change in at least one dimension of the actuator which is commonly the longitudinal dimension. However expansion and contraction in other dimensions are also considered either in a single dimension or in combinations thereof. By way of example an actuator lengthwise change may be accompanied by thickness change as well. It is further noted that an actuator may be formed to either expand or contract

The term coil is not limited to a round coil but extends to other geometrical shapes such as square triangular or any other geometrical shape. The term coil should also extend to a substantially flat two dimensional arrangement of a coil of any desired shape such as to a round elliptical serpentine zigzag square and the like.

It is further noted that the voids in the fabric such as slots holes slits and the like may be partially obstructed and in fact are oftentimes partially obstructed even in their open state by the SMA material or by other structure which forms the valves and similarly that the valves described herein do not necessarily shut all fluid flow but rather reduce or increase fluid flow thorough their effective area in response to the control that is applied to the actuator.

Certain portions of the valves described herein comprise fabric as well as other materials which may be attached to the fabric such as coatings anchors and the like. Similarly gates may comprise fabric and or other materials such as plastic metal and the like.

The SMA actuators may be incorporated into any type of fabric including by way of example fabrics made from nylon p aramid polyester etc. The fabrics can be woven non woven or a combination of materials.

It will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to what has been described hereinabove merely by way of example. While there have been described what are at present considered to be the preferred embodiments of this invention it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other embodiments changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention and that it is therefore aimed to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention for which letters patent is applied.
