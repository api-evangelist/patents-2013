This invention was made at least in part with U.S. government support under U.S. Air Force contract No. FA8650 12 M 2249. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The field of the invention is electrochemistry. The devices and systems of this invention are applicable for example to the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into useful products.

There is a present need to decrease carbon dioxide CO emissions from industrial facilities. Over the years a number of electrochemical processes have been suggested for the conversion of COinto useful products. Processes for COconversion and the catalysts for them are discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 959 094 4 240 882 4 349 464 4 523 981 4 545 872 4 595 465 4 608 132 4 608 133 4 609 440 4 609 441 4 609 451 4 620 906 4 668 349 4 673 473 4 711 708 4 756 807 4 818 353 5 064 733 5 284 563 5 382 332 5 457 079 5 709 789 5 928 806 5 952 540 6 024 855 6 660 680 6 664 207 6 987 134 the 134 patent 7 157 404 7 378 561 7 479 570 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0223727 the 727 application and papers reviewed by Hori Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry 42 pages 89 189 2008 the Hori Review Gattrell et al. Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 594 pages 1 19 2006 the Gattrell review and DuBois Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry 7a pages 202 225 2006 the DuBois review .

Generally an electrochemical cell contains an anode a cathode and an electrolyte as indicated in . Catalysts are placed on the anode and or cathode and or in the electrolyte to promote desired chemical reactions. During operation reactants or a solution containing reactants is fed into the cell. Then a voltage is applied between the anode and the cathode to promote an electrochemical reaction.

When an electrochemical cell is used as a COconversion system a reactant comprising CO carbonate or bicarbonate is fed into the cell. A voltage is applied to the cell and the COreacts to form new chemical compounds. Examples of cathode reactions in the Hori Review include CO 2 2H CO HO 2CO 2 CO CO CO HO 2 CO 2OH CO 2HO 4 HCO 3OH CO 2HO 2 HCO 2OH CO HO 2 HCO OH CO 2HO 2 HCO 2OH CO 5HO 6 CHOH 6OH CO 6HO 8 CH 8OH 2CO 8HO 12 CH 12OH 2CO 9HO 12 CHCHOH 12OH 2CO 6HO 8 CHCOOH 8OH 2CO 5HO 8 CHCOO 7OH 2CO 10HO 14 CH 14OH CO 2H 2 CO HO acetic acid oxalic acid oxylate CO 4H 4 CHO where eis an electron. The examples given above are merely illustrative and are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible cathode reactions.

Examples of reactions on the anode mentioned in the Hori Review include 2O O 4 2CO O 2CO 4 4OH O 2HO 4 2HO O 4H 4 The examples given above are merely illustrative and are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible anode reactions.

In the previous literature catalysts comprising one or more of V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Sn Zr Nb Mo Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd Hf Ta W Re Ir Pt Au Hg Al Si In Sn Tl Pb Bi Sb Te U Sm Tb La Ce and Nd have all shown activity for COconversion. Reviews include Hori Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry 42 pages 89 189 2008 the Hori Review Gattrell et al. Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 594 pages 1 19 2006 the Gattrell review DuBois Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry 7a pages 202 225 2006 the DuBois review and the papers Li et al. Journal of Applied Electrochemistry 36 pages 1105 1115 2006 Li et al. Journal of Applied Electrochemistry 37 pages 1107 1117 2007 and Oloman et al. ChemSusChem 1 pages 385 391 2008 the Li and Oloman papers and references therein.

The results in the Hori Review show that the conversion of COis only mildly affected by solvent unless the solvent also acts as a reactant. Water can act like a reactant so reactions in water are different than reactions in non aqueous solutions. But the reactions are the same in most non aqueous solvents and importantly the overpotentials are almost the same in water and in the non aqueous solvents.

The catalysts have been in the form of either bulk materials supported particles collections of particles small metal ions or organometallics.

Co owned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12 830 338 and 13 174 365 as well as International Application Nos. PCT US2011 030098 and PCT US2011 042809 disclose a catalyst mixture comprising an active metal and a Helper Catalyst capable of catalyzing COconversions with low overpotential and high electron conversion efficiency. However the catalysts disclosed in these patent applications showed a lower activity than was desired.

The examples above consider applications for COconversion but the present electrochemical device overcomes limitations of other systems. For example some commercial COsensors use an electrochemical reaction to detect the presence of CO. At present these sensors require over 1 5 watts of power which is too high for portable sensing applications.

An electrochemical device converts COinto other chemical reaction products. The pH at a point near the cathode catalyst is between 1.1 and 5.5 so that the device can overcome one or more of the limitations of low rates high overpotentials and low electron conversion efficiencies namely selectivities low rates for catalytic reactions and high power for sensors.

The device includes an electrochemical cell containing an anode a cathode and an electrolyte as indicated in . Catalysts are placed on the anode and or cathode and or in the electrolyte to promote desired chemical reactions. There can be different electrolytes on different sides of a divided cell.

The electrolytes can be liquids solids or gels. The device can be in the form of a membrane electrode assembly a single or dual compartment cell or other design. The system can also include a catalytically active element a Helper Catalyst a hydrogen suppressor or other component.

Important to the design is the use of either an electrolyte Helper Catalyst liquid solution solid or Functional Unit near the cathode with a Moderate Acidity. The electrolyte Helper Catalyst or Helper Catalyst solution can be in the form of a solid electrolyte liquid electrolyte or a gel.

The device can also include any of i a catalytically active metal ii a separating membrane iii a Helper Catalyst iv a solid membrane between the anode and cathode v gas diffusion layers vi channels for gas and or liquid flow and vii a stack of several electrochemical cells.

The experiment used the flow cell described in Rosen et al. Science 334 pages 643 644 2011. It was a sandwich style reactor in which there were two liquid channels containing the catholyte and anolyte and one COgas channel. The gas channel was made of aluminum and was also the cathodic current collector. Just below the cathodic current collector was a piece of graphite gas diffusion layer available from SGL Carbon LLC Charlotte N.C. USA under the trade designation SIGRACET in which 10 mg of silver nanoparticles were made into an ink and painted onto an area of 1.5 cm. The ink was made by mixing 10 mg of silver nanopowder 100 nm diameter Aldrich with 600 l of 18.2 ultra pure water 600 l of isopropyl alcohol and 10 l of a 5 solution of 1100EW perfluorosulfonic acid polymer available under the trade designation NAFION from DuPont Wilmington Del. This mixture was then sonicated for 2 min. The platinum anode ink was made the exact same way except using high surface area platinum black nanoparticles Alfa Aesar in lieu of silver. Below the cathode was a liquid channel made of fluoropolymer available under the trade designation TEFLON DuPont in which the ionic liquid mixtures could come in contact with the cathode. Below the top liquid channel was a 2 cmpiece of NAFION 117 membrane DuPont . Below the membrane is the lower liquid channel where 0.1 M HSOpassed over the anode. The gas channel exit was connected to an SRI Gas Chromatograph SRI Instruments Torrance Calif. USA equipped with a 6 foot Molecular Sieve 5A column and a thermal conductivity detector TCD . The column was kept at 100 C. while the detector was at 110 C. The gas chromatograph GC utilized a helium carrier gas with a flow rate of 25 sccm.

During the experiments 5 ml min of mixtures of EMIM BF4 and water or EMIM BF4 and 0.5 M HSOwere fed into the cathode liquid channel and 5 ml min of 0.1 M HSOwas fed into the anode liquid channel. The cathode was held at 0.7 V with respect to SHE. 5 sccm of COwas fed into the gas channel and the rates of CO and hydrogen production were measured with the GC.

It is useful to put the results in into the context of the literature. The Hori Review teaches that COconversion catalysts work best when the solution is near neutral namely pH 6 7 . According to the Hori Review The hydrogen reduction reaction HER is prevalent particularly in acidic solutions whereas COmolecules do not exist in a basic solution . Consequently the Hori Review notes most of COreduction studies were done with neutral electrolyte solutions namely pH 7 . The pH changes to when COis absorbed.

The data in shows that in the presence of ionic liquids solutions with a pH of 6 7 are not preferred. Instead the optimal pH is between 1.1 and 5.5.

It was also noted that fresh EMIM BF4 water solutions show a pH near 7. The pH is in the optimal range only when aged solutions are used. Another unexpected finding in the data in is that when water was added the CO production efficiency increased and no significant hydrogen formation was observed. By comparison Tomita et al. Journal of the Electrochemical Society 147 pages 4164 4167 2000 examined the effects of water additions on COelectrolysis in acetonitrile water mixtures and found that they could observe significant hydrogen formation when as little as 0.01 moles liter of water is added to a dry acetonitrile solution. Hydrogen formation dominates at water concentrations of 1 moles liter or more. Here little hydrogen formation was found when the water concentration is about 25 moles liter and significant hydrogen formation was only observed at water concentrations above 30 moles liter. Interestingly about the same amount of hydrogen was produced at a water concentration of 37 moles liter as Tomita et al. reported at a water concentration of 0.03 moles liter. Clearly the EMIM BF4 can inhibit hydrogen formation.

Tests were also performed in an electrochemical cell. The experiments were conducted in a custom made three electrode electrochemical cell described in Rosen et al. The Journal of Physical Chemistry C 116 pages 15307 15312 2012 . The working electrodes were 

During the experiment EMIM BF4 was mixed with 0.001 M sulfuric acid to produce a mixture with a known pH. The mixture was loaded in the cell and sparged with argon to remove any residual CO. Then the potential of the working electrode was held constant at 1.2 1.3 1.4 and 1.5 V with respect to the Ag QRE and the current was recorded as a function of time. Generally the current showed a rapid decrease in the first few seconds reaching a steady state value in 5 to 10 seconds. The average steady state value over the next 2 minutes was recorded. Next the solution was saturated with COand a second steady state value was recorded. The current due to COconversion namely the difference between the current in the presence and absence of CO was then calculated.

Again it should be noted that the Hori Review suggests that the optimal pH for COconversion is between 6 and 7. The data in shows that in the presence of ionic liquids solutions with a pH of 6 7 are not preferred. Instead the optimal pH for COconversion on silver is between 2.2 and 4.

The objective of this example is to demonstrate that the present electrochemical device also operates with a platinum catalyst. The experiments were conducted in a custom made three electrode electrochemical cell described in Rosen et al. The Journal of Physical Chemistry C 116 pages 15307 15312 2012 . Prior to sparging any gases into an electrochemical cell the gases were sent through a tube of Drierite anhydrous calcium sulfate W.A. Hammond Drierite Co. Ltd. in order to remove any residual moisture present in the gas streams. Working electrodes were high surface area platinum black Alfa Aesar supported on a 5 mm diameter platinum slug. The counter electrode was made of a 25 25 mm piece of platinum gauze purchased through Alfa Aesar. The gauze was connected to a 5 inch 12.7 cm long 0.5 mm diameter platinum wire. The reference electrode was an Ag 0.01 M Agnon aqueous reference electrode BASi Bioanalytical Systems Inc. West Lafayette Ind. USA . The reference electrode was calibrated using the Ferrocene Ferrocene couple as an internal standard. During the experiments a Solartron SI 1287 potentiostat Solartron Analytical Oak Ridge Tenn. USA was used to hold the potential of the working electrode constant at 0.7 V with respect to SHE for 5 minutes then the potential was raised at 10 mV min and the area of the CO stripping peak associated with COconversion to CO was measured.

The examples above used liquid solutions but in some applications one might want membrane electrode assemblies MEAs instead. shows a possible structure of the MEA. It includes a cathode a cathode catalyst Buffer Layer that is Moderately Acidic an ionomer membrane an anode catalyst and an anode . The objective of this example is to determine whether such a structure would be active for COconversion.

The MEA was constructed using a SIGRACET graphite gas diffusion layer cathode. 10 mg of silver nanoparticles were made into an ink and painted onto an area of 1.5 cmon the cathode as described in Example 1. Next a Buffer Layer was constructed by saturating a paper towel with a 50 50 mixture by volume of EMIM Cl and water. Third a NAFION 117 membrane coated with 3M platinum NSTF catalyst on one side was obtained from 3M Company St. Paul Minn. USA. It served as the proton transfer membrane and the anode catalyst. A SIGRACET graphite gas diffusion layer anode was added as the anode and the parts were sandwiched together to form an MEA. The liquid channels were removed from the flow cell used to take the data in Example 1 and the MEA was mounted in the cell. A potential of 2.5 V was applied to the cell and the current was measured with either nitrogen or CObeing fed to the cathode at 5 sccm.

The results in show that the device with a MEA similar to that in with a Moderately Acidic Buffer Layer is also useful as a component in a sensor since the current is different in COand in N.
