The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.

The invention relates generally to fastener systems and more particularly to a quick release collapsible bolt apparatus and method.

In general the typical torque nut removal process involves two wrenches one on the nut and one on the bolt working in opposition. In a twisting motion the nut is ratcheted off the bolt and through a series of twists and 360 degree spins the nut is eventually removed from the bolt. This is a time consuming process particularly if there is a change from one configuration to another requiring disassembly and subsequent reassembly.

Recreational and work structures of some types are frequently torn down for movement to a new location. When many connections are utilized a great deal of time could be saved if it were not required to undo each nut and bolt connection using the process discussed above.

Further there are many situations in which time is of the essence when conducting maintenance repair and assembly applications including disaster response military operations and various other contingency operations. It is therefore desirable that the ability to remove parts and hardware assemblies from one another be effected in a rapid manner especially during combat operations in which personnel may be exposed to extreme hazards while performing this work.

The present invention comprises a new and improved quick release collapsible bolt that allows for clamping and fastening parts together in a conventional nut and bolt arrangement while providing an improved release mechanism not requiring a traditional twisting or torquing of the nut and bolt with respect to each other. Accordingly those of skill in the art will appreciate the present invention which addresses the above discussed problems.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a quick release collapsible bolt having a conventional manner to engage a fastener assembly while providing an improved faster removal process for the fastener.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a quick release collapsible bolt providing for a pull to release a central core element of a multi part segmented bolt that collapses the sections to allow immediate removal of the bolt.

Still another object of the invention is to provide a quick release collapsible bolt and method which allows for a rapid means to release a nut and bolt from each other.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein by way of illustration and example an embodiment of the present invention is disclosed. However it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above and or other objects of the invention.

In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a quick release collapsible bolt is disclosed which may comprise a plurality of bolt segments each of the plurality of bolt segments comprising a bolt head portion and a threaded portion. The plurality of bolt segments are positioned adjacent to each other so that the threaded portion and bolt head portion of each of the plurality of bolt segments are in an aligned position whereupon a receptacle is centrally formed between the plurality of bolt segments.

The quick release collapsible bolt may further comprise a center core comprising an elongate portion that extends into the receptacle through the bolt head portion and into the threaded portion of each of the plurality of bolt segments to support the plurality of bolt segments in the aligned position. The center core is removable from the bolt head portion whereupon the plurality of bolt segments are collapsible inwardly towards the receptacle.

In one embodiment the elongate portion of the central core is tapered from a larger diameter near the bolt head portion to a smaller diameter within the plurality of bolt segments. The elongate portion of the central core may be substantially conical or frustoconical. In another embodiment the elongate portion has a circular circumference.

In one embodiment the quick release collapsible bolt further comprises an opening in the bolt head portion and a fastener is insertable into the opening. The fastener is operable to hold the plurality of bolt segments and the center core together. In this embodiment the fastener and the central core are removable in two steps 1 the fastener is removed and 2 the central core is removed whereupon the plurality of bolt segments are collapsible inwardly towards the receptacle.

In yet another embodiment a ball detent interconnection between the plurality of bolt segments and the center core may be operable to maintain the center core within the plurality of bolt segments. A removal force sufficient to overcome resistance of the ball detent interconnection permits a one step removal of the central core whereupon the plurality of bolt segments are collapsible inwardly towards the receptacle. To assist in removing the central core the central core may comprise a handle adjacent the bolt head portion.

In one embodiment the central core may comprise radially extending segments that fit between the bolt head portion of each of the plurality of bolt segments.

In another embodiment the central core extends through an entire length of the threaded portion of each of the plurality of bolt segments.

In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention quick release collapsible bolt is shown in the FIGURE. In this embodiment quick release collapsible bolt comprises segmented bolt quadrants and center core when fully assembled. Each bolt quadrant comprises a threaded portion as indicated at and a head portion as indicated at . Interfaces and are shown on the threaded portion between quadrants of collapsible bolt . For example interface is an interface between the threaded portion of the bolt quadrants which are referred to in the FIGURE as A and A and correspond to bolt quadrants and .

While four quadrants are utilized in this embodiment other numbers of bolt segments could be utilized rather than four quadrants depending on the bolt size. When assembled quick release collapsible bolt is in the form of a standard bolt with a bolt head portion and a threaded shaft portion that may be utilized with a standard nut or socket not shown .

Center core has a tapered elongate section indicated at interface between core and a rounded internal receptacle portion which extends longitudinally between core and an interior of bolt quadrants and . In other words each bolt quadrant comprises an internal rounded receptacle portion which engages core along interface which is the same shape to receive center core . In this embodiment interface between each bolt quadrant and core is conical or frustoconical. However other shapes could be used. While the preferred embodiment of interface or shaft of center core is conical or rounded other shapes for center core and internal surfaces of the bolt quadrants might be utilized such as a tapered square or the like. Moreover a taper is the preferred embodiment for reasons discussed hereinafter but a straight cylinder or square might also be utilized.

Center core supports the four threaded bolt quadrants and pushes the quadrants outwardly so that the bolt quadrants take the shape of a standard bolt. Center core preferably extends through the length of collapsible bolt . Center core may also comprise nut head spacers and if desired or may simply comprise the tapered section without spacers in head portion . Each of the four bolt quadrants and are threaded with the desired threads and fit together so that threads are continuous as on a standard bolt. The type of threads may be selected so that once a nut is started on the assembled collapsible bolt then any slight discrepancies in alignment of the thread will be reduced or eliminated. However threads may be selected as desired and may be coarse or fine. Accordingly when the bolt quadrants are placed in an aligned position in which there may be slight discrepancies the threads are still sufficiently aligned to screw into a nut.

For storage prior to use collapsible bolt may be wrapped in Teflon tape. If desired the Teflon tape may be left in place during installation. In another embodiment collapsible bolt may be held together with cotter pin that may be utilized in hole or hole or other holes as desired. The holes for cotter pin are preferably formed in bolt head . Use of cotter pin or if desired more than one cotter pin to hold the bolt components together creates an additional step in the removal process but may be more convenient for holding the quick release bolt components together. Other means for holding the threads together might comprise plastic thread protector material plastic sockets or the like.

In another embodiment when cotter pin is not used then rounded or ball shaped elements may engage receptacles or detents such as and to hold the components in the desired alignment position so that the threads are aligned to be continuous or sufficiently continuous prior to starting the nut so that the nut will screw on as discussed hereinbefore.

In one embodiment the taper of interface between center core and the interior of the bolt quadrants effectively creates a net upward and outward force when quick release collapsible bolt is fully assembled. Center core may be lubricated or pre lubricated to facilitate sliding between the parts in the removal process if desired. The interior surfaces of the bolt quadrants may smoothly engage center core . Thus the taper enhances the ease of removing center core by creating a force that enhances removal of core .

Handle or a tab or the like may be provided at the top of core which can be grabbed quickly with a pair of pliers or the like as discussed below for removal.

In operation the assembled bolt is threaded through holes in the parts that are to be held together and a conventional nut is spun into place. Tightening the nut bolt pair happens in conventional fashion and the parts are held together. The quick release removal operation is quite simple. In one embodiment which requires two steps cotter pin is released with a pair of pliers and then center core is pulled out in the direction of the axis of center core as indicated by force arrow F as shown. This allows bolt quadrants and to collapse inward disengaging the threads of the nut and allows all fastener elements to be rapidly removed and the parts separated.

In the one step removal method where the fastener is not utilized then central core is pulled out in the same manner. In this method due to the detent ball connection a predetermined removal force F must be exceeded to effect extraction. Accordingly the bolt and nut are held securely together until the specified removal force F is applied. The detent ball connection may be spring loaded to provide for the predetermined force required for removal.

In summary collapsible nut is installed like a typical bolt. For quick removal center core is pulled out either with a sufficient force if used by first removing pin . The four quadrants and then collapse into the opening created after removal of center core .

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
