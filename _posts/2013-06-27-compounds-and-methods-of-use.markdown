Apoptosis is now recognized as an essential biological process for tissue homeostasis of all living species. In mammals in particular it has been shown to regulate early embryonic development. Later in life cell death is a default mechanism by which potentially dangerous cells e.g. cells carrying cancerous defects are removed. Several apoptotic pathways have been uncovered and one of the most important involves the Bcl 2 family of proteins which are key regulators of the mitochondrial also called intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. See Danial N. N. and Korsmeyer S. J. 2004 116 205 219. The structural homology domains BH1 BH2 BH3 and BH4 are characteristic of this family of proteins. The Bcl 2 family of proteins can be further classified into three subfamilies depending on how many of the homology domains each protein contains and on its biological activity i.e. whether it has pro or anti apoptotic function .

The first subgroup contains proteins having all 4 homology domains i.e. BH1 BH2 BH3 and BH4. Their general effect is anti apoptotic that is to preserve a cell from starting a cell death process. Proteins such as for example. Bcl 2 Bcl w Bcl x Mcl 1 and Bfl 1 A1 are members of this first subgroup. Proteins belonging to the second subgroup contain the three homology domains BH1 BH2 and BH3 and have a pro apoptotic effect. The two main representative proteins of this second subgroup are Bax and Bak. Finally the third subgroup is composed of proteins containing only the BH3 domain and members of this subgroup are usually referred to as BH3 only proteins. Their biological effect on the cell is pro apoptotic. Bim Bid Bad Bik Noxa Hrk Bmf and Puma are examples of this third subfamily of proteins. The exact mechanism by which the Bcl 2 family proteins regulate cell death is still not entirely known and understanding this mechanism is an active area of research in the science community. In one hypothesis of regulation of cell death by Bcl 2 family proteins the BH3 only proteins are further categorized as either activator e.g. Bim and Bid or sensitizer e.g. Bad Bik Noxa Hrk Bmf and Puma proteins depending on their regulatory function.

The key to tissue homeostasis is achieving the delicate balance in the interactions among the three subgroups of protein in cells. Recent studies have tried to elucidate the mechanisms by which pro apoptotic and anti apoptotic subgroups of Bcl 2 family proteins interact to allow a cell to undergo programmed cell death. After receiving intra or extra cellular signals in cells post translational or transcriptional activation of BH3 only proteins occurs. The BH3 only proteins are the primary inducers of an apoptotic cascade that includes as one step the activation of the pro apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak on the mitochondrial membrane in cells. Upon activation of Bax and or Bak that are either already anchored to the mitochondrial membrane or migrate to this membrane Bax and or Bak oligomerize to result in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP the release of cytochrome C and downstream activation of effector caspases to ultimately result in cell apoptosis. Some researchers hypothesize that certain BH3 only proteins e.g. Puma Bim Bid are activators in that these proteins directly engage pro apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak to initiate MOMP while other BH3 only proteins e.g. Bad Bik and Noxa are sensitizers and induce Bax and Bak oligomerization indirectly by binding anti apoptotic proteins e.g. Bcl 2 Bcl x Bcl w Mcl 1 and displacing and freeing up the activator BH3 only proteins which subsequently bind to and activate pro apoptotic proteins e.g. Bax Bak to induce cell death. Other researchers suggest that anti apoptotic proteins engage and seqeuester Bax and Bak directly and all BH3 only proteins regulates this interaction by binding to anti apoptotic proteins e.g. Bcl 2 Bcl x Bcl w Mcl 1 which results in the release Bax and Bak. See Adams J. M. and Cory S. 2007 26 1324 1337 Willis S. N. et al. 2007 315 856 859. Although the exact interactions through which the anti and pro apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins regulate apoptosis remain under debate there is a large body of scientific evidence to show that compounds which inhibit the binding of BH3 only proteins to anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins promote apoptosis in cells.

Dysregulated apoptotic pathways have been implicated in the pathology of many significant diseases such as neurodegenerative conditions up regulated apoptosis such as for example. Alzheimer s disease and proliferative diseases down regulated apoptosis such as for example cancer autoimmune diseases and pro thrombotic conditions.

In one aspect the implication that down regulated apoptosis and more particularly the Bcl 2 family of proteins is involved in the onset of cancerous malignancy has revealed a novel way of targeting this still elusive disease. Research has shown for example the anti apoptotic proteins Bcl 2 and Bcl x are overexpressed in many cancer cell types. See. Zhang J. Y. 2002 1 101 Kirkin V. et al. 2004 1644 229 249 and Amundson S. A. et al. 2000 60 6101 6110. The effect of this deregulation is the survival of altered cells which would otherwise have undergone apoptosis in normal conditions. The repetition of these defects associated with unregulated proliferation is thought to be the starting point of cancerous evolution. Additionally research has shown that BH3 only proteins can act as tumor suppressors when expressed in diseased animals.

These findings as well as numerous others have made possible the emergence of new strategies in drug discovery for targeting cancer If a small molecule that could mimic the effect of BH3 only proteins were able to enter the cell and overcome the anti apoptotic protein over expression then it could be possible to reset the apoptotic process. This strategy can have the advantage that it can alleviate the problem of drug resistance which is usually a consequence of apoptotic deregulation abnormal survival .

Researchers also have demonstrated that platelets also contain the necessary apoptotic machinery e.g. Bax Bak Bcl Bcl 2 cytochrome c caspase 9 caspase 3 and APAF 1 to execute programmed cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although circulating platelet production is a normal physiological process a number of diseases are caused or exacerbated by excess of or undesired activation of platelets. The above suggests that therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting anti apoptotic proteins in platelets and reducing the number of platelets in mammals maybe useful in treating pro thrombotic conditions and diseases that are characterized by an excess of or undesired activation of platelets.

Abbott Laboratories Inc. has developed a class of small molecule BH3 only protein mimetics. i.e. ABT 737 and ABT 263 that bind strongly to a subset of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins including Bcl 2 Bcl w and Bcl x but only weakly to Mcl 1 and A1 and exhibits mechanism based cytotoxicity. These compounds were tested in animal studies and demonstrated cytotoxic activity in certain xenograft models as single agents as well as enhanced the effects of a number of chemotherapeutic agents on other xenograft models when used in combination. See Tse C. et al. 2008 68 3421 3428 and van Delft M. F. et al. 2006 10 389 399. These in vivo studies suggest the potential utility of inhibitors of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins for the treatment of diseases that involve a dysregulated apoptotic pathway.

The natural expression levels of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins members vary in different cell types. For example in young platelets Bcl xprotein is highly expressed and plays an important role in regulating cell death life span of platelets. Also in certain cancer cell types the cancer cell s survival is attributed to the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway caused by the over expression of one or more anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein family members. In view of the important role for Bcl 2 family of proteins in regulating apoptosis in both cancerous and normal i.e. non cancerous cells and the recognized inter cell type variability of Bcl 2 family protein expression it is advantageous to have a small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets and preferably binds to one type or a subset of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein s for example to an anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family member that overexpressed in a certain cancer type. Such a selective compound also may confer certain advantages in the clinical setting by providing for example the flexibility to select a dosing regimen a reduced on target toxic effect in normal cells among others e.g. lymphopenia has been observed in Bcl 2 deficient mice . See Nakayama K. et al. 1994 91 3700 3704.

In view of the above there is a need in the art for small molecules therapeutics that can selectively inhibit the activity of one type or a subset of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins for example of a Bcl xanti apoptotic protein. The present invention fulfills at least this need.

The term composition as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts as well as any product which results directly or indirectly from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By pharmaceutically acceptable it is meant the carrier diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.

In order to use a compound of this invention for the therapeutic treatment including prophylactic treatment of a patient it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. A typical pharmaceutical composition is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates waxes water soluble and or swellable polymers hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials gelatin oils solvents water and the like. The particular carrier diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which a compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe GRAS to be administered to a mammal. In general safe solvents are non toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water ethanol propylene glycol polyethylene glycols e.g. PEG 400. PEG 300 etc. and mixtures thereof.

In one embodiment a compound of the invention e.g. compound of Formula I or stereoisomer geometric isomer tautomer solvate metabolite or pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug thereof is used as an anticancer agent or as an adjunct agent for the treatment of cancer in a combination therapy. One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether or not a candidate compound treats a cancerous condition for any particular cell type either alone or in combination. Within certain aspects of this embodiment compounds of the invention are used in adjunct with other therapies including conventional surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer.

Such therapies can include one or more of the following categories of anti cancer agents alkylating agents angiogenesis inhibitors antibodies antimetabolites antimitotics antiproliferatives aurora kinase inhibitors apoptosis promoters for example Bcl xL Bcl w and Bfl 1 inhibitors activators of death receptor pathway. Bcr Abl kinase inhibitors BiTE Bi Specific T cell Engager antibodies biologic response modifiers cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors cell cycle inhibitors cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors dual variable domains binding proteins DVDs leukemia viral oncogene homolog ErbB2 receptor inhibitors growth factor inhibitors heat shock protein HSP 90 inhibitors histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors hormonal therapies immunologicals inhibitors of apoptosis proteins IAPs intercalating antibiotics kinase inhibitors mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors microRNA s mitogen activated extracellular signal regulated kinase inhibitors multivalent binding proteins non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs poly ADP adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase PARP inhibitors platinum chemotherapeutics polo like kinase Plk inhibitors proteosome inhibitors purine analogs pyrimidine analogs receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors retinoids deltoids plant alkaloids small inhibitory ribonucleic acids siRNAs topoisomerase inhibitors combinations thereof and the like.

BiTE antibodies are bi specific antibodies that direct T cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab Micromet MT201 blinatumomab Micromet MT103 and the like. Without being limited by theory one of the mechanisms by which T cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard Bcl 2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl 2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T cells when targeted to cancer cells V. R. Sutton D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani 1997 J. of Immunology. 158 12 5783 .

SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity but rather impart increased stability and or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups 2 deoxynucleotide 2 OCH containing ribonucleotides 2 F ribonucleotides 2 methoxyethyl ribonucleotides combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths e.g. 10 200 bps and structures e.g. hairpins single double strands bulges nicks gaps mismatches and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing.

Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term multispecific binding protein means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain DVD binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific i.e. capable of binding one antigen or multispecific i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens . DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig s. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide a light chain DVD polypeptide and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.

The measurement of competition of compounds of the invention with F Bak for a Bcl 2 family protein Bcl x binding site using a Time Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer TR FRET Binding Assay 

Test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO starting at 50 M 2 starting concentration 10 DMSO and 10 L transferred into a 384 well plate. Then 10 L of a protein probe antibody mix is added to each well at final concentrations listed in Table 2.

The samples are then mixed on a shaker for 1 minute then incubated for an additional 2 hours at room temperature. For each assay plate a probe antibody and protein antibody probe mixture were included as a negative and a positive control respectively. Fluorescence was measured on the Envision Perkin Elmer using a 340 35 nm excitation filter and 520 525 F Bak and 495 510 nm Tb labeled anti his antibody emission filters. Dissociation constants K were determined using Wang s equation see Wang Z. X. . FEBS Lett. 1995 360 111 114 . The TR FRET assay can be performed in the presence of varying concentrations of human serum HS or fetal bovine serum FBS .

For comparison the measurement of the competition of compounds of the invention for other Bcl 2 family protein binding sites e.g. Bcl 2 Mcl 1 using the TR FRET binding assay was accomplish by substituting GST Bcl xin the TR FRET assay with other GST labeled protein e.g. GST Bcl 2 GST Mcl 1 prepared in house.

In one embodiment compounds of the invention selectively inhibit the Bcl 2 family protein Bcl xover other Bcl 2 family proteins such as Bcl 2 and Mcl 1. For comparison data Kin micromolar from the measurement of the competition by certain compounds of the invention i.e. compounds 1 28 38 63 71 75 80 81 92 and 94 in Table 1 with F Bak for the Bcl 2 binding site using the TR FRET binding assay are 1.2 0.15 0.01 0.018 0.50 0.272 0.167 0.66 0.23 and 0.000003 respectively.

The measurement of competition of compounds of the invention with Bim26 mer for a Bcl 2 family protein binding site using an Alpha Screen Bcl xBinding Assay 

The BH3 proteins ALPHASCREEN assay was used to identify active small molecules Bcl 2 family protein screen. e.g. Bcl x hmMcl 1 screen. To determine an accurate estimation of the IC the compounds were routinely tested at starting concentrations 100 M and or 1 M and serially titrated 3 fold over 11 dilutions.

The assay uses ALPHASCREEN technology that relies on hydrogel coated acceptor and donor beads which have functional groups for conjugation to a protein e.g. GST hmMcl 1 GST Bcl xL or GST Biotin and a peptide Biotin Bak Biotin Bim respectively. The beads come in close proximity when the protein and the peptides interact. Donor beads contain a photosensitiser that converts oxygen to an excited form of Oat an excitation of 680 nm. Energy is transformed from the singlet oxygen and reacts with chemiluminescers on the acceptor bead resulting in light emission at 520 620 nm. Compounds of the invention when added to the reaction can reduce the intensity of the luminescence dependent on the inhibition of proximity of the acceptor and donor beads. With this information the ICof each compound was calculated

GST Bcl xL GST hmMcl 1 and biotinylated GST proteins were prepared in house and were stored as stock solutions at 80 C. The biotinylated Bak and biotinylated Bim peptides were purchased from Auspep and were stored as 500 M stock solutions in 100 DMSO at 80 C. The ALPHASCREEN GST Glutathione S Transferase Detection Kit was obtained from Perkin Elmer Lifesciences Cat 6760603R . The Proxiplates white 384 well flat Bottom plates were purchased from Interpath Services Melbourne Cat 784075 . The seals to cover the plates were purchased from Proscience. Melbourne Cat 784075 . DMSO was purchased from AnalaR. The 384 deep well plates and the Polypropylene 50 L V bottom polypropylene compound plates were purchased from Matrical.

Compounds of the invention were prepared as 10 mM stocks with 100 DMSO on the day prior to performing the assay. 12 L of 100 DMSO and 6 L of 10 mM compound i.e. 3.333 mM final 100 M was added to columns 1 and 12 in the Polypropylene 50 L V bottom compound plates. To achieve a final compound concentration of 1 M in a separate matrical plate 28 L of 100 DMSO and 2 L of 10 mM compound was added to a well mixed well. 2 L of this solution was taken and added to 38 L of 100 DMSO. 20 L of this solution was added to the test matrical plate. Several control compounds were included in the test plates. For the control wells 15 L 100 DMSO only was added to the appropriate wells of each plate. The compound plates were then serially diluted 2 fold using the MiniTrak. Once titrations were complete the compound plate was immediately covered with a foil seal to prevent evaporation.

The assay and bead buffers were prepared fresh. Each titrated compound plate was assayed in duplicate. The following volumes were sufficient to run 12 Proxiplates 4 assay plates run in duplicate in each of Bclxl hmMcl and counter assays 

ICvalues were obtained by non linear least squares fitting of the above data. e.g. to XLfit3 equation 205 y A B A 1 C x D .

The quality of the assay results were monitored by determination of the Z Prime factor for each assay plate where Z Prime 0.5 for the results was considered as reliable Zhang et al J Biomol Screening 4 67 73 1999 .

The efficacy of the compounds of the present invention can also be determined in cell based killing assays using a variety of cell lines and mouse tumor models. For example their activity on cell viability can be assessed on a panel of cultured tumorigenic and non tumorigenic cell lines as well as primary mouse or human cell populations. In one exemplary set of conditions 5 000 20 000 cells are cultured at 37 C. and 10 COin appropriate growth media e.g. 100 L Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum asparaginase and 2 mercaptoethanol in the case of pre B E Myc mouse tumors in 96 well plates. Cell viability and total cell numbers can be monitored after several hours to several days of incubation with 1 nM 100 M of the compounds to identify those that kill at EC

Neutralization of both Bcl 1 and Mcl 1 anti apoptotic proteins in normal cells is required before a cell undergoes apoptosis via the downstream Bax Bak pathway See Chen. L. et al. 2005 17 393 403 Willis S. N. et al. . 2005 19 1294 1305. A compound that only targets Bcl xshould not affect normal cells but could kill certain cancer cells if they rely more on Bcl xand less on other anti apoptotic proteins e.g. Mcl 1 for survival. To mirror this compounds of the invention were tested for its effect on survival of wild type wt mouse embryo fibroblasts MEFs Bax Bak double knockout BB DKO MEFs MEFs that expressed Noxa and MEFs that expressed Bad. Noxa specifically neutralizes Mcl 1. Hence. MEFs that express Noxa mirror cancer cell types that are reliant on Bcl xfor survival and should be much more sensitive to killing by a Bcl xtargeting compound than MEFs where both Bcl xand Mcl 1 are protective.

In this assay Mcl 1cells were used to confirm that cell apoptosis in the presence of BH3 mimetic small molecules was due to predominantly Bcl xinactivation. This inactivation leaves Bax Bak unconstrained and results in apoptosis. The CELLTITER GLO Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a homogeneous method of determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present. The amount of ATP correlates with the presence of metabolically active cells such that following cell lysis the amount of ATP present is proportional to the amount of luminescence measured.

Mcl 1mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs are an adherent cell line prepared in house. MEFs were grown in Iwaki 75 cmtissue culture flasks cat 3123 075 with FMA media which consists of 

FMA was stored at 4 C. and used at 37 C. MEFs were cultured in FMA media and harvested in MT PBS and trypsin. For MEF cell viability assays cells were seeded separately in plates with 10 FCS FMA and 1 FCS FMA.

Assays were performed using white flat clear bottom Greiner 384 well tissue culture grade Interpath 781098 plates. The compounds were made up in Matrical 384 well 25 l V bottomed plates cat MP101 2 PP sealed with aluminium foil from Beckman Coulter cat 538619 and stored at 12 C. overnight. Compound preparation and titrations were performed in AnalaR grade DMSO Merck cat 1.02952.2500 . The cell viability detection assay used was CELLTITRE GLO which is commercially available from Promega cat G7572 stored at 20 C. and used at 37 C.

Automated Systems that can be used in this assay include 1 Multidrop The MULTIDROP 384 ThermoLabsystems dispenser was used to dispense cells aseptically into the assay plates 2 MiniTrak The MINITRAK system from Perkin Elmer was used for titration of the compound plates 3 Zymark The ZYMARK SCICLONE ALH3000 System with 100 nL pintool head was used for compound addition to the cells 4 EnVision The ENVISION plate reader was used to measure the viability via the detection of the luminescence.

Compounds of the invention were prepared as 10 mM solution in 100 DMSO and stored at 20 C. Compounds were thawed to room temperature and dispensed into a 384 well Matrical plate. Standard control compounds e.g. 32.3 mM Etoposide were added to the plate as controls.

The plates can be sealed with foil seals and stored at 12 C. overnight. The compound plates were left to thaw at room temperature and the compounds titrated 1 3 in 100 DMSO on the MiniTrak see methods section below day 3 .

The media was aspirated and the Mcl 1cells washed with 10 mls of warmed MT PBS. MT PBS was aspirated and 1 ml of trypsin was added. The T75 flasks were incubated at 37 C. until the cells became detached. 4 ml of 10 FCS FMA media was added to the trypsinized cells and the entire volume was transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 250 g. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml of 10 FCS FMA. 3 ml of this cell suspension was added to a clean 75 cmflask containing 17 ml of 10 FCS FMA media thus performing a 3 10 split. The remaining cell suspension was used to perform a 1 50 split into another 75 cmflask for further culturing.

Cells were harvested as per method step 1 and the pellet resuspended in 3 mls 10 FCS FMA. Cell number was determined by counting in a Neubauer hacmocytometer and the dilution calculated to achieve a density of 1 10cells ml 500 cells per well in 50 l media . Separate dilutions were prepared in 50 ml 10 FCS FMA and 50 ml 1 FCS FMA solutions respectively.

Four assay plates were set up per compound plate. Two 384 well plates containing Mcl 1cells in 10 FCS FMA and the other two plates containing Mcl 1cells in 1 FCS FMA.

Using the Multidrop 25 l cells were dispensed aseptically into all 384 wells of the assay plates. Plates were left to rest in a non stacked layer at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes minimizes edge effects and then were placed as a single layer in the 37 C. incubator. The plates were left to incubate overnight.

The compound plates were titrated by performing a 3 fold 11 point dilution series using 100 DMSO on the MiniTrak. Following titration of the compounds 100 nl of compounds were added to the cell plates using the Zymark Sciclone Pintool. This was a 1 250 dilution of the compound so the highest final concentration of compound was 40 M. The plates were then returned to 37 C. incubator and left to incubate overnight.

The CELLTITRE GLO solution was prepared according to the manufacturer s instructions by the reconstitution of CELLTITRE GLO Substrate with CELLTITRE GLO Buffer and stored after use at 80 C. Plates were removed from incubator and left to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 mins. 25 l of diluted CELLTITRE GLO was added to each well of the assay plates using the Multidrop. The plates were mixed on a plate shaker for 15 mins before being read on the Envision using the luminescence protocol.

ICvalues were obtained by non linear least squares fitting of the data of the data using e.g. the 4 parameter logistic fit XLFit 4 eqn 205 y A B A 1 C x D .

The quality of the assay results were monitored by determination of the Z factor for each assay plate where Z 0.5 for the results was considered as robust Zhang et al. J Biomol Screening 4 67 73 1999 .
