The present invention relates to communication devices and more particularly to a communication device that reads external device information from an external device using proximity wireless communication and transmits the external device information to a server connected via a general purpose network.

In recent years services provided via the Internet have been increasingly prevalent. As servers manage text information images videos and the like created by users as well as news weather forecast movie information and other contents created by companies services for supplying these contents any time via the Internet have also been rapidly increased.

One of the services is photograph sharing service. A user can upload photographs taken by the user himself herself to a server and later view the photographed images any time by accessing the server from a personal computer or the like via the Internet.

In order to upload photographed images to a server products have recently been developed to facilitate the uploading procedure. Digital cameras memory cards and the like have wireless LAN function to automatically upload photographed images directly to a server by simple procedures.

On the other hand in order to download and display images uploaded to a server the following television sets hereinafter TVs are currently on the market. The TVs are connectable to the Internet. A user uses such a TV to access a server and logins with for example a user ID and a password thereby obtaining images from the server.

However the downloading procedures still use conventional interface techniques of personal computers. Therefore the operability is not improved. The TVs with Internet function which are recently on the market require pressing buttons of a remote controller some dozens times to download data such as photographs. A user needs to read a manual to follow the complicated procedures. This would not be a high obstacle for young generations and those having high computer skills. However such procedures requiring relatively high skills are complicated and bothersome for middle aged and elderly people and general women. Users not familiar with computer operations find difficult to enjoy the services. The problem in operability has been examined to be improved but the improved techniques are not different from the conventional computer operation methods. The operability is not significantly improved.

Patent Reference 1 discloses the following technique. A display device connected to a server has a Radio Frequency IDentification RF ID reader. An object commodity merchandise or the like is provided with a RF ID tag including a non rewritable memory in which object Unique IDentification UID is stored. A server has a database in which the object ID UID is associated with an image such as a user s face photograph. When the object is brought to proximity of the RF ID reader the RF ID reader reads the UID from the tag and the image such as a user s face photograph associated with the UID is retrieved from the database to be displayed on the display device. Thereby the owner of the object is determined.

As described earlier the system for providing the photograph sharing service by using a TV has a problem. Since a TV is generally operated by a remote controller it is quite bothersome to access a server and to enter a user ID and a password.

Patent Reference 1 discloses that the display device having a RF ID reader and an object provided with a RF ID tag make it possible to easily display image data such as a face photograph of an owner of the object. However the RF ID tag merely holding UID does not exchange information to facilitate access between the TV terminal and the server. The RF ID tag fails to facilitate the operation procedures. Since a RF ID tag provided to an object holds only UID it is not possible to obtain image information associated with UID when each object is connected to a different server.

In addition the above described Patent Reference 1 has another problem. The TV terminal needs to hold various different application programs programs for downloading images for example compliant to various items item kinds or application systems of the objects provided with RF ID. Therefore the TV terminal needs a storage device to store these various application programs. Moreover it is burdensome to follow version up of the programs.

The present invention addresses the above described problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a communication device capable of simplifying various settings of an object external device .

In accordance with an aspect of the present invention for achieving the object there is provided a communication device that transmits external device information to a server via a network the external device information being received from an external device by using proximity wireless communication.

The communication device includes an antenna unit for the proximity wireless communication with the external device a proximity wireless communication unit configured to communicate with the external device via said antenna unit to receive the external device information from the external device an external device storage unit configured to store the external device information received by said proximity wireless communication unit a registration information generation unit configured to generate registration information based on a the external device information stored in said external device storage unit and b communication device information including communication device identification information for identifying said communication device the registration information being information to be registered in a database in the server and a server communication unit configured to transmit the registration information to the server via the network.

Thereby it is possible to implement a communication device capable of simplifying various settings of an object external device . For example the above structure is useful when a user of the external device intends to register information of the external device to a server or the like hereinafter the registration is also referred to also as user registration or product registration by a single operation using the communication device such as a mobile device.

It should be noted that the present invention can be implemented not only as the device but also as an integrated circuit including the units in the device a method including steps performed by the units in the device a program causing a computer to execute the steps and information data or signals indicating the program. The program information data and signals can be distributed by a recording medium such as a Compact Disc Read Only Memory CD ROM or a communication medium such as the Internet.

The present invention can implement a communication device capable of simplifying various settings of an object external device .

The following describes communication devices according to embodiments of the present invention in detail with reference to the drawings. In the following first to thirteenth embodiments various aspects of the communication device according to the present invention are described. Among them the eighth embodiment is the most preferred embodiment directly related to the primary aspect of the present invention.

The first embodiment according to the present invention is described below. is a schematic diagram of the first embodiment of the present invention. Here a communication system including an image capturing device camera a TV and a server is illustrated. In the image capturing device capturing images is illustrated on a left hand side while the image capturing device reproducing the captured images is illustrated on a right hand side.

The image capturing device is an example of the communication device according to the aspect of the present invention. Here the image capturing device is implemented as a digital camera. For units used in capturing images the image capturing device includes a first power supply unit a video processing unit a first antenna a first processing unit a second memory and a RF ID antenna second antenna . The second memory holds medium identification information captured image state information and server specific information . The RF ID antenna is used for a RF ID unit. For units used in reproducing images the image capturing device includes the first power supply unit a first memory a power detection unit an activation unit the second memory a second processing unit a modulation switch unit a communication unit a second power supply unit and the RF ID antenna . The second memory holds medium identification information captured image state information and the server specific information .

The TV is an example of an apparatus device connected to a reader via a communication path. In more detail the TV is a television receiving apparatus used to display image data captured by the image capturing device . The TV includes a display unit and a RF ID reader writer .

The server is a computer that holds image data uploaded from the image capturing device and that downloads the image data to the TV . The server has a storage device in which data is stored.

When images of objects such as scenery are captured the images are converted to captured data image data by the video processing unit data. Then in communicable conditions the image data is transmitted to an access point using the first antenna for a wireless Local Area Network LAN or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX and eventually recorded as the data via the Internet to the predetermined server .

Here the first processing unit records the captured image state information regarding the captured image data onto the second memory in a RF ID unit . The captured image state information indicates at least one of a date of time of capturing each of the images b the number of the captured images c date and time of finally transmitting uploading an image d the number of transmitted uploaded images and e date and time of finally capturing an image. In addition the captured image state information includes f serial numbers of images that have already been uploaded or images that have not yet been uploaded g a serial number of a finally captured image and the like.

In addition the first processing unit generates a Uniform Resource Locator URL of the data that is uploaded to the server . The first processing unit records the server specific information onto the second memory . The server specific information is used to access the image data. The medium identification information is also recorded on the second memory . The medium identification information is used to determine whether the device embedded with the RF ID RF ID unit is a camera a card or a post card.

When a main power of the camera the first power supply unit such as a battery is ON the second memory receives power from the main power. Even if the main power of the camera is OFF the external RF ID reader writer is located outside supplies power to the RF ID antenna . This enables the passive second power supply unit without any power like a battery to adjust a voltage to provide power to respective units in a RF ID circuit unit including the second memory. Thereby it is possible to supply power to the second memory so that the data is exchanged between the second memory and the external device to be recorded and reproduced. Here the second power supply unit is a circuit generating power from radio waves received by the second antenna RF ID antenna . The second power supply unit includes a rectifier circuit and the like. Whenever the main power is ON or OFF the data in the second memory is read and written by the second processing unit . When the main power is ON the data in the second memory can be read and written also by the first processing unit . In other words the second memory is implemented as a nonvolatile memory and both the first processing unit and the second processing unit can read and write data from and to the second memory .

When the image capturing device completes capturing images of a trip or the like and then the captured images are to be reproduced the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV as illustrated on the right side of as being the situation of reproducing images. Then the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the RF ID unit via the second antenna and thereby the second power supply unit provides power to the units in the RF ID unit even if the main power the first power supply unit of the image capturing device is OFF. The captured image state information and the server specific information are read by the second processing unit from the second memory and transmitted to the TV via the second antenna . The TV generates a URL based on the server specific information then downloads the image data of the data from the server and eventually displays on the display unit thumbnails or the like of images in the image data. If it is determined based on the captured image state information that there is any captured image not yet been uploaded to the server the determination result is displayed on the display unit . If necessary the image capturing device is activated to upload to the server image data of the captured image not yet been uploaded.

As illustrated in the first antenna used for a wireless LAN and the second antenna used for the RF ID unit are embedded in a right side of the image capturing device . The antennas are covered with an antenna cover made of a material not shielding radio waves. The RF ID unit operates at a frequency of 13.5 MHz while the wireless LAN operates at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The significant difference in frequency prevents interference between them. Therefore the two antennas and are seen overlapping with each other from the outside as illustrated in . The structure decreases an installation area of the antennas eventually reducing a size of the image capturing device . The structure also enables the single antenna cover to cover both of the two antennas as illustrated in so that the part made of the material not shielding radio waves is minimized. The material not shielding radio waves such as plastic has a strength lower than that of a metal. Therefore the minimization of the material can reduce a decrease in a strength of a body of the image capturing device . The image capturing device further includes a lens and a power switch . The units assigned with numeral references to will be described later.

Image data captured by an image capturing unit is provided to a recording reproducing unit via the video processing unit and then recorded onto a third memory . The image data is eventually recorded onto an Integrated Circuit IC card that is removable from the image capturing device .

The above processing is instructed by the first processing unit that is for example a Central Processing Unit CPU . The image data such as captured photographs or video is provided to an encryption unit a transmission unit in a communication unit and then the first antenna in order to be transmitted to an access point or the like by radio via a wireless LAN WiMAX or the like. From the access point or the like the image data is transmitted to the server via the Internet . In the above manner the image data such as photographs is uploaded.

There is a situation where a part of the image data fails to be uploaded because for example the communication state is not good or there is no nearby access point or base station. In the situation some images have already been uploaded to the server and the other images have not yet been uploaded. Therefore the image data in the server is different from the image data captured by the image capturing device . In the first embodiment of the present invention the RF ID reader writer of the TV or the like reads the server specific information and the like from the second memory in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device . Then based on the readout information a URL or the like of the server is generated. According to the URL the TV accesses the server to access the data such as a file folder or the like uploaded by the image capturing device . Then the TV downloads the uploaded images from among the images captured by the image capturing device and displays the downloaded images. The above method will be described in more detail later.

If a part or all of the captured images is not uploaded as image data of the data in the server a problem would occur that a user downloading the images to the TV cannot watch a part of the images on the TV .

In order to solve the problem in the first embodiment of the present invention the first processing unit causes a recording reproducing unit to indicate information regarding a state of captured images such as information of uploading state to the captured image state information in the second memory .

The above is described in more detail with reference to . In the second memory synchronization information is recorded. The synchronization information indicates whether or not image data in the server matches image data captured by the camera in other words whether or not the image data in the server is in synchronization with the image data captured by the camera. In the first embodiment of the present invention the TV reads the captured image state information from the second memory via the second antenna . The captured image state information makes it possible to instantly determine whether or not the data in the server lacks any image. If the determination is made that there is any image that has not yet been uploaded then the determination result is displayed on the display unit of the TV . Here the TV also displays a message of Please upload images to a viewer. Or the TV issues an instruction to the camera via the RF ID antenna to transmit an activation signal to the activation unit thereby supplying power to the first power supply unit of the image capturing device . Thereby the TV causes the image capturing device to upload to the server the images in the first memory or the like of the image capturing device which have not yet been uploaded via a wireless LAN a wired LAN the second antenna RF ID antenna or the like.

Since transmission via the RF ID antenna has a small transfer amount transmission of the image data as originally captured takes a considerable time to upload and display the image data. This causes a user to feel unpleasant. In order to avoid this according to the first embodiment of the present invention when the image data is transmitted via the RF ID antenna thumbnails of the images not yet been uploaded are transmitted instead. The thumbnails can shorten apparent upload time and display time suppressing unpleasant feeling of the user. Most of current RF ID having a high communication ability has a transfer amount of several hundreds kbps. However development of RF ID having a quad speed has been examined. The quad speed RF ID has a possibility of achieving a transfer amount of several Mbps. If thumbnails of images not yet been uploaded are transmitted it is possible to transmit several dozens of thumbnails in one second. If thumbnails are displayed in a list thumbnails of all images including images not yet been uploaded can be displayed on the TV within a time period a general user can tolerate. The above is one of practical solutions.

If the image capturing device is forced to be activated to upload images not yet been uploaded as described above the most speedy and stable path is selected from a wireless LAN the RF ID antenna and a wired LAN to be used for uploading and displaying on the TV. In the situation where the image capturing device receives power from the outside via the second antenna the communication unit transmitting signals to the second antenna performs communication with the outside by a low speed modulation method. On the other hand in the situation where the image capturing device can receive power from the first power supply unit or the like the communication unit switches the modulation method to a modulation method having a large signal point such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM or 64 QAM as needed in order to achieve high speed transfer to upload the image data not yet been uploaded in a short time. Furthermore when the power detection unit detects for example that the first power supply unit or the like does not have enough power or that the image capturing device is not connected to an external power the first power supply unit stops supplying power and a modulation switch unit switches the modulation method employed by the communication unit to a modulation method having a smaller signal point or less transfer rate. As a result it is possible to prevent that the capacity of the first power supply unit is reduced to be equal to or less than a set value.

There is another solution for power. When power is not enough the second processing unit the communication unit or the like sends a power increase request signal to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna to request for power support. In response to the request the RF ID reader writer increases providing power to have a value greater than the set value for the power used in reading data from the RF ID unit. Since the RF ID unit receives more power via the second antenna the RF ID unit can provide power to the communication unit or the first processing unit . Thereby a power amount of a battery for the first power supply unit is not reduced. Or without the battery the image capturing device can practically and unlimitedly continue transmission.

As still another method uploaded image data information in can be used. In uploaded image data information uploaded image information such as serial numbers of photographs is recorded. It is also possible to use hashed information generated by hashing the information . As a result a data amount is reduced.

The TV can read the above information to be compared to information of images captured by the camera thereby obtaining information of images not yet been uploaded.

As still another method not yet uploaded image data existence identification information can be used. The not yet uploaded image data existence identification information includes an existence identifier indicating whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. Since existence of images not yet been uploaded is notified data in the second memory can be significantly reduced.

It is also possible to use not yet uploaded image number indicating the number of images not yet been uploaded. Since the image capturing device allows the TV to read the information a viewer can be informed of the number of images to be uploaded. In this case a data capacity in addition to the number is recorded as the captured image state information . Thereby the image capturing device enables the TV to display a more exact prediction time required to upload images not yet been uploaded.

It is also possible to use not yet uploaded image information hashed information that is generated by hashing information regarding images not yet been uploaded.

In addition it is also possible to record a final capturing time final capturing date time in the second memory . Later the TV reads the final capturing time . The TV is connected to the server to compare the final capturing time to a capturing date of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby it is possible to easily determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If images are captured and assigned with serial numbers sequentially from an older image it is possible to record only a final image serial number . The final image serial number is compared to a serial number of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. It is also possible to record onto the second memory captured image information that is for example serial numbers of all captured images. Thereby the TV later accesses the server to match the serial numbers to images uploaded to the server . As a result it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. When the captured image information is used use of hashed information generated by hashing the captured image information can compress the captured image information .

The second memory further stores Unique IDentification UID of the RF ID unit camera ID and the medium identification information . Even if the main power of the camera except a sub power for backup etc. of a clock is OFF these pieces of information can be read by the TV via the second antenna to be used for identifying the camera or the user or authenticating a device apparatus . When the user comes back from an overseas trip or the like the camera is likely to have a small charge amount of the battery. However according to the first embodiment of the present invention the camera can be operated to transmit information without battery which is highly convenient for the user. The medium identification information includes an identifier or the like indicating whether the medium or device embedded with the RF ID unit is a camera a camcorder a post card a card or a mobile phone. The identifier enables the TV to identify the medium or device. Thereby the TV can display a mark or icon of the camera or postcard on a screen as illustrated in as will be described. The TV can also change processing depending on the identifier.

The second memory also stores image display method instruction information . For example in the situation where a list display in is selected when the second antenna is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV the image capturing device camera causes the TV to display a list of thumbnails of images such as photographs.

In the situation where slide show is selected the image capturing device causes the TV to sequentially display images from a newer one or an older one.

In a lower part of the second memory in there is a region for recording the server specific information .

The server specific information allows a camera operator to display images on the TV screen by a preferred method.

The server specific information includes server URL generation information that is source information from which a server URL is generated. An example of the server URL generation information is login ID . The server specific information has a region in which server address information and user identification information are recorded. In practical login ID and the like are recorded. In addition there is a region for storing a password . An encrypted password may be stored in the region. The above pieces of information are used to generate an URL by a URL generation unit that is provided in the image capturing device the RF ID unit the camera function used for capturing images in the image capturing device or the TV . The URL is used for accessing a group of images corresponding to the image capturing device or the user in the server . If the URL generation unit is provided in the RF ID unit the URL generation unit receives power from the second power supply unit

It is also possible to generate URL without using the above pieces of information and store the generated URL directly to the second memory .

It is characterized in that the above described pieces of information stored in the second memory can be read by both the second processing unit in the RF ID unit and the first processing unit in the camera function.

The above structure allows the TV reading the RF ID unit in the camera to instantly obtain the pieces of information regarding uploading state the sever address information the login ID the password and the like. Thereby the TV can download image data corresponding to the camera from the server and display the image data at a high speed.

In the above situation even if the main power of the image capturing device is OFF the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the second power supply unit to activate operate the image capturing device . Therefore power of the battery in the image capturing device is not reduced.

Referring back to the first power supply unit receives power from the battery to provide power to the units in the camera. In a quiescent state however a third power supply unit provides weak power to the clock and the like. In some cases the third power supply unit supplies backup power to a part of the second memory .

The RF ID unit receives power from the second antenna to provide power to the second power supply unit thereby operating the second processing unit or operating a data receiving unit a recording unit a reproducing unit a data transfer unit the communication unit and the second memory .

Therefore in a quiescent state of the camera no power is consumed. As a result it is possible to keep the battery of the camera longer.

The processing performed by the image capturing device referred to also as a medium such as a camera or card and the processing performed by the TV and the RF ID reader writer are explained with reference to a flowchart of .

If the main power is OFF at Step in it is determined at Step whether or not activation setting of the RF ID reader writer for the main power OFF is made. If the activation setting is made then the RF ID reader writer is turned ON at Step and changed to be in a power saving mode at Step

At Step impedance or the like of an antenna unit is measured or a nearby sensor is measured. When the RF ID unit is moved into proximity of an antenna of the RF ID reader writer at Step it is detected at Step whether or not the RF ID unit is in proximity of or contacts the antenna. If it is detected that the RF ID unit is in proximity of or contacts the antenna then the RF ID reader writer starts supplying power to the antenna of the medium at Step .

If the images are to be displayed in a list then the TV reads a display order identifier at Step . At Step the TV displays the images in a list in a date order or an upload order based on the display order identifier. At Step the TV reads a slide show identifier from the medium. At Step the TV determines whether or not the slide show identifier indicates that images are to be displayed as slide show. If the images are to be displayed as a slide show then at Step the TV displays the images as slide show based on the display order identifier . Then the TV reads image quality prioritization from the second memory of the medium. At Step of the TV determines whether or not the image quality prioritization indicates that the images are to be displayed by prioritizing image quality. If the images are not to be displayed by prioritizing image quality the TV reads speed prioritization from the medium at Step and further determines at Step whether or not the speed prioritization indicates that the images are to be displayed by prioritizing a speed. If a speed is to be prioritized then the TV determines at Step whether or not the server stores display audio. At Step the TV reads and checks display audio server directory from the medium. At Step the TV accesses the directory in the server to obtain the display audio and outputs the audio.

At Step the TV determines whether or not all images are to be displayed as priorities. If all images are not to be displayed as priorities then at Step the TV selects a part of the images. At Steps the TV reads specific directory information from the medium at Step and receives images in the specific directory from the server at Step . At Step the TV displays the images in the specific directory. On the other hand if it is determined at Step that all images are to be displayed as priorities then the TV may display all images at Step . At Step the TV determines whether or not the image display is completed. If the image display is completed then the TV displays a message view other image s at Step . If the user agrees then the TV displays a menu of images in different directories at Step

At Step of the TV determines whether or not images captured by a specific user are requested. If images captured by a specific user are requested then at Step the TV requests the medium to provide a specific user all image information at Step and b a specific user password that is a password of the specific user. At Step the TV determines whether or not the password is correct. If the password is correct then at Step the TV reads directory information of a directory of a file storing an image list from the medium. At Step the TV accesses the server to access a directory having an image list of the specific user. At Step the TV downloads image data in the directory from the server. At Step the TV displays the images captured by the specific user.

At Step the TV starts color correction routine. At Step the TV reads camera model information from the camera ID . At Steps and the TV downloads characteristic information of the camera model from the server. Then at Steps and the TV downloads characteristic information of the TV from the server. At Step the server calculates the characteristic information to generate modified information. At Step the TV modifies color and brightness of the display unit based on the pieces of characteristic information of the medium camera and the TV. At Step the TV displays the images with the modified color and brightness.

At Step of the TV determines whether or not forced print instruction is selected. Here if forced print instruction is selected it is determined at Step whether or not the terminal the TV in the above example to which the medium camera is moved closer is a printer or a terminal connected to the printer. If the terminal is a printer or a terminal connected to the printer then the terminal obtains at Step camera model information of the medium camera and a model name of the printer for each image data. At Step the terminal modifies each piece of information of the server to generate modified information. At Step the terminal receives directory information of a directory in which the image data to be printed is stored. At the terminal accesses the server by using an address of the directory having the image data to be printed or file name . At Step the server sends the image data stored in the directory to the terminal. At Step the TV receives the image data to be printed. At Step the terminal prints the image data. At Step the printing is completed. At Step for each image data the terminal records onto the server an identifier indicating that one printing process is completed. At Step the server assigns a print completion identifier to the image data that is stored in the server and has been printed.

Next the following describes the situation where the medium such as a camera or a post card does not have a memory for storing data.

Steps of follow the numbers and in circles in . At Step of a main power of the TV is turned ON. At Step the TV reads UID of the RF ID unit from the second memory. At Step the TV obtains the UID. At Step the TV reads the server specific information from the second memory. At Step the TV accesses a server directory. At Step the TV searches the server directories for a final server providing service corresponding to the UID. At Step the TV determines whether or not such a final server exists. If there is such a final server then at Step the TV accesses the final server and reads a user ID a password and a service name from a UID list at Step . At Step the TV determines whether or not a password is requested. If the password is requested then the TV determines at Step whether or not the readout password is correct. At Step of the TV determines whether or not the service is regarding photographs or video. If the service is regarding photographs or video then at Step the TV reads i reads from a specific directory in the server associated with the UID a a corresponding program such as a billing program b a list including an address or a file name of image data to be displayed c image display instruction information d forced display instruction e forced print instruction and f camera ID and ii automatically displays the image data or causes the image data to be printed based on the above pieces of information and procedure.

If needed password entry is requested at Step . At Step the TV determines whether or not the user desires to print a specific image. If the user desires to print a specific image then at Step the TV adds data of the specific image to the server associated with the UID or to a print directory of the TV. At Step the TV determines whether or not the TV is connected to a printer and there is an independent printer. If so then at Step the RF ID unit of the medium such as a post card is moved into proximity of a RF ID reader writer of the printer. At Step of the printer i reads UID of the RF ID from the medium ii thereby reads image data to be printed or a location of the image data from the print directory on the server having the modified information and iii prints the image data. At Step the printing is completed. Thereby the above processing is completed.

Step of is the number in . At Step the TV determines whether or not the service is for shopping. If the service is for shopping then the TV determines at Step whether or not authentication is successful. If the authentication is successful then at Step the TV reads from the server a shopping billing program associated with the UID and executes the program. At Step the execution of the program is completed. Thereby the above processing is completed.

Next the following describes a method of reading information from a RF ID unit embedded in a postcard without a RF ID reader.

At Step of a second RF ID unit on which URLs of relay servers are recorded is attached to or embedded in the medium such as a post card. On the outer surface of the second RF ID unit a UID of the second RF ID unit and b information for identifying a first URL of a certain relay server are printed to be displayed by a two dimensional bar code.

At Step there is a camera capable of being connected to a main server. The camera has a first RF ID unit on which a first URL of the main server is recorded. An image capturing unit in the camera optically reads the two dimensional bar code and converts the readout information to information for identifying a the UID of a second RF ID unit in the post card and b a second URL of a relay server.

At Step the camera selects a specific set of images from images captured by the camera and stores the set of images into a specific first directory in the main server. At the same time the camera uploads information of first directory first directory information as well as the first URL of the main server a specific second directory in the relay server having the second URL. The camera uploads information for associating the UID of the second RF ID unit with the second directory to the relay server having the second URL. At Step the medium such as a post card is mailed to a specific person.

At Step of the person receiving the post card moves the RF ID unit of the post card into proximity of a RF ID reader of a TV or the like. Thereby the TV reads from the RF ID unit the second URL of the relay server and the UID of the post card.

At Step the TV accesses the relay server having the second URL. Then the TV reads from the relay server a a program in the second directory associated with the UID and or b the first URL and the first directory information of the main server on which specific image data is recorded. The TV downloads the image data from the main server. The TV displays the image data on a screen. In the above case the image capturing unit in the image capturing device according to the first embodiment of the present invention reads information from the two dimensional bar code that is generally printed in a product or post card to record server information. Then the image capturing device records the information read from the two dimensional bar code as digital information onto the second memory of the RF ID unit. Thereby the image capturing device allows a RF ID reader of a TV to read the information. As a result even a TV without an optical sensor for two dimensional bar codes can indirectly read information of two dimensional bar codes and automatically access a server or the like.

When the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the antenna the TV displays a camera icon for notifying of that the medium is a camera in the manner described previously.

Next since the number for example five of images not yet been uploaded is detected the TV displays five blank images and as if these images were taken out from the camera icon .

Thereby the TV displays tangible information of images by changing materials to information . As a result the user can perceive the information of images by more natural sense.

Regarding images that have been already uploaded to the server actual images and are displayed as tangible data in the same manner as described above.

Next the following processing is described in detail. By the processing an operation program illustrated in is transmitted to the TV illustrated in that is an apparatus device communicating with the RF ID unit of the image capturing device . The communicating device TV executes the transmitted program.

The RF ID unit in the image capturing device has the second memory . The second memory holds the operation program . The operation program can be executed by the TV communicating with the RF ID unit. In more detail the operation program is an example of the program executed by the TV with reference to the identification information of the image capturing device . The operation program is for example an execution program such as Java program a virtual machine script program such as Javascript program or the like.

The reproducing unit in the RF ID unit reads necessary information and the operation program from the second memory . The necessary information is required to execute the operation program . The necessary information includes the UID unique to the image capturing device the server specific information including the URL of the server and the like. The necessary information and the operation program are transmitted to the RF ID reader writer in the remote controller via the data transfer unit and the second antenna . The remote controller remotely controls the TV .

The RF ID reader writer of the remote controller receives the necessary information and the operation program from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and stores them into a RF ID storage unit .

A remote controller signal generation unit in the remote controller converts the necessary information and the operation program which are transmitted from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and stored in the RF ID storage unit to remote controller signals. The remote controller signals such as infrared signals are widely used in communication for present remote controllers.

To the TV a remote controller signal transmission unit transmits the remote controller signals including the operation program which are generated by the remote controller signal generation unit .

A remote controller signal receiving unit in the TV receives the remote controller signals from the remote controller . A program execution unit such as a Java virtual machine retrieves the necessary information and the operation program in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device from the remote controller signals by using a decryption unit . Thereby the program execution unit executes the operation program.

When the remote controller is moved into proximity of the image capturing device the RF ID reader writer of the remote controller provides power to the RF ID unit in the image capturing device via RF ID communication. Thereby the UID unique to the image capturing device the URL of the image server image server URL and the operation program are read from the second memory S . The readout UID image server URL and operation program are transmitted to the remote controller via the data transfer unit and the second antenna S . Here as presented in the operation program includes server connection instruction download instruction slide show display instruction download completion time processing set instruction and download completion time instruction .

The remote controller receives the UID the image server URL and the operation program from the image capturing device via the RF ID reader writer S . A determination is made as to whether or not receiving is completed S . If receiving is completed then the UID the image server URL and the operation program are stored in the RF ID storage unit S . Then the UID the image server URL and the operation program are converted to remote controller signals transmittable by infrared ray S . A determination is made as to whether or not the user performs a predetermined input operation by the remote controller to instruct to transmit the remote controller signals to the TV S . If the instruction is received by from user then the remote controller signal transmission unit transmits the remote controller signals including the image server URL and the operation program to the TV S . In other words serving as a common remote controller the remote controller serves also as a relay device that transfers the UID the image server URL and the operation program from the image capturing device to the TV by using the embedded RF ID reader writer .

Next the TV receives the remote controller signals from the remote controller S . The decryption unit in the TV retrieves decrypts the UID the image server URL and the operation program from the remote controller signals S . Then the program execution unit executes the operation program with reference to the image server URL S to S . More specifically by the operation program connection between the TV and the image server on a communication network is established with reference to the image server URL S and in . Then with reference to the UID unique to a corresponding image capturing unit image data captured by a specific image capturing unit is selected from the image data stored in the storage device of the image server and the selected image data is downloaded to the TV S and in . In other words the UID is used to select image data associated with the image capturing device indicated by the UID from among pieces of image data stored in the image server . A determination is made as to whether or not the image download is completed S . If the image download is completed the downloaded images are sequentially displayed as a slide show S and and in . The download completion time processing set instruction in is instruction for setting processing to be performed when image downloading is completed. In the example of the download completion time processing set instruction instructs the download completion time instruction as the processing to be performed when image downloading is completed. Moreover the download completion time instruction calls the slide show display instruction for performing a slide show of the images.

It should be noted that referring to it has been described that the operation program and the necessary information for the operation program are transferred from the image capturing device to the TV via the remote controller . However the RF ID reader writer of the remote controller may be provided to the TV . In other words the RF ID reader writer may be embedded in the TV . Furthermore the communication path connecting the reader RF ID reader writer to the apparatus may be a wireless communication path such as infrared communication path or a wired signal cable.

It should also be noted that in the above described execution example the UID is used to select image data associated with the image capturing device from among pieces of image data stored in the image server . However it is also possible to use the UID to identify the image server storing the image data. Here it is assumed that in a communication system including a plurality of image servers UID is associated with an image server storing image data captured by an image capturing device identified by the UID. Under the assumption if the operation program is created so that a URL of the image server can be identified with reference to the UID the TV executing the operation program can identify by using the UID the image server associated with the UID from the plurality of image servers and thereby download the image data from the identified image server.

It should also be noted that the identification information for identifying the image capturing device is not limited to UID. The identification information may be any other information regarding the image capturing device such as a serial number a product serial number a Media Access Control MAC address or information equivalent to the MAC address for example an Internet Protocol IP address. Moreover if the image capturing device serves as an access point on a wireless LAN the identification information may be a Service Set Identifier SSID or any information equivalent to SSID. It should also be noted that in the above described second memory the identification information UID unit for identifying the image capturing device has been described to be stored separately from the operation program . However the identification information may be stored described in the operation program .

It should also be noted that the remote controller signals in other words the communication path connecting the reader to the apparatus are described to employ infrared ray. However the remote controller signals are limited to the above but may employ a wireless communication method such as Bluetooth. The use of wireless communication that is generally speedier than infrared communication can shorten a time required to transfer an operation program and or the like.

It should be noted that the operation program is not limited to the program in the format presented in . The operation program may be described in any other programming language. For example the operation program described in Java can be easily executed by various apparatuses devices because the program execution circumstances called JavaVM have broad versatility. The operation program may be described in a compact programming language in a script format represented by Javascript so as to be stored in a small storage capacity. The operation program in such a compact programming language can be stored in the RF ID unit in the second memory even if the RF ID unit has a small storage capacity. Moreover the operation program may be in an executable format applied with processing such as compiling rather than a source code presented in . The program can reduce a processing load on apparatuses having program execution environments.

The following describes in detail the processing of changing execution of a program depending on information unique to a display device such as the TV having a RF ID reader with reference to FIGS. and .

The TV illustrated in further includes a language code holding unit . When the operation program received as remote controller signals is executed to connect the TV to the server the program execution unit reads a language code from the language code holding unit to connect the TV to the server compliant to the language code. Then the operation program is executed to download a server program from the server and executes the downloaded server program. For example if the language code indicates Japanese language the TV is connected to the server having a program storage unit in which a server program compliant to Japanese language is stored and then the server program is obtained from the program storage unit to be executed in the TV . More specifically the operation program stored in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device as illustrated in executes only connection to the server while other processing such as image display is executed by the server program downloaded from the server .

The steps in the above processing are described with reference to . The processing by which the TV receives the operation program and the necessary information for the operation program from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device is the same as the processing described previously with reference to . In it is assumed that the server specific information which the TV receives as remote controller signals includes two different server addresses which are a a sever address of a server compliant to English and a a server address of a different server compliant to Japanese. It is also assumed that the operation program which the TV receives as remote controller signals includes instruction for connecting the TV to a server indicated by the server connection instruction in .

In the execution environments the TV obtains a language code of the TV S . The TV determines whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language S . If the language code indicates Japanese language then the TV selects from the server specific information a sever address of a server having a program storage unit storing an operation program for processing compliant to Japanese S . On the other hand if the language code does not indicate Japanese language then the TV selects from the server specific information a server address of a server having a program storage unit storing an operation program for processing compliant to English S . Next the TV is connected to the server with reference to the selected server address S . The TV downloads a server program from the server S S . The TV executes the downloaded server program in the program execution environments for example a virtual machine of the TV S .

It should be noted that the use of the language code has been described in but the language code may be replaced by other information. Examples are a product serial number a serial number of the display device TV and the like each of which indicates a country where the display device is on the market or equipped.

The first embodiment of the present invention can solve the above problem. In the first embodiment of the present invention RF ID is used to perform authentication. In more detail an authentication program including a MAC address is recorded as an operation program in the second memory in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device . When the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV the image capturing device provides the authentication program to the TV . The authentication program includes not only the MAC address but also a cryptography key for authentication hereinafter authentication cryptography key and an authentication command. When the TV recognizes that the information provided from the RF ID unit includes the authentication command the TV performs authentication processing. The communication unit in the RF ID unit cannot communicate with the TV until the image capturing device is physically located in proximity of the RF ID reader writer . Therefore it is extremely difficult to intercept the communication between the image capturing device and the TV which is performed in a house. In addition since the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the TV to exchange data it is possible to prevent that the image capturing device authenticates a wrong device apparatus such as the TV in a neighbor or a DVD recorder in the user s house.

The following is an example of an authentication method without using RF ID with reference to . A user inputs to the TV a MAC addresses of terminals to be authenticated such as the camera the image capturing device and the DVD recorder which the user intends to authenticate for communication and b authentication cryptography keys for the terminals. The TV receiving the inputs transmits an appropriate message called a challenge to a target terminal having the MAC address. When the image capturing device receives the challenge the image capturing device encrypts the challenge using the authentication cryptography key and returns the encrypted challenge to the TV that is a terminal from which the challenge has been provided. In receiving the encrypted challenge the TV decrypts the encrypted challenge using the authentication cryptography key . Thereby the TV can authenticate the authentication cryptography key to prevent user s error and intervention of other malicious users. Next the TV encrypts a cryptography key for data hereinafter a data cryptography key using the authentication cryptography key . Then the TV transmits the encrypted data cryptography key to the image capturing device . Thereby it is possible to perform the encrypted data communication between the TV and the image capturing device . The TV performs the above described processing also with the DVD recorder and other apparatuses terminals and in order to share the data cryptography key among them. Thereby the TV can perform encrypted communication with all terminals devices apparatuses or the like connected in the home network.

On the other hand illustrates an authentication method using RF ID. In the authentication method using RF ID the image capturing device camera generates an authentication program . The camera provides the generated authentication program from the RF ID unit in the camera to a RF ID unit in the TV . The authentication program includes an authentication command a MAC address of the camera and an authentication cryptography key for the camera. When the TV receives the authentication program with the authentication command the TV retrieves the MAC address and the authentication cryptography key from the RF ID unit . The TV encrypts a data cryptography key using the retrieved authentication cryptography key and transmits the encrypted data cryptography key to the retrieved MAC address. The transmission is performed by a wireless LAN device terminal . In the authentication method using RF ID the authentication is performed automatically without any user s input. Therefore there is no problem caused by user s input errors. In addition since the image capturing device camera needs to moved into proximity of the TV it is possible to prevent intervention of other malicious users. This authentication method using RF ID can eliminate pre processing such as the above described challenge. Moreover the action of physically moving the image capturing device camera into proximity of the TV enables the user to easily recognize which terminals the camera has authenticated. Furthermore if the authentication cryptography key is not included in the authentication program the authentication may be performed by a technique of general public key authentication. In addition the communication device medium is not limited to a wireless LAN but may be any medium such as PLC or Ethernet included in the home network. Moreover the MAC address may be any identification information for uniquely identifying a communication terminal in the home network.

Next the following situation is described in detail with reference to figures. Here the image capturing device described with reference to generates or updates a program executable by the TV . Then the image capturing device transmits the program to the TV via the data transmission unit . Thereby the TV executes the program.

The second memory reading unit reads information from the second memory via the recording reproducing unit .

The URL generation unit reads the UID the server specific information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information from the second memory via the second memory reading unit . From the above pieces of information the URL generation unit generates a URL that is an address of the server to which images have been uploaded from the image capturing device .

The UID is identification information for identifying the image capturing device . The UID is unique to each image capturing device . The URL generated by the URL generation unit includes UID. For instance the image server to which images are uploaded has an image file in a directory unique to each UID. Thereby a URL address can be generated for each image capturing device .

The server specific information is a server name for identifying the server to which the images are uploaded. Via a Domain Name Server DNS an IP address of the server is determined to connect the image capturing device to the server . Therefore the server specific information is included in the generated URL.

The image display method instruction information is information for enabling the user to optionally select the list display the slide show display or the like. The URL generation unit generates the URL based on the image display method instruction information . In other words since the generated URL includes information indicating the list display or the slide show display the image server the server can determine based on the URL whether the images are to be displayed as the list display or the slide show display.

As described above based on the UID the server specific information the captured image state information the image display method instruction information and the like which are stored in the second memory the URL generation unit generates a URL of the image server in which images to be watched are stored. Then the URL generation unit provides the generated URL to the program generation unit .

The program generation unit generates a program executable by the TV based on a the URI generated by the URL generation unit and b forced display instruction forced print instruction and format identification information stored in the second memory . It should be noted that the program generation unit can generate a new operation program based on the above described information which is a method of generating a new operation program. The program generation unit can also generate such a new operation program by updating an operation program that has been already generated.

The program generated by the program generation unit is executable by the TV . The program should be compiled into a machine language used in a system controller not shown of the TV so that the system controller can execute the program. In this case the program generation unit has a compiler to convert the generated program to a program in an executable format.

However the above described compiler is not necessary if the program in a text format script for example a general Java script is executed by a browser in the TV .

The URL provided to the program generation unit is used to connect the TV to the image server server in which images are stored. By using the URL the program generation unit generates or updates a connection program hereinafter referred to also as a server connection program or connection program for connecting the TV to the image server.

The forced display instruction is optional and used in the following situation. For example there is the situation where while the user watches on the TV a TV program provided by general broadcast waves the RF ID reader writer of the TV becomes communicable with the image capturing device via the second antenna . In the situation the forced display instruction is used to automatically set the TV into a browser watching mode so that image data provided from the image server is displayed on the TV . If this option is selected the program generation unit generates a program for forcing the TV to display image data.

The forced print instruction is optional and used in the following situation. For example there is the situation where while the user watches on the TV a TV program provided by general broadcast waves the RF ID reader writer of the TV becomes communicable with the image capturing device via the second antenna . In the situation the forced print instruction is used to automatically print image data stored in the image server by a printer not shown connected to the TV . If this option is selected the program generation unit generates a program for forcing the TV to print image data by the printer.

The format identification information is information of a format by which image data is to be displayed. When an option of language code optimization selection in the format identification information is selected the program generation unit generates a program for selecting a URL to be connected based on the language code set in the TV . The following is an example in the situation where the option of language code optimization selection in the format identification information is selected. If the language code of the TV indicates Japanese language the program generation unit selects a Japanese site as the URL to be connected. On the other hand if the language code of the TV does not indicate Japanese language the program generation unit selects an English site as the URL to be connected. Or the URL generation unit may generate two URLs for the Japanese site and the English site and provide the two URLs to the program generation unit .

The program part storage unit holds program command information used by the program generation unit to generate a program. A program part stored in the program part storage unit may be a general library or an Application Programming Interface API . In order to generate a connection command for connecting the TV to the server the program generation unit combines a server connection command Connect in the program part storage unit with the URL generated by the URL generation unit . Thereby the program generation unit generates or updates a connection program for connecting the TV to the server indicated by the URL.

The program writing unit is an interface used to write the program generated by the program generation unit to the second memory .

The program provided from the program writing unit is stored into a program storage unit in the second memory via the recording reproducing unit .

When the image capturing device is moved to bring the RF ID unit of the image capturing device into proximity of the RF ID reader writer connected to the TV the reproducing unit reads out the program from the program storage unit in the second memory . Then transmission signals indicating the program are transmitted to the RF ID reader writer via the data transfer unit and the second antenna . The TV receives the transmission signals via the RF ID reader writer . The TV executes the receives program.

The product serial number is a product serial number of the TV . From the product serial number it is possible to learn a manufacture date time a manufacture location a manufacturing line and a manufacturer of the TV .

The language code is predetermined in the TV to be used in displaying a menu for example. The language code is not limited to be predetermined but can be switched to another by the user.

The program execution virtual machine is a virtual machine that executes a received program. The program execution virtual machine may be implemented as hardware or software. For example the program execution virtual machine may be a Java virtual machine. The Java virtual machine is a stack or interpreter virtual machine that executes defined instruction sets. If the image capturing device has the virtual machine the program generated by the program generation unit in the image capturing device is compliant to any execution platforms. As a result the program generation unit can generate a program executable in any platforms.

Next based on the server specific information stored in the second memory the program generation unit generates a connection command for connecting the TV to the server by using the URL generated by the URL generation unit S . In order to generate the connection command the program generation unit selects an instruction set for example Connect in for a server connection command from the program part storage unit and combines the selected instruction set with the URL. Thereby a server connection program for example Connect URL is generated.

Then the program generation unit examines the forced display instruction in the second memory so as to determine whether or not the forced display instruction is selected S . If the forced display instruction is selected then the program generation unit calls an instruction set for a forced display program from the program part storage unit and thereby generates a forced display command S . The generated forced display command is added to the program S .

On the other hand if the forced display instruction is not selected then the program generation unit does not generate the forced display command but proceeds to S.

Next the program generation unit makes a determination as to whether the forced print instruction in the second memory is selected S . If the forced print instruction is selected then the program generation unit generates a forced print command for forcing the TV to print by a printer an image file stored in the server S . The generated print command is added to the program S .

Then the program generation unit examines the image display method instruction information in the second memory so as to determine whether or not the list display is selected S . If the list display is selected then the program generation unit generates a list display command for causing the TV to display a list of the image file stored in the server S . The generated list display command is added to the program S .

After that the program generation unit examines the image display method instruction information in the second memory so as to determine whether or not the slide show is selected S . If the slide show is selected then the program generation unit generates a slide show command for causing the TV to display a slide show of the image file stored in the server S . The generated slide show command is added to the program S .

As described above based on the information set in the second memory the program generation unit in the image capturing device generates a program used to display images on the TV by using an instruction command set that is stored in the program part storage unit to generate the program.

It should be noted that in the first embodiment there are commands for the forced display instruction the forced print instruction the list display and the slide show display. However the commands programs are not limited to the above. For example if a command for the forced display instruction is to be generated as a program the program generation unit can also generate a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus device executing the program has a display device or display function and adds the generated determination command to the program. Thereby the command for the forced display instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has a display device or display function. As a result the determination command can prevent confusion in the apparatus executing the program. The same goes for a command for the forced print instruction. It is preferable that the program generation unit also generates a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function and adds the generated determination command to the program. Thereby the command for the forced print instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function.

The following describes execution of the program generated or updated by the program generation unit in the image capturing device .

First the program is executed to read the language code set in the TV as unique information of the TV S . The language code is predetermined by the user to be used in displaying a menu and the like on the TV .

Next the program is executed to determine a language indicated in the language code. First a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language S . If the determination is made that the language code indicates Japanese language then a connection command for a Japanese site is selected from the connection commands in the program S . On the other hand if the determination is made that the language code does not indicate Japanese language then a connection command for an English site is selected from the connection commands in the program S . It should be noted that it has been described in the first embodiment that a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language and thereby a connection command is selected from the connection command for connecting to a Japanese site and the connection command for connecting to an English command. However it is also possible that the program includes a plurality of connection programs compliant to various language codes. Thereby the program can be compliant to two or more language codes. As a result usability is improved. Next according to the selected connection command the program is executed to connect the TV to the URL indicted in the connection command S .

Then a determination is made as to whether or not the connection to the URL indicted in the connection command is successful S . If the connection is failed then the display unit of the TV displays warning indicating the connection failure S . On the other hand if the connection is successful then a command for displaying a slide show of an image file stored in the server is executed to display the slide show S .

It should be noted that the above is the situation where the operation program is for displaying images as a slide show. However the operation program is not limited to the above. The program may be used for performing list display forced display or forced printing. If the operation program is for forced display a step command of automatically changing setting of the TV to setting of displaying an image file stored in the server is added to the program. Thereby the user does not need to change the setting of the TV by manual in order to display images provided from the image server. In the case of the forced printing a command for automatically changing setting of the TV to a printable mode is added to the program. Moreover in the case of each of the forced printing and forced display a determination command for determining whether or not the TV has a printing function or a displaying function is added to the program. Thereby the forced print command is not executed in an apparatus device without a printing function. Furthermore the operation program in the first embodiment of the present invention may be a connection program for leading other programs. For example the operation program may be a loader program such as a boot loader for loading other programs to be executed.

As described above the first embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that the program generation unit is included in the first processing unit of the image capturing device that is a device having RF ID communication means such as the data transfer unit and the second antenna . It is also characterized in that the program generated or updated by the program generation unit is executed by a different device apparatus except the image capturing device according to the first embodiment of the present invention that is a communication device having RF ID.

Conventionally a device having RF ID needs to transfer ID information tag information which the device has from a RF ID communication unit to another device for example the TV according to the first embodiment of the present invention . The device apparatus receiving the ID information should previously hold operation programs each unique to a corresponding device having RF ID. Therefore if new products having RF ID technology appear the receiving device needs to install an operation program corresponding to the new products and execute the program. Otherwise the receiving device is excluded as not being compliant to the new products. The installation of operation programs requires technical knowledge. Not everyone can perform the installation. Therefore if various new devices having RF ID are produced other devices such as the TV of the first embodiment of the present invention become obsolete. As a result property values of user s devices are damaged.

According to the disclosure of the first embodiment of the present invention the device having RF ID technology has the program generation unit and sends not ID information tag information but a program to another device apparatus such as the TV . The apparatus such as the TV receives and executes the program. Therefore the receiving apparatus does not need to previously have operation programs for various devices having RF ID. Even if a new device having RF ID technology appears the receiving apparatus does not need to install a new program for the device. Therefore usability is significantly improved.

Therefore the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have application programs for respective items kinds or application systems of various objects having RF ID. Thereby the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have a storage device either for holding various application programs. In addition maintenance such as version up of the programs in the terminal is not necessary.

The program generated by the program generation unit is useful if it is executable in any execution platforms such as a Java language. Therefore if the device apparatus such as the TV executing programs has a Java virtual machine programs generated by any devices apparatuses can be executed.

It should be noted that the program generation unit according to the first embodiment of the present invention may has a function of updating the program previously stored in the program storage unit of the second memory . The situation of updating a program produces the same advantages as that in the situation of generating a program. The generating or updating performed by the program generation unit may be generating or updating data used in executing a program by the TV . In general the program includes additional initialization setting data. The additional data is used to switch an execution mode or to set a flag. Therefore generating or updating of the additional data is equivalent to generating or updating of the program without deviating from the inventive concepts of the present invention. This is because for execution of a program it depends on design whether a parameter for mode switching or the like is to be hold and read as data or is to be included in the program to be executed. Therefore when the program generation unit according to the first embodiment of the present invention generates or updates a program the program generation unit can also generate data such a parameter sequence used by the program. The parameter is generated based on the forced display instruction the forced print instruction the image display method instruction information the format identification information or the like stored in the second memory .

The following describes characteristic structures and processing of the second memory and the first processing unit in the image capturing device that is a communication device having RF ID according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In the first embodiment of the present invention the image capturing device that is a communication device having RF ID has a use status detection unit in the first processing unit . The use status detection unit detects a trouble related to operation a power consumption status or the like. The image capturing device generates a program for displaying the result of the detection use status on the TV that is a device apparatus different from the image capturing device .

The second memory includes the UID the server specific information the camera ID and the program storage unit .

The UID is a serial number unique to the image capturing device and used to identify the single image capturing device .

The server specific information is information for identifying the server to which image data captured by the image capturing device is transmitted by the communication unit . The server specific information includes a sever address a storing directory a login account a login passwords and the like.

The camera ID includes a product serial number a manufacturing year month date a manufacturer a manufacturing line a manufactured location and the like of the image capturing device . The camera ID also includes camera model information for identifying a model of the image capturing device .

The first processing unit includes the second memory reading unit a use status detection unit the program generation unit the program part storage unit and the program writing unit .

The second memory reading unit reads information from the second memory via the recording reproducing unit . In the first embodiment of the present invention the second memory reading unit reads the UID the server specific information and the camera ID from the second memory and provides the pieces of information to the program generation unit . Reading of the pieces of information from the second memory is performed when a readout signal is provided from a use status detection unit that is described later.

The use status detection unit detects a use status of each unit included in the image capturing device . The use status detection unit includes sensors each detecting a trouble in operation of a corresponding unit included in the image capturing device . Results of the detection of the sensors in respective units are provided to the use status detection unit . The sensors for the respective units provide the use status detection unit with trouble information battery duration a power consumption amount and the like. For example the image capturing unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not an image capturing operation of the image capturing unit has any trouble whether or not the image capturing unit functions correctly and whether or not the image capturing unit responds to a call from the use status detection unit . The video processing unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not data processing for image data captured by the image capturing unit has any trouble whether or not the video processing unit functions correctly and whether or not the video processing unit responds to a call from the use status detection unit . The first power supply unit provides the use status detection unit with a voltage level of the battery and a total power consumption amount. The communication unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not the communication unit is successfully connected to the server or the Internet whether or not the communication unit functions correctly and whether or not the communication unit responds to a call from the use status detection unit . The display unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not display processing has any trouble whether or not the display unit correctly responds to a call from the use status detection unit and the display unit functions correctly. Based on the above pieces of status information provided regarding the respective units the internal trouble detection unit in the use status detection unit determines whether or not each of the units has any trouble in its functional operation. If there is a trouble then the use status detection unit provides the program generation unit with information for specifying the trouble. The use status detection unit has a power consumption detection unit . The power consumption detection unit generates power consumption information based on the total power consumption information provided form the power supply unit and then provides the power consumption information to the program generation unit .

The program generation unit generates a program for displaying on the TV the information for specifying a trouble or the power consumption information which is provided from the use state detection unit . For generation of a program instruction sets to be included in the program are previously stored in the program part storage unit . Therefore the program generation unit generates a a display command display in for displaying a trouble or a power consumption amount and b a program for displaying information for specifying a location of the trouble and information for specifying the trouble in detail. It should be noted that the power consumption amount may be converted to a carbon dioxide emission amount and therefore a program may be generated to display the carbon dioxide emission amount.

The program generated by the program generation unit is stored in the program storage unit in the second memory via the program writing unit .

The program stored in the program storage unit in the second memory is transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the data transfer unit and then the second antenna .

With the above described structure the program generation unit in the first processing unit generates a program for displaying on the TV trouble information or use status information detected by the use status detection unit regarding use of the image capturing device . The program is transmitted to the TV that displays the trouble information or the use status information of the image capturing device . Thereby the TV can present the trouble information or the use status information to the user without installing a plurality of programs compliant to various devices including the image capturing device .

In conventional systems each of devices such as an image capturing device a camcorder an electric toothbrush and a weight scale is provided with a simple display function such as a liquid crystal device so as to display the trouble information or the use status information on the corresponding display function. Therefore the display function has a low display capability for merely displaying the trouble information as a symbol sequence or an error code. When the trouble information is presented the user needs to read instruction manual to check what kind of trouble it is. Some users have lost instruction manual and therefore obtain more information from a website on the Internet.

In the system according to the first embodiment of the present invention however a program for displaying trouble information can be executed by the TV not by the image capturing device . The TV which displays the trouble information detected by each device such as the image capturing device has a display capability higher than that of the conventional systems. Therefore the system according to the first embodiment of the present invention can solve the above conventional problem.

The following describes in detail with reference to figures the situation where a program generated by the image capturing device described with reference to is executed by a plurality of apparatuses devices including the TV .

The TV includes the RF ID reader writer and a wireless communication device . The wireless communication device is for example a general infrared communication device currently used as many remote controllers of home appliances or a short range wireless communication device used for home appliances using radio waves such as Bluetooth and ZigBee.

The remote controller with display function includes a transmission unit a display unit an input unit a RF ID reader a memory and a program execution virtual machine . The transmission unit transmits signals to the wireless communication device of the TV . The display unit displays video. The input unit receives key inputs from a user. The RF ID reader communicates with the RF ID unit . The memory stores a program received by the RF ID reader . The program execution virtual machine is a virtual machine that executes the program received by the RF ID reader . For instance recent mobile phones are example of the remote controller with display function having an infrared communication function Bluetooth a RF ID reader a liquid crystal display a key input unit a Java virtual machine and the like. The display unit and the input unit may be a liquid crystal display and a plurality of character input buttons or may be integrated into a liquid crystal touch panel for example.

The remote controller without display function includes a transmission unit an input unit a RF ID reader and a memory . The transmission unit transmits signals to the wireless communication device of the TV . The input unit such as buttons receives key inputs from a user. The RF ID reader communicates with the RF ID unit . The memory temporarily stores data received by the RF ID reader .

The remote controller without display function is for example a general remote controller having a RF ID reader. Remote controllers are common accessory devices of TVs.

In the first embodiment of the present invention there are the following four possible situations from which the user selects a preferred one. In the first situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted directly to the TV via the RF ID reader writer of the TV and executed by the TV . In the second situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted indirectly to the TV via the remote controller without display function and executed by the TV . In the third situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted indirectly to the TV via the remote controller with display function and executed by the TV . In the fourth situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted to the remote controller with display function and executed by the remote controller with display function .

The first situation has been already described above in the first embodiment. Therefore the first situation is not described again below.

In the second situation a program generated by the image capturing device is executed by the TV via the remote controller without display function such as general TV remote controllers that does not have a graphical display device such as a liquid crystal panel.

When the user moves the image capturing device to bring the RF ID unit to the RF ID reader the RF ID reader reads the program generated by the image capturing device to store the program in the memory .

Then when the user presses the input unit the program held in the memory is transmitted from the transmission unit to the wireless communication device of the TV . The program execution virtual machine in the TV executes the program. If the wireless communication device is a directional infrared communication device the user presses the input unit facing the remote controller without display function to the TV . If the wireless communication device is a non directional short range wireless communication device such as devices using Bluetooth or ZigBee the program is transmitted to the TV that is previously paired with the remote controller without display function . In the case of the short range wireless communication device it is also possible that the program is automatically transmitted to the paired TV when the RF ID reader reads the program from the RF ID unit without user s pressing of the input unit .

The remote controller without display function may have a display unit such as a LED for notifying the user of that data read by the RF ID reader is stored in the memory . The LED is lit up to encourage the user to press the input unit when the program is read by the RF ID reader and stored in the memory . The LED is lit out when the transmission of the program to the TV is completed. Thereby it is possible to clearly notify the user of that the remote controller without display function holds the program. The LED may be an independent LED or integrated into the input unit .

In the second situation even if the user is far from the TV the program can be executed by the TV by using the remote controller without display function in the user s hand.

In the third and fourth situations if the remote controller with display function has a program execution virtual machine as high function mobile phones called smart phones do the user can select whether the program generated by the image capturing device is executed on the remote controller with display function or the program is transmitted to the TV to be executed on the TV .

When the user moves the image capturing device to bring the RF ID unit to the RF ID reader the RF ID reader reads the program generated by the image capturing device to store the program in the memory .

The following describes the processing performed by the remote controller with display function in more detail with reference to a flowchart of .

First a program read by the RF ID reader is transmitted to the program execution virtual machine and executed by the program execution virtual machine S .

Next a determination is made as to whether or not the remote controller has a display function S . If the remote controller does not have any display function N at S then the program is transmitted to the TV via the transmission unit and then the processing is completed. In this situation the program is executed by the TV .

If the remote controller has a display function Y at S then a further determination is made as to whether or not the remote controller is paired with the TV that is a transmission destination S . If the remote controller is not paired with the TV N at S then a rest processing of the program is executed by the display unit of the remote controller . On the other hand if the remote controller is paired with the TV Y at S then the display unit displays a dialog message Display on TV or on Remote Controller to encourage the user to select one of the options S .

Then the remote controller receives user s entry by the input unit S . A determination is made as to whether or the user selects to display data on the TV S . If the user selects the TV to display data Y at S then the program is transmitted to the TV via the transmission unit and thereby the processing is completed. In this situation the program is executed by the TV . On the other hand if the user selects the remote controller to display data N at S then a rest processing of the program is executed by the remote controller using the display unit S .

It should be noted that the rest processing of the program refers to displaying of a status of a battery a trouble status or an instruction manual regarding the image capturing device but of course not limited to those described in the first embodiment.

With the above structure a program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted to the remote controller with display function then a capability of the remote controller with display function is examined and a determination is made by the remote controller as to which apparatus device is to execute rest processing of the program. Thereby the remote controller does not need to previously install various programs compliant to a plurality of apparatuses. The user can execute the program in his her preferred manner.

It should be noted that it has been described in the first embodiment that the determination is made based on whether or not the remote controller has a display function and based on a pairing status of the remote controller. However it is not limited to the above. A program may execute any determination based on a capability of the apparatus such as a communication capability an audio video reproduction capability a capability of an input unit a capability of an output device and the like.

It should also be noted that it has been described in the first embodiment that the remote controller without display function transmits information to the TV every time one RF ID the image capturing device in this example is read out. However the remote controller without display function may read two or more pieces of RF ID and then transmit all of them to the TV at once. This makes it possible for example that the remote controller obtains pieces of information sequentially from a RF ID attached heat rate meter and also sequentially from RF ID attached Pedometer and then transmits the pieces of information to the TV . Therefore the TV can display a single graph of a history of steps versus a history of a heart rate. If the heat rate meter and the Pedometer store programs individually a program to be executed by the TV may be set to be a program stored in an apparatus device from which information is read last time or may be selected by a user. Or the user may select a device executed by the program. Of course the remote controller with display function may also read two or more pieces of RF ID and then display all of them on the display unit of the remote controller at once.

As described above the storage region of the RF ID unit holds not only information but also a program describing operations of an apparatus device . This considerably simplify changing or updating of a program which has been necessary for conventional techniques to change operations of apparatuses. In addition it is possible to deal with addition of various new functions and an increase of cooperative apparatuses. Moreover proximity communication using RF ID technology is a simple operation achieved by simply bringing a device into proximity of an apparatus which the user can easily understand. Therefore conventional bothersome device operations by using buttons and a menu are simplified. As a result the complicated device operations are changed to be convenient.

The following describes the second embodiment of the present invention. In the second embodiment actual operations of the communication system are described. In the communication system images captured by a camera are uploaded to a server and then downloaded by a simple operation to a TV to be displayed. The whole configuration of the communication system according to the second embodiment is the same as that of the communication system according to the first embodiment.

The second memory updating process of Step S enables the server and the camera to share identification information for distinguishing photographs that have already been uploaded to the server from photographs that have not yet been uploaded to the server . Examples of the uploading process at Step S are given as following cases 1 to 4.

In case 1 the final capturing time final capturing date time is previously stored in the second memory and then updated after the captured images are stored into the third memory Step S .

Comparison of a time of uploading the captured images to the final capturing time of the camera allows the server and the camera to share identification information of the uploaded photographs.

In case 2 the above advantages can be produced also by generating existence identifiers of images not yet been uploaded to the server with reference to images uploaded to the server among the captured images and storing the generated existence identifiers into the second memory Step S .

In case 3 it is also possible that the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is stored in the second memory Step S . Thereby an amount of the information stored in the second memory is reduced thereby saving a capacity of the second memory.

In case 4 it is further possible that image serial numbers are chronologically generated for captured images and thereby the final image serial number in the second memory is updated Step S . Thereby even if a time counted by the camera is not correct it is possible to synchronize information of uploaded photographs between the server and the camera.

The cases 1 to 4 in correspond to the above described cases 1 to 4 of the second memory updating process in respectively.

In case 1 the camera receives from the server a final upload time final upload date time that is a time of finally uploading to the server Step S . Then the camera compares the final upload time to the final capturing time Step S . If the final capturing time is later than the final upload time in other words if there is any image captured after final uploading then the camera uploads to the server any images captured after the final upload time Step S .

In case 2 the camera checks not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers in the second memory Step S . Thereby the camera determines whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded Step S . If there is any image not yet been uploaded then the camera uploads images not yet been uploaded to the server Step S . Then the camera updates the uploaded image information in the second memory Step S .

In case 3 the camera checks the not yet uploaded image information hashed information in the second memory Step S . Thereby the camera determines whether or not the not yet uploaded image information hashed information in the second memory is the same as hashed information that is generated by hashing NULL Step S . If the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is not the same as the hashed information regarding NULL then the camera determines that there is an image not yet been uploaded to the server and therefore uploads to the server any images that are stored in the third memory but have not yet been uploaded to the server Step S .

In case 4 the camera receives from the server an image serial number of a finally uploaded image Step S . Then the camera determines whether or not the image serial number matches the final image serial number in the second memory Step S . If the image serial number does not match the final image serial number then the camera uploads any images having UIDs that are newer than UID of the final image serial number that is received from the server Step S .

First the second antenna embedded in the image capturing device receives weak radio power from polling of the RF ID reader writer of the TV and thereby activates the RF ID unit operated under the second power supply unit S .

The RF ID unit of the image capturing device which is activated by receiving weak power at Step S responds to the polling of the RF ID reader writer of the TV Step S .

After responding to the polling at Step S mutual authentication is performed to determine whether or not the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and the RF ID reader writer of the TV are legitimate devices and also to share a cryptography key used for secure information communication between the image capturing device and the TV Step S . The mutual authentication employs a public key cryptography algorism such as elliptic curve cryptography. In general the employed method for the mutual authentication is the same as that of mutual authentication used in communication via High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI or IEEE1394.

As described earlier at Step S the mutual authentication is performed between the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and the RF ID reader writer of the TV to generate a common cryptography key. After that the server URL generation information is read from the server specific information stored in the second memory readable from the RF ID unit . The server URL generation information is transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S . The server URL generation information includes the server address information indicating address information of the server the user identification information that is the login ID to the server and the password that is a login password to the server . The password is important information for preventing unauthorized acts of a malicious third person. Therefore the password is sometimes encrypted beforehand as the encrypted password to be stored and then transmitted to the TV .

After the server URL generation information is transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV at Step S the captured image state information stored in the second memory is also transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S . The captured image state information is the final capturing time case 1 the existence identifiers which are existence identification information regarding images not yet been uploaded and each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded case 2 the not yet uploaded image information hashed information case 3 or the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to captured images case 4 . The captured image state information is important for examining synchronization between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

In case 1 the final capturing time is used as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV compares the final capturing time to the final upload time. If the final capturing time is temporally later than the final upload time that is a time of finally uploading to the server then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case 2 the captured image state information is the existence identifiers each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded. Therefore the TV examines the existence identifiers to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case 3 the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is employed as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV examines the not yet uploaded image information hashed information to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case 4 the captured image state information is the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images. Therefore the TV compares a the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images to b an image serial number of an image finally uploaded to the server . Here the final image serial number is provided from the image capturing device while the image serial number is provided from the server . Based on the comparison the TV can determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

After transmitting the captured image state information from the second antenna of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV at Step S the image display method instruction information is also transmitted from the second memory of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S . The image display method instruction information is identification information indicating how the display unit of the TV is to display the images downloaded from the server . The image display method instruction information includes the list display indicator indicating that the images are to be displayed in a list and the slide show indicator indicating that the images are to be displayed as a slide show.

As described above at Steps S to S the image capturing device transmits the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which are stored in the second memory of the image capturing device from the second antenna of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV . Here it is desirable to encrypt all of the above pieces of information to be transmitted by using the cryptography key information shared between the image capturing device and the TV at the mutual authentication. The encryption achieves secure information communication between the image capturing device and the TV . As a result intervention of a malicious third person can be prevented.

Since the server URL generation information is transmitted to the TV the server and directory to which the first antenna of the image capturing device transmits data is the same as the server and directory from which the TV downloads the data. Therefore the TV can display the images that have been captured by the image capturing device and then uploaded to the server .

In addition the transmission of the captured image state information to the TV makes it possible to examine synchronization between the captured images stored in the third memory of the image capturing device and the images uploaded from the first antenna to the server . Therefore the TV can detect a failure of the synchronization. The display of the warning information indicating the synchronization failure on the TV can prevent unnecessary confusion of the user.

Moreover the transmission of the image display method instruction information to the TV enables the user to view images by a set image viewing method without designating the image viewing method on the TV . The user merely needs to move the image capturing device into proximity of the TV . The complicated operations using a remote controller or the like of the TV are not necessary. The images can be automatically displayed by the set viewing method.

The TV according to the second embodiment includes the RF ID reader writer the decryption unit a URL generation unit a communication unit a transmission unit a communication interface a receiving unit a data processing unit a memory unit a display unit and a CPU .

The RF ID reader writer communicates with the RF ID unit of the image capturing device via the second antenna . The RF ID reader writer includes a wireless antenna a receiving unit and a communicable device search unit polling unit .

The wireless antenna performs proximity wireless communication with the second antenna of the image capturing device . The wireless antenna has the same structure as that of wireless antennas of general purpose RF ID reader writers.

The communicable device search unit polling unit performs polling to check a RF ID unit of each of plural cameras in order to examine whether to have any transmission request or processing request . If the communicable device search unit receives a response of the polling from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device the corresponding camera then the mutual authentication is performed to share a common cryptography key between the TV and the image capturing device .

When the mutual authentication is completed after receiving the polling response the receiving unit receives the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information from the second memory via the second antenna of the image capturing device .

The decryption unit decrypts the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which are received by the receiving unit . The decryption of the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which have been encrypted is performed using the cryptography key shared between the image capturing device and the TV after the mutual authentication by the communicable device search unit polling unit .

The URL generation unit generates based on the server URL generation information a URL to access the server and then transmits the generated URL to the communication unit. The URL includes not only the server specific information but also the login ID and the password used to login to the server.

The communication unit communicates with the server via a general purpose network using the communication interface .

The transmission unit transmits the URL generated by the URL generation unit via the communication interface in order to connect the TV to the server .

The communication interface is a communication interface for connecting the TV to the server via a general purpose network. The communication interface is for example a wired wireless LAN interface.

The receiving unit receives downloads image data and an image display cascading style sheet CSS from the serer connected by the communication interface .

The data processing unit performs data processing for the image data downloaded by the receiving unit . If the image data to be downloaded is compressed data the data processing unit de compresses the image data. If the image data is encrypted the data processing unit decrypts the image data. In addition the data processing unit can arrange the downloaded image data by an image display style based on the image display CSS. If it is determined based on the captured image state information obtained if necessary by decryption of the decryption unit that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server then the data processing unit causes the display unit to display warning information regarding the synchronization failure. Thereby unnecessary confusion of the user can be prevented. Moreover the data processing unit sets a mode of displaying the downloaded image data according to the image display method instruction information provided from the decryption unit . For example if the list display flag in the image display method instruction information is ON then the data processing unit generates a list of the downloaded images and provides the list to the memory unit . If the slide show flag in the image display method instruction information is ON then the data processing unit generates a slide show of the downloaded images and provides the slide show to the memory unit .

The memory unit is a memory that temporarily holds the image data processed by the data processing unit .

The display unit displays the image data stored in the memory unit . The image data has been downloaded from the server and applied with data processing by the data processing unit as described earlier.

As descried above based on the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which are received from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device the TV according to the second embodiment of the present invention can be connected to the server then download the uploaded image data from the server and display the downloaded image data on the display unit . Thereby the user does not need to do complicated processes of removing the third memory such as a Secure Digital SD card or a flash memory from the image capturing device and equipping the third memory to a card reader of the TV in order to view captured images. In the second embodiment of the present invention the user can display and view captured image data by simple operations of simply presenting the RF ID unit of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV for proximity communication. The second embodiment of the present invention can provide a captured image viewing system by which even users who are not familiar with operations of digital devices can easily view image data.

First the communicable device search unit in the RF ID reader writer of the TV transmits a polling signal to search for the RF ID unit of the communicable image capturing device Step S .

When the image capturing device receives the polling signal from the communicable device search unit in the RF ID reader writer of the TV the second power supply unit is supplied with power to activate operate the RF ID unit Step S . Here at least the RF ID unit which can be operated under the second power supply unit is activated. It is not necessary to activate all functions in the image capturing device .

When the activation of the RF ID unit of the image capturing device is completed at Step S the image capturing device transmits a polling response for the polling to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S .

After the image capturing device responds to the polling at Step S the TV receives the polling response by the wireless antenna of the RF ID reader writer Step S .

After receiving the polling response at Step S the TV determines whether or not the image capturing device transmitting the polling response is a device mutually communicable with the TV Step S . If the determination is made that the image capturing device cannot mutually communicate with the TV then the processing is completed. On the other hand if the determination is made that the image capturing device is mutually communicable with the TV then the processing proceeds to Step S.

If the determination is made that the image capturing device is mutually communicable with the TV at Step S then the TV performs mutual authentication to determine whether or not the image capturing device and the TV are legitimate devices for communication Step S . The mutual authentication is the same as general mutual authentication using HDMI or IEEE1394. In the mutual authentication issuing of challenge data and checking of response data are performed plural times between the TV and the image capturing device to eventually generate a common cryptography key. If one of the TV and the image capturing device is not legitimate the common cryptography key is not generated thereby disabling future mutual communication.

The image capturing device also performs the same mutual authentication in the RF ID unit . Generation and transmission of challenge data and receiving and checking of response data are performed plural times between the TV and the image capturing device to eventually generate a cryptography key identical to the cryptography key generated by the TV Step S .

When the mutual authentication is completed at Step S the image capturing device reads the server URL generation information as the server specific information from the second memory then encrypts the server URL generation information using the common cryptography key generated at the mutual authentication and transmits the encrypted server URL generation information to the RF ID reader writer of the TV Step S .

The TV receives the encrypted server URL generation information transmitted at Step S by the receiving unit in the RF ID reader writer . Then the decryption unit decrypts the encrypted server URL generation information using the common cryptography key. Based on the server URL generation information the URL generation unit generates a URL to access the server . Then the TV transmits to the image capturing device a notification of completion of receiving the server URL generation information Step S .

After the notification of the receiving completion is transmitted at Step S the image capturing device receives the notification by the second antenna . Then the image capturing device reads the captured image state information from the second memory to transmit the captured image state information to the TV Step S . The captured image state information is the final capturing time case 1 the existence identifiers which are existence identification information regarding images not yet been uploaded and each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded case 2 the not yet uploaded image information hashed information case 3 or the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to captured images case 4 . The captured image state information is important for examining synchronization between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

After the image capturing device transmits the captured image state information at Step S the TV receives the captured image state information by the RF ID reader writer and then transmits to the image capturing device a notification of completion of receiving the captured image state information Step S . Here the CPU in the TV performs the following processing depending on kinds of the received captured image state information .

In case 1 the final capturing time is used as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV compares the final capturing time to the final upload time that is a time of finally uploading to the server . If the final capturing time is temporally later than the final upload time then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case 2 the captured image state information is the existence identifiers each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded. Therefore the TV examines the existence identifiers to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case 3 the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is employed as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV examines the not yet uploaded image information hashed information to determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case 4 the captured image state information is the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images. Therefore the TV compares a the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images to b an image serial number of an image finally uploaded to the server . Here the final image serial number is provided from the image capturing device while the image serial number is provided from the server . Based on the comparison the TV can determine whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded. If there is any image not yet been uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

After the TV completes receiving of the captured image state information and transmits the notification of the receipt to the image capturing device at Step S the image capturing device reads the image display method instruction information from the second memory and transmits the image display method instruction information to the TV Step S . The image display method instruction information includes the list display flag and the slide show flag .

After the image display method instruction information is transmitted at Step S the TV receives the image display method instruction information by the RF ID reader writer of the TV and transmits a notification of completion of receiving the image display method instruction information to the image capturing device Step S . The data processing unit of the TV generates a mode of displaying images downloaded from the server based on the received image display method instruction information . For example if the list display flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a list of the downloaded images and stores the generated list in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the list. On the other hand if the slide show flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a slide show of the downloaded images and stores the generated slide show in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the slide show.

After receiving the image display method instruction information at Step S the TV disconnects communication from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device Step S .

Next the TV activates a TV system Step S . The activation of the TV system refers to turning the main power of the TV N to display the downloaded image data on the display unit . Prior to the activation of the TV system at Step S at least the RF ID reader writer of the TV is activated and the display unit may be turned OFF.

Then the communication unit is activated to connect the TV to the server based on the URL generated by the URL generation unit Step S .

After connecting to the server at Step S the TV downloads uploaded image data from the server Step S .

The data processing unit generates to be displayed image data from the images downloaded at the Step S based on the image display method instruction information obtained from the camera the image capturing device then stores the generated image data into the memory unit and displays the image data on the display unit Step S . The data processing unit of the TV generates a mode of displaying the images image data downloaded from the server based on the received image display method instruction information . For example if the list display flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a list of the downloaded images and stores the generated list in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the list. On the other hand if the slide show flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a slide show of the downloaded images and stores the generated slide show in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the slide show.

After displaying of the images downloaded from the server is completed at Step S the TV performs synchronization examination to determine whether or not the captured images recorded in the third memory of the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images downloaded from the server Step S . The synchronization examination is performed based on the captured image state information provided at Step S from the image capturing device . The captured image state information is the final capturing time case 1 the existence identifiers which are existence identification information regarding images not yet been uploaded and each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded case 2 the not yet uploaded image information hashed information case 3 or the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to captured images case 4 . The captured image state information is important for examining synchronization between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

First the communication unit of the 45 receives from the server date time of finally uploading to the server hereinafter referred to also as a final upload date time that may be date time of capturing a final image among uploaded images to produce the same advantages Step S .

Next the TV compares the final upload date time to a final capturing date time Step S . The final capturing date time which is date time of final capturing of the image capturing device is indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer . If the final upload date time is prior to the final capturing date time it is determined that there is an image captured after the final upload and not yet been uploaded to the server . Therefore a determination is made that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server . Then warning information is displayed at Step S. On the other hand if the final upload date time is equal to the final capturing date time it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined at Step S that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure. Here if time information is generated by comparing the final upload date time to the final capturing date time in order to indicate from when captured images are not uploaded and the generated time information is presented as a message together with the warning information the warning information is convenient for the user.

First it is determined based on the existence identifiers of the not yet uploaded image existence identification information whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded to the server from among the captured images stored in the third memory of the image capturing device Step S . Here the existence identifiers are indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer . If it is determined that there is an image not yet been uploaded to the server at Step S then the processing proceed to Step S to display warning information. On the other hand if there is not image not yet been uploaded it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure at Step S.

First it is determined based on the not yet uploaded image information hashed information whether or not there is any image not yet been uploaded to the server from among the captured images stored in the third memory of the image capturing device Step S . Here the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer . The determination of Step S is performed by comparing the not yet uploaded image information hashed information to a hashed value generated by hashing NULL generated in the TV . If it is determined that there is an image not yet been uploaded at Step S then the processing proceed to Step S to display warning information. On the other hand if there is no image not yet been uploaded it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure at Step S.

First the communication unit of the TV receives from the server an image serial number of an image finally uploaded to the server Step S .

Next the TV compares a the image serial number of the image finally uploaded which is provided form the server to b a final image serial number of an image finally captured which is indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device by the RF ID reader writer Step S . If the mage serial number of the image finally uploaded is smaller than the mage serial number of the image finally captured it is determined that there is an image captured after the final upload and not yet been uploaded to the server . Therefore a determination is made that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the processing proceeds to Step S to display warning information. On the other hand if the mage serial number of the image finally uploaded is identical to the mage serial number of the image finally captured it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined at Step S that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure.

When all of images captured by the image capturing device are not uploaded to the serve in other words when images captured by the image capturing device are not in synchronization with images uploaded to the server any of above cases 1 to 4 makes it possible to detect the synchronization failure. Thereby although all of the captured images cannot be displayed on the display unit a convenient message can be displayed to the user to inform the synchronization failure. As a result unnecessary confusion of the user can be prevented.

First 1 a data format in uploading captured images from the image capturing device to the server is described. The data format includes camera ID a sever address a server login ID a server login password an image directory and an uploading image number .

The camera ID is camera UID uniquely assigned to each camera image capturing device . The camera ID is ID information recorded in the camera ID in the second memory of the image capturing device . Use of the camera ID as login ID to the server can provide a server address unique to each image capturing device so that the image capturing device can access the server without user s entry of login ID. In addition the camera ID enables the server to manage captured images for each capturing camera.

The sever address is included in the server address information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The sever address enables the TV to identify the server to which target image data is uploaded.

The server login ID is included in the login ID in the user identification information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login ID allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The server login password is included in the password in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login password allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The uploading image number is the number of images to be uploaded to the server. The uploading image number is equal to the number of images which is stored as the not yet uploaded image number in the second memory of the image capturing device . After capturing images the number of images not yet been uploaded is indicated in the uploading image number .

After transmitting the data format the image capturing device uploads to the server the images that are stored in the third memory of the image capturing device but not yet been uploaded to the server .

Next 2 a data format used in RF ID communication between the image capturing device and the TV is described. The data format includes camera ID a sever address a server login ID a server login password a final capturing date time final capturing time and not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers not yet uploaded image information hashed information a final image serial number and image display method instruction information .

The camera ID is a camera UID uniquely assigned to each camera image capturing device . The camera ID is ID information recorded in the camera ID in the second memory of the image capturing device . Use of the camera ID as login ID to the server from the TV can provide a server address unique to each image capturing device so that the TV can access the server without user s entry of login ID. The camera ID may be used in the mutual authentication between the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and the RF ID reader writer of the TV .

The sever address is included in the server address information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The sever address enables the TV to identify the server to which target image data is uploaded.

The server login ID is included in the login ID in the user identification information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login ID allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The server login password is included in the password in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login password allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The final capturing date time corresponds to the final capturing time in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the final capturing date time for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

The not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers correspond to the not yet uploaded image data existence identification information in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . TV uses the not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server . In order to implement each of the not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers each image ID for identifying a corresponding one of captured images is assigned with an upload flag indicating whether or not the corresponding image has been uploaded to the server . Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not each of the captured images has been uploaded to the server .

The not yet uploaded image information hashed information corresponds to the not yet uploaded image information hashed information in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the not yet uploaded image information hashed information for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

The final image serial number corresponds to the final image serial number in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the final image serial number for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

The image display method instruction information corresponds to the image display method instruction information in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The image display method instruction information includes identification information by which the TV designates a method of viewing images downloaded from the server .

For each image ID the image display method instruction information includes a list display flag a slide show flag a print flag a video reproduction flag a download flag and a security password .

The image ID is information unique to a captured image. The pieces of image ID are chronologically assigned to captured images by the image capturing device in capturing the images.

The list display flag corresponds to the list display flag stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the list display flag to determine whether or not image data downloaded from the server is to be displayed in a list format. If the list display flag indicates yes the data processing unit of the TV generates a list of the downloaded images stores the list to the memory unit and then displays the list on the display unit .

The slide show flag corresponds to the slide show flag stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the slide show flag to determine whether or not image data downloaded from the server is to be displayed as a slide show. If the slide show flag indicates automatic the data processing unit of the TV generates a slide show of the downloaded images stores the slide show to the memory unit and then displays the slide show on the display unit . If the slide show flag indicates manual the TV permits execution of the slide show according to instructions from the user. If the slide show flag indicates disable the TV inhibits display of the slide show.

The print flag indicates whether or not images to be downloaded to the TV and then displayed on the display unit are permitted to be printed by a printer not shown connected to the TV . The print flag is not shown in the image display method instruction information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . However if the print flag is added it is possible to set whether or not image data is printable. As a result usability related to use of images can be improved.

The video reproduction flag indicates whether or not video data captured by the image capturing device and then uploaded to the server is permitted to be downloaded by the TV and then viewed. If the image capturing device has a video capturing function addition of the video reproduction flag to the image display method instruction information stored in the second memory can add setting of whether or not video reproduction is permitted. As a result the video reproduction can be managed without complicated operations by the user.

The download flag is an identifier indicating whether or not image or video uploaded to the server is permitted to be downloaded copied to a memory in the TV . The download flag can prevent that the image or video is copied by the third person to which image capturing is not permitted. Thereby copy right protection is also achieved.

The security password is password information that permits only the authorized user to perform the above described image viewing printing and downloading processes. In the second embodiment the same password is set for each of the above described image viewing printing and downloading processes. It is preferable however to set a different password to each of image viewing printing and downloading processes so that a level of security can be set independently.

As described above in the system according to the second embodiment of the present invention the image capturing device uploads captured images to the server connected to the image capturing device via the first antenna. When the image capturing device is prevented to the RF ID reader writer of the TV the image capturing device transmits the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information from the RF ID unit to the TV by the RF ID communication. Then the TV connects to the server to which the image capturing device has uploaded the captured images then downloads the captured images from the server and displays the captured images. Here it is determined whether or not the captured images in the server are in synchronization with the captured images in the image capturing device . If the synchronization is failure the TV displays notification of the synchronization failure on the display unit . Thereby the user can display the captured images only by presenting the image capturing device to the TV although the user conventionally has to remove a recording memory from the camera the image capturing device to be equipped to the TV in order to view the images. Thereby even the user who is not familiar with operations of digital devices can easily display the images on the TV .

First the third embodiment is explained in summary. is a schematic block diagram of an electronic catalog display system according to the third embodiment. The electronic catalog display system according to the third embodiment includes an electronic catalog server information input device an electronic catalog notification card the TV and an electronic catalog server . The electronic catalog server information input device includes a RF ID writer . The electronic catalog notification card includes a RF ID unit . The TV includes a RF ID reader and a network communication unit . The electronic catalog server includes an electronic catalog database and a customer attribute database .

The electronic catalog server information input device writes electronic catalog server information from the RF ID writer to the RF ID unit attached to the electronic catalog notification card . The electronic catalog server information is provided from a user who provides services of an electronic catalog hereinafter referred to as a provider user . When a user who receives the services of the electronic catalog hereinafter referred to as a customer user brings the electronic catalog notification card in which the electronic catalog server information is written into proximity of the TV the RF ID reader in the TV reads the electronic catalog server information from the RF ID unit . In addition the TV transmits based on the readout electronic catalog server information a request for obtaining an electronic catalog to the electronic catalog server set on a network via the network communication unit . Furthermore when transmitting the request to the electronic catalog server the TV transmits also user information which is previously inputted in the TV to the electronic catalog server . The electronic catalog server receives the request for the electronic catalog and the user information from the TV . First the electronic catalog server obtains customer attribute data from the customer attribute database based on the user information. Next from the electronic catalog database the electronic catalog server obtains electronic catalog data associated with the customer attribute data. Then the electronic catalog server transmits the obtained electronic catalog data to the TV from which the request for the electronic catalog has been transmitted. The TV displays the electronic catalog data received from the electronic catalog server and thereby receives purchase operations from the customer user to purchase products in the electronic catalog data.

The following describes the electronic catalog display system according to the third embodiment in more detail.

The following describes processing of the TV after downloading the electronic catalog data with reference to a flowchart of . The processing regarding obtaining of the electronic catalog server information from the RF ID unit at Steps S to S is the same whichever the electronic catalog data is downloaded or not. At S it is determined whether or not the electronic catalog data associated with the electronic catalog server information received from the RF ID unit has already been downloaded and displayed. If the electronic catalog data has not yet been downloaded then the TV downloads the electronic catalog data from the server at S and displays the electronic catalog data at S. The download processing is the same as the download processing described in the first embodiment.

If it is determined at S that the electronic catalog data has already been downloaded then the TV issues a signal of a predetermined key for example a signal of a Decide key to execute operations for the displayed electronic catalog data S . Here as illustrated in an example of a screen display of the electronic catalog data in a screen presents the customer user with a few of options for a next operation to be executed by the customer user for the displayed electronic catalog data. Then a focus circulates among the options on the screen as illustrated as options and in to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. This allows the customer user to execute an operation for selecting or purchasing each product in the electronic catalog data for example only by presenting the electronic catalog notification card having the RF ID unit to the TV when the focus indicates a desired option of the customer user.

The second memory according to the third embodiment which is embedded in the RF ID unit on the electronic catalog notification card may be a Read Only Memory ROM . In this aspect the electronic catalog server information input device serves as a RF ID memory data input unit in manufacturing the RF ID unit or a RF ID memory data input means in a RF ID manufacturing system. In general a RF ID unit having a ROM unit is inexpensive more than a RF ID unit having a rewritable memory. Therefore the RF ID unit having a ROM allows the provider user sending a great number of electronic catalog notification cards to reduce a cost.

It should be noted that it has been described in the third embodiment that a focus circulates among the options on the screen of the TV as illustrated as options and in to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. However the method of operating the electronic catalog data displayed on the screen by using the electronic catalog notification card having the RF ID unit is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that the receiving unit of the TV sequentially receive pieces of information from the RF ID unit and counts the sequential receiving processes then thereby calculates a time period RF ID proximity time period during which the RF ID unit is in proximity of the TV and eventually moves a focus indicating a selection candidate displayed on the screen based on the RF ID proximity time period. With the above structure the following operation for the electronic catalog is possible. Only when the RF ID unit is in proximity of the TV the focus displayed on the screen is circulated to change the selection candidate. If the RF ID unit is away from the TV the focus is stopped. After a predetermined time period after stopping of the focus the selection candidate on which the focus is stopped is decided as selection. In this operation for the electronic catalog the customer user can actively operate the electronic catalog by using the RF ID unit without waiting for the focus which automatically circulates among options every predetermined time period to arrive at a user s desired option.

It should also be noted that it has been described in the third embodiment that the electronic catalog server information input device has the key input receiving unit which receives inputs by the input keys operated by the provider user in order to obtain the electronic catalog server information. However the following configuration is also possible. That is the electronic catalog server information input device has a communication interface to communicate with the image server. The image server holds the server information to be transmitted to the electronic catalog server information input device . The electronic catalog server information input device receives the server information from the image server in order to obtain the server information. This configuration in which the server information is stored in the image server allows the electronic catalog server information input device to eliminate inputting to the image server. Especially when a plurality of the electronic catalog server information input devices are operated for a single image server this configuration is highly convenient.

The conventional techniques have a program that users who are not familiar with operations of digital devices such as personal computers should learn operations of the devices to do online shopping. However the system according to the third embodiment enables users using electronic catalogs to do online shopping and the like simply by bringing received cards or post cards into proximity of TVs. Therefore even users who are not familiar with online terminals such as personal computers and mobile phones can easily enjoy shopping on TV screens.

The structure and processing of the image capturing device according to the fourth embodiment are the same as described in the first embodiment.

It should be noted that it has been described in the fourth embodiment that the user inputs the destination information to the TV but the user may input not only the destination information such as an address and a name but also a message to be printed with an image on a post card. The TV receives the input message together with the destination information and provides them to the image server . The printer prints them on the post card. in illustrates an example of a screen of the TV on which a message to be printed is inputted. If the user can select an image to be printed on the post card and also input an message added to the image a flexibility in generating a post card with RF ID is increased.

It should also be noted that the TV according to the fourth embodiment may allow the user to perform operations for images displayed on the TV by using the post card with RF ID in the same manner as described in the third embodiment for the processing in which the user operates an electronic catalog displayed on a screen by using RF ID.

As described above the system according to the fourth embodiment enables the user to mail a post card with RF ID to a person living in a distant location without creating a post card attached with RF ID by the user himself herself. In addition when the user wishes to print the image s stored in the image server onto the post card to be mailed the system allows the user to perform operation on a TV screen to select an image s to be printed. As a result high usability is achieved.

Conventionally if the user intends to show images on a large screen display device to a different user living in a remote location the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device apparatus an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. The system according to the fourth embodiment however enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation for example by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF ID into proximity of a display device.

The fifth embodiment of the present invention has the following configuration. A mailing object such as a post card is written with fixed information. The image capturing device associates the fixed information with an image or a group of images image data stored in the server. A reproduction side reads the fixed information from the RF ID attached to the post card or the like in order to display the image data associated with the fixed information. The configuration is illustrated in . Referring to first the image capturing device reads the fixed information from the mailing object then associates the fixed information with an image s and registers information of the association hereinafter referred to as association information into the server. When the user receives the mailing object for which the registration is completed the user brings the mailing object into proximity of a RF ID reader of a TV to read the fixed information from the mailing object. The TV queries the server using the fixed information and thereby displays the image s associated with the mailing object.

The fifth embodiment is characterized in that the RF ID information in the mailing object is not rewritable ROM or in non rewritable environments so that image data in the server is associated with the mailing object without rewriting the fixed information in the mailing object.

The images captured by the image capturing device are uploaded to the server using the method described in the prior embodiments. Here an identifier is assigned to an uploaded image or image group. The identifier makes it possible to identify the image or an group of images stored in the server.

The following describes a method of associating i an image or image group which is captured and uploaded to the server by the image capturing device with ii fixed information recorded in a RF ID tag of a mailing object. illustrate examples of the fixed information recorded in the RF ID tag of the mailing object. illustrates fixed information including mailing object UID unique to the mailing object and information such as an address for accessing the image server. illustrates fixed information including the mailing object UID and information such as an address for accessing a relay server. illustrates fixed information including the mailing object UID only. The fixed information may also include a login ID password information and the like for accessing the server. It is assumed in the fifth embodiment that such information necessary to access the server is included in a URL including the address information.

First the image capturing device reads information from the RF ID of the mailing object by using the RF ID reader S . In more detail the second antenna illustrated in communicates with the RF ID of the mailing object and thereby the data receiving unit receives the fixed information from mailing object. Then the second processing unit performs processing to provide the fixed information of the mailing object to the first processing unit via the recording unit the second memory and the recording reproducing unit . The first processing unit associates the mailing object UID read from the mailing object with an image or image group according to designation from the user S . Then the image capturing device accesses the server via the first antenna S . Thereby the image capturing device registers to the server the association information regarding the association between the mailing object UID and the image data stored in the server S .

If the fixed information read from the mailing object includes an address of the image server or a URL including the address then the processing is completed. On the other hand if the fixed information read from the mailing object does not include an address of the image server or a URL including the address the image capturing device sets a relay server .

In order to set a relay server the image capturing device accesses the relay server S . In more detail if the fixed information read from the mailing object includes an address of a relay server or a URL including the address then the image capturing device accesses the relay server. Otherwise the image capturing device accesses a relay server that is previously set for the image capturing device.

After accessing the relay server the image capturing device sets in a database of the relay server association information regarding association between the mailing object UID and the server that is a redirection destination transfer destination S . Thereby association between the mailing object UID and an address of the transfer destination is registered in the database of the relay server.

If the image capturing device does not have a RF ID reader function and the mailing object is printed with a two dimensional code or the like indicating information of the RF ID reader the image capturing device captures an image of the two dimensional code using an image capturing unit to read information from the code so that the image capturing device can obtain the same information as the fixed information recorded in the RF ID unit of the mailing object. The two dimensional code may be a QR Code a PDF417 Veri Code Maxi Code or the like. Any other code can be used if the image capturing device can read information from the code by capturing an image of the code. In addition the same advantages as described in the fifth embodiment can be produced by using a bar code in a one dimensional direction only although a printing area is increased.

The following describes a flow of the processing from reading the information of the two dimensional code to associating the information with an image or image group in the server with reference to .

Firstly the image capturing unit captures an image of the two dimensional code S . Then it is determined whether or not the captured image is a two dimensional code S . If the captured image is not a two dimensional code then error processing is performed S . Or normal image capturing processing may be performed. On the other hand if the captured image is a two dimensional code then the two dimensional code is analyzed S . Thereby information is read from the mailing object based on the result of the analysis S . After reading the fixed information from the mailing object the image capturing device associates the mailing object UID with image data stored in the server S . Then the image capturing device accesses the server S . Then the image capturing device sets the association information to the server S . The Steps S to S are the same as the Steps S to S in . Here if the readout information does not include an address of the image server or a URL including the address then the image capturing device performs transfer setting to a relay server. The transfer setting to the relay server has been previously described with reference to .

As described above by reading information from the two dimensional bar code printed on the mailing object it is possible to complete to associate the information recorded on the RF ID unit with image data stored in the server.

If the image capturing device does not have a RF ID reader function and the mailing object is not printed with a code such as a two dimensional code the image capturing device can read information from the mailing object if the user manually inputs to the image capturing device the mailing object UID and the URL such as a sever address which are printed on the mailing object. The user inputs the information using buttons to illustrated in . In this aspect the URL and the mailing object UID may be printed directly as a plane text or coded to be a code which the user easily inputs.

As described above even if the image capturing device does not have a RF ID reader function and the mailing object is not printed with a two dimensional code it is possible to associate the mailing object with image data stored in the server.

Next the steps for viewing images stored in the server on the TV using the mailing object for which association is completed.

When the user brings the mailing object into proximity of the RF ID reader of the TV the TV reads information of the RF ID on the mailing object S . Then a determination is made as to whether or not the readout information includes a sever address or a URL including the server address S . If the readout information includes a sever address or a URL including the sever address then the TV accesses the designated server S . Then the TV transmits the mailing object UID S . Then a determination is made as to whether or not the server receiving the transmission is a relay server S . If the server is a relay server then the relay server redirects to a server the image sever designated in the relay server S . Thereby the TV accesses an image or image group in the image server S . On the other hand if it is determined at S that the server receiving the transmission is the image server then redirecting is not performed and access to the image server is performed S . Moreover if it is determined at S that the readout information does not include a sever address then the TV accesses a server set by a predetermined default S . Then the TV transmits the mailing object UID to the default server S . The default server redirects to a server the image server designated in the default server S to access the image server.

Here if association between the mailing object UID and the designated server as a destination of the relay is not registered in a database of the relay or default server the relay or default server redirects to an error page. is a flowchart of processing performed by the relay or default server after receiving the mailing object UID. When the relay or default server receives the mailing object UID S the server searches its database for information regarding the mailing object UID S . Then the relay or default server determines whether or not the database holds information regarding the mailing object UID S . If the database holds the information then the relay or default server redirects to a server associated with the mailing object UID in the database S . On the other hand if the database does not hold the information in other words if there is no association then the relay or default server redirects to an error page S .

As described above the mailing object having fixed information in the RF ID is previously associated with image data stored in the image server. Thereby when the mailing object with the association is presented to the TV the user can view an image or image group in the server which is associated with the mailing object UID without rewriting of the RF ID of the mailing object. Therefore even if the user is away from home and cannot rewrite the RF ID of the mailing object or even if the RF ID of the mailing object is not rewritable the user can associate images in the server with the mailing object. As a result the user allows a person receiving the mailing object to view the images associated with the mailing object.

It should be noted that it has been described in the fifth embodiment that the mailing object UID is transmitted after accessing the server. However it is also possible to generate a URL from the mailing object UID and the sever address recorded on the mailing object in order to access the server. In this aspect it is possible to perform the access to the server and the transmission of the mailing object UID at the same time.

According to the fifth embodiment even in an environment where the RF ID cannot be rewritten such as in a sight seeing location for example the user can associate captured images with a post card and send the post card to a friend. Thereby the friend receiving the post card presents the post card to a TV to view the images the user captured in the sight seeing location. As explained above even in an environment where the RF ID cannot be rewritten the user can create a mailing object associated with images in the server and then send the mailing object to a person to which the user desires to show the images.

If the image capturing device has a RF ID writer function to rewrite the RF ID of the mailing object the processing is the same as processing performed by the TV for associating the mailing object with image data in the server which will be described below in the sixth embodiment. Therefore the processing is not described in the fifth embodiment.

In the sixth embodiment the following configuration is described. The image capturing device captures images and uploads the images to the image server. Then a user transmitting the images hereinafter referred to as a sending user selects an image group from the images in the server. Information for accessing the selected image group is recorded in the RF ID on the mailing object. The mailing object is mailed to a user receiving the images hereinafter referred to as a receiving user . The receiving user accesses the image group in the image server by using the RF ID on the mailing object.

In a mailing object is a post card envelope or letter paper which is mailed from the image transmission side to the image receiving side. A RF ID unit is a rewritable RF ID. At least part of the RF ID unit is a rewritable memory unit . The RF ID unit is attached to or incorporated into the mailing object in order to be sent to the image receiving side together with the mailing object.

As described in the prior embodiments the memory unit in the RF ID unit holds the medium identification information for identifying that the medium having the RF ID unit is a mailing object.

Referring to a TV is a TV display device provided in the image receiving side. The TV has the same function as that of the TV in described in the prior embodiments. Like the TV in the TV includes a RF ID reader writer corresponding to the RF ID reader writer in and a display unit corresponding to the display unit in . The TV is connected to the Internet via a network connection means not shown.

In the image transmission side in images captured by the image capturing device are transmitted to a wireless access point via the second antenna in the image capturing device used for wireless communication such as a wireless LAN or WiMAX. The images are recorded as the image data onto the image server via the internet . Then the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to establish connection with the TV by wireless communication via the first antenna of the image capturing device used for RF ID. The TV obtains from the image capturing device information for accessing the image data in the image server . Then the TV downloads the images of the image data to be displayed on the display unit . The above processing is the same as described in the prior embodiments. The above is just a summary.

Next the sending user checks the images displayed on the display unit of the TV in order to set transmission image selection information indicating whether or not each of the images is to be transmitted to the receiving user in other words whether or not each of the images is to be permitted to be viewed by the receiving user . The sending user can set also restriction on display for the receiving user utility form information such as a slide show and printing which is described in the prior embodiments. The transmission image selection information and the utility form information are transmitted to and recorded onto the image server. The image server manages as an image group a set of images selected as transmission images in the transmission image selection information.

The following describes steps performed by the TV for recording onto the mailing object information regarding the image group selected by the sending use with reference to a flowchart of .

It is assumed that transmission images have been selected and an image group set with the utility form information has been generated. Under the assumption the sending user brings the mailing object having the RF ID unit into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to establish wireless communication between the RF ID unit and the RF ID reader writer .

When the TV becomes able to communicate with the RF ID unit on the mailing object via the RF ID reader writer the TV reads information from the memory unit S . Then the TV determines whether or not the medium identification information indicates that the current communication partner is a mailing object S . If the current communication partner is a mailing object then the TV proceeds to steps for writing to the mailing object. Here if it is determined at Step S that the current communication partner is not a mailing object then the subsequent steps are not described here but the TV proceeds to steps depending on a medium indicated by the medium identification information.

In order to write to the mailing object first the TV accesses the image server via the internet S . Thereby the TV obtains from the image server image group designation information such as a server URL and an image group address for allowing the image receiving side to access the image group in the image server S .

The TV transmits the obtained image group designation information to the RF ID unit on the mailing object via the RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to write the image group designation information to the memory unit in the mailing object and the RF ID unit on the mailing object records the image group designation information to a rewritable region of the memory unit S .

As described above the mailing object on which the image group designation information is recorded is mailed by the sending user to a user of the image receiving side.

Next the image receiving side is described with reference to illustrating the schematic block diagram of the image receiving side and illustrating a flowchart of processing performed by the TV in the image receiving side.

Referring to the receiving user receives the mailing object from the sending user. Then the receiving user checks the RF ID unit or characters or design indicated on the mailing object to determine whether the mailing object is incorporated with a means for accessing images. Here the receiving user needs only to understand that the receiving user can access to the images by using the mailing object . The receiving user does not need to care about the image group designation information and the like in the RF ID unit .

In order to reproduce and view the images the receiving user brings the mailing object into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV in the image receiving side so as to start viewing of the images.

If the RF ID unit on the mailing object is in enough proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the RF ID unit of the mailing object via antennas not shown of both the RF ID reader writer and the RF ID unit in order to activate the RF ID unit . Thereby wireless communication between the TV and the RF ID unit of the mailing object starts. When the wireless communication starts the TV reads information from the memory unit of the RF ID unit S .

A determination is made as to whether or not the medium identification information in the readout information indicates that the current communication partner is a mailing object S . If the current communication partner is a mailing object then the TV proceeds to processing of reading the image group designated by the sending user from the image server .

The access to the image server makes it possible to generate an URL for accessing the image group in the image server by using the image group designation information in the information read by the RF ID unit at Step S such as an image group address and thereby to access the image server via the internet S .

The TV connected to the image server at the above step obtains the images the image group which are permitted to be displayed from among the image data in the image server based on the transmission image selection information indicating the image group managed by the image server S . Then the TV displays the images on the display unit S .

Furthermore according to the transmission image selection information indicating the image group managed by the image server and the utility form information the receiving user can use functions of for example reproducing the images as a slide show printing the images and downloading the images to a recording medium not shown attached to the TV or connected to the outside.

In addition for image printing the user can print the images by the printer on a LAN not shown and also ask via the internet a photograph print service provider to print the images.

As described above with the above configuration according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention the image group designation information is provided from the RF ID unit on the mailing object to the TV in the image receiving side. Therefore the receiving user does not need to input characters of a network access destination to obtain images for example. In other words the intuitive and simple operation of simply bringing the mailing object into proximity of the TV enables the receiving user to access the image data stored in the image server . As a result the receiving user can obtain images from the image server without knowledge of complicated operations such as menu selection and character inputs.

It should be noted that it has been described in the sixth embodiment that the mailing object is previously attached or incorporated with the RF ID unit . However the mailing object may be a general post card or letter paper attached with an independent RF ID unit that is provided separately. In this aspect the above effect can be produced by later attaching the RF ID unit to the mailing object. This produces further advantages that the sending user can use the sixth embodiment for any desired mailing object.

It should also be noted that if the access to the image server requires a login operation a server login ID and a server login password may also be written at Step S into the rewritable region of the memory unit in the RF ID unit on the mailing object . Here it is desirable that the login ID and the login password are not plane texts but are written in an encrypted format for security.

It should also be noted that it has been described in the sixth embodiment that the TV in the image transmission side performs selection of transmission images setting of the utility form information and writing of the image group designation information to the RF ID unit on the mailing object . However it is also possible that the image capturing device having a RF ID reader writer function performs setting of the transmission image selection information and the utility form information and writing of the image group designation information in order to produce the same effect as described above for obtaining images by the simple operation of the receiving user.

According to the variation of the sixth embodiment the mailing object UID is previously recorded on the memory unit of the RF ID unit on the mailing object . Here it is desirable to record the mailing object UID on a ROM region of the memory unit in order to reduce risks of data damages or data manipulation caused by accidental operations. illustrates a diagram of an example of a data structure of the memory unit .

The TV in the image transmission side sets the transmission image selection information and the utility form information into the above described RF ID unit in order to designate an image group in the image serve . In this situation the TV performs processing according to the flowchart of .

The TV reads information from the RF ID unit on the mailing object S and determines based on the medium identification information that the communication partner is a mailing object S . After that the TV obtains the mailing object UID S . The mailing object UID may be the information read at Step S or be newly obtained from the RF ID unit . Next the TV accesses the image server via the Internet S . The TV transmits the mailing object UID to the image server and thereby the image server associates with the transmitted mailing object UID with an address of the image group and then stores the manages information of the association association information S .

The TV obtains from the image server the server URL enabling the image receiving side to access the image server S . The obtained server URL is written into the rewritable region of the memory unit in the RF ID unit on the mailing object via the RF ID reader writer S .

As described above if the image server associates the image group with the mailing object UID and then stores and manages the association information the utility form information can be managed separately for each mailing object UID. Therefore in the situation where there are a plurality of the mailing objects it is possible to change an operation for receiving images for each mailing object namely for each different receiving user.

If in the configuration described in the sixth embodiment the image receiving side designates an image group for each mailing object generates a different image group address for each designated image group and writes the image group address into a corresponding RF ID unit the image transmission side needs complicated operations for designating image groups separately although the same advantages as those of the sixth embodiment can be obtained.

Therefore when the sending user selects the same transmission image group for a plurality of mailing objects it is preferable that the sending user records and manages different utility form information for each mailing object by using the mailing object UID as described earlier. Thereby it is possible to reduce operations of the sending user and to reduce a memory capacity of the image server because it is not necessary to hold pieces of the transmission image selection information separately thereby producing further advantages.

The processing of differs from the processing of in that Steps S and S are replaced by Steps S and . At Step the TV obtains an image group address in addition to the server URL. At Step S the TV writes the image group address together with the server URL into the memory unit of the RF ID unit .

Thereby when the image receiving side is to receive images the image receiving side accesses the designated image group in the image server . Here the access is permitted only when the mailing object UID of the image group stored and managed in the image server matches the mailing object UID used by the receiving server requesting the access. Thereby security is increased.

Conventionally if the user intends to show images on a large screen display device apparatus to a different user living in a remote location the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. However like the fourth embodiment the system according to the sixth embodiment enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation for example by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF ID into proximity of a display device. In the fourth embodiment generation of the post card with RF ID and writing of data into the RF ID is not performed by the user who captures and sends images or who views the images but by a service provider. In the sixth embodiment however the sending user in the image transmission side performs generation of the post card with RF ID and writing of data into the RF ID.

In the seventh embodiment of the present invention a method of changing setting for a device apparatus by using a RF ID card according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention is described.

The following describes a method of changing setting for a recorder by using a RF ID card with reference to .

A recorder records broadcast contents obtained by a tuner onto a Hard Disk Drive HDD or an optical disk drive . In addition the recorder reproduces on the TV the recorded contents or video audio contents ready by the optical disk drive .

An input signal processing unit includes an Analog Digital A D converter a decoder and an encoder in order to convert input video audio signals into data in a predetermined video audio format. The A D converter converts analog signals obtained by the tuner into digital signals. The decoder decodes scrambled contents. The encoder converts data into data in a video format according to MPEG 2 for example.

An output signal processing unit includes a Digital Analog D A converter and a decoder in order to provide video and audio to the TV . The D A converter converts digital signals to analog signals. The decoder decodes data in a data format according to MPEG 2 for example.

A system control unit controls operations of the recorder . The system control unit includes a setting information processing unit that switches setting for the recorder . The setting information processing unit will be described in detail later.

An operation input unit receives inputs from a user using buttons of a remote controller a front panel or the like not shown .

The HDD has an area in which recorded contents and content lists provided from the input signal processing unit are stored.

The optical disk drive is a disk drive that performs recording or reproducing for an optical disk such as a Digital Versatile Disc DVD or a Blue ray Disc. The optical disk drive records recorded contents and content lists provided from the input signal processing unit onto the optical disc and reproduces video audio contents in the optical disk.

The input signal processing unit the output signal processing unit the system control unit the HDD and the optical disk drive of the recorder are connected one another via a bus .

According to the setting information stored in the memory the setting information processing unit sets displaying of a menu screen a recording reproducing mode chapters of recorded contents TV program recommendation based on user s preference and the like regarding the recorder . In more detail the setting information processing unit reads an identifier indicating for example menu screen background color Black from the setting information and thereby issues a request for menu screen display to the output signal processing unit together with an instruction for displaying a background of a menu screen in black.

Here the setting information may be stored in an external storage unit such as a SD card not shown. Especially it is efficient to store in the HDD the setting information regarding chapters of recorded contents stored in the HDD information having a large size and the like.

Conventionally the setting information has been set prior to purchase of the recorder or set by operations of the user using the operation input unit . In the seventh embodiment of the present invention however the setting information can be changed based on information obtained from the RF ID reader writer .

The RF ID card includes a memory the antenna second antenna the power supply unit second power supply unit the data receiving unit the data transfer unit a processing unit the recording unit and the reproducing unit .

When the RF ID card is moved to bring the antenna into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the recorder the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the power supply unit via the antenna in order to provide power to the respective units in the RF ID card .

Information regarding data recording reproducing is read from the RF ID card to the recorder via the RF ID reader writer . In the recorder the information is received by the data receiving unit and then provided to the processing unit .

In the RF ID card the processing unit causes the recording unit to record information onto the memory and causes the reproducing unit to reproduce the information stored in the memory .

The data transfer unit transmits the information provided from the processing unit to the RF ID reader writer of the recorder via the antenna .

The memory in the RF ID card stores the UID the medium identification information and apparatus operation information .

The apparatus operation information holds pieces of information regarding an apparatus device to perform an operation using the RF ID card and regarding the operation. The following describes the pieces of information included in the apparatus operation information .

Operation apparatus identification information indicates a type of the apparatus device to perform the operation using the RF ID card . The operation apparatus identification information indicates the type by an identifier in the similar manner as described for the medium identification information . In the operation apparatus identification information holds an identifier indicating that a type of the apparatus to perform the operation is a recorder.

Target apparatus information holds information so that only a specific apparatus device can perform the operation using the RF ID card . In the example of the target apparatus information holds recorder ID for identifying the recorder . It should be noted that if an apparatus that can use the RF ID card according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention is limited for instance if only recorders can use the RF ID card the operation apparatus identification information and the target apparatus information may not be included in the apparatus operation information . In addition if the setting information processing unit in the recorder has a structure to change settings of the recorder by using the information in cards the medium identification information may not be included in the memory .

Operation instruction information indicates details of the operation to be performed by the apparatus designated in the apparatus operation information . In the example of the operation instruction information includes information indicating that setting is to be changed setting change information indicating a target for which the setting change is to be performed change target information and information indicating that communication is to be executed in obtaining the setting information communication execution .

It should be noted that the operation instruction information is not limited for a single operation but may include plural pieces of information for plural operations or may be a program in which the plural operations are combined.

Communication information is information regarding a server or the like. When the recorder is instructed based on the operation instruction information to access the server or the like to obtain data the recorder accesses the server or the like using the communication information . In the example of the communication information includes a URL login ID and a password of the server or the like. The URL may be replaced by an IP address. If the recorder is to access a different apparatus device via an office or home network the URL may be information for identifying the apparatus such as a MAC address.

The following describes processing by which the recorder registers the setting information from the recorder to a server by using the RF ID card with reference to .

At Step when the recorder receives an input from the user using the operation input unit the setting information processing unit causes the output signal processing unit to issue to the TV a request for message display. In response to the request the TV displays a message Please present a RF ID card on its screen at Step . The message may be displayed on a console not shown of the recorder . It is also possible that the recorder requests the user for authentication such as a password or biometric authentication when the user performs the input operation and after the authentication proceeds to the setting registration processing. It is further possible that the recorder does not request the TV for the message display but the user needs to present the RF ID card to the RF ID reader writer when using the recorder in order to perform steps of and after . It is still further possible that an enquiry message is displayed to enquire where the setting information is to be registered and the setting information is registered into the location the user designates. For example the setting information may be registered into the RF ID card or into a sever different from the server .

At Step the recorder detects the RF ID card. After that mutual authentication between the recorder and the RF ID card is performed at Step .

If the mutual authentication at Step is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing returns to Step to repeat the detection of the RF ID card.

At Step the recorder obtains the communication information from the memory in the RF ID card . If the memory in the RF ID card does not hold the communication information the recorder may issue to the user a request for providing the communication information. Moreover if the user instructs at Step the recorder to register the setting information into a location that is not designated in the RF ID card Step is not performed. If plural pieces of the communication information are stored in the RF ID card it is possible to display a list of the plural pieces of the communication information from which the user can select a desired one.

At Step the recorder gets the recorder ID and the setting information from the memory . The setting information is not limited to information currently stored but may be information inputted by the user in the setting registration processing.

At Step in the recorder the setting information processing unit issues to the communication unit a request for access to a server or the like having the URL included in the obtained communication information . The communication unit accesses the server using the login ID and the password .

At Step it is determined whether or not the access to the server is successful. If the access is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the setting registration processing is terminated.

At Step the recorder transmits to the server the UID and the recorder ID and the setting information which are obtained from the memory thereby registering the setting information into the server .

At Step the recorder generates the operation instruction information using a the operation designated at Step or a storage location of the setting information selected at Step b the setting information obtained at Step and c the communication information obtained at Step .

At Step the recorder performs the same step as Step to cause the TV to displays a message Please present a RF ID card on its screen.

At Step the recorder detects the RF ID card. After that mutual authentication between the recorder and the RF ID card is performed at Step .

If the mutual authentication at Step is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing returns to Step to repeat the detection of the RF ID card .

At Step it is determined whether or not the UID obtained at Step matches the UID obtained at Step . If the UIDs match then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing returns to Step to repeat the detection of the RF ID card .

At Step the recorder transmits to the RF ID card the operation apparatus identification information not shown in stored in the memory the recorder ID the operation instruction information generated at Step and the communication information in order to record register these pieces of information onto the memory of the RF ID card . As a result the setting registration processing is completed.

Referring to the setting information registered into the server by the above described processing of is described.

Each of the setting information registered in the server is hereinafter referred to as setting information . Each setting information is registered in association with a corresponding one of the UID and a corresponding one of the target apparatus information . In more detail the setting information holds an identifier indicating for example menu screen background color Black . In the example of a letter A or B at the end of pieces of the setting information indicates that the setting is different from another.

It is also possible that plural pieces of setting information are registered for a single UID such as UID in . It is further possible that a single piece of the target apparatus information such as REC is registered for plural pieces of setting information associated with different UID. Here the setting information may include the change target information .

Next referring to the apparatus operation information registered in the memory of the RF ID card by the above described processing of is described.

It is assumed in the example of that the UID designates UID and the medium identification information designates a card .

The apparatus operation information includes sets each including the operation apparatus identification information the target apparatus information the operation instruction information and the communication information . Here it is possible that the communication information is not registered as being information not related to the other pieces of information. For instance it is possible that only a piece of the communication information is registered to always access the same server in using the RF ID card .

The operation instruction information includes instruction detail information instruction target information and communication execution information . The instruction detail information holds an identifier indicating an operation to be performed by the device designated by the target apparatus information . The instruction target information holds an identifier indicating a setting such as a menu screen mode or recording mode of the apparatus to perform the operation such as REC . The communication execution information holds an identifier indicating whether or not communication is to be executed in performing the operation indicated in the instruction detail information . It should be noted that the apparatus operation information may include only the communication information if the operating to be performed using the RF ID card is limited to changing of setting.

The communication information holds a URL login ID a password and the like for accessing a server that is a partner of communication if the communication execution information indicates that the communication is to be executed.

Next the description is given for processing of changing the setting of the recorder by using the RF ID card with reference to . is a flowchart of processing by which the setting information processing unit in the recorder updates the setting information by using the RF ID card .

First at Step the recorder detects the RF ID card . After that at Step the recorder performs mutual authentication with the RF ID card .

As described above the use of the RF ID card enables the user to perform setting of the recorder without complicated operations. Even if the user is not familiar with operations of apparatuses devices the user can easily change the setting of the recorder by using the RF ID card . Moreover the operation executable for the recorder by using the RF ID card is not limited to the setting change. For example the instruction detail information can designate an operation of obtaining a list of recorded contents in the recorder. In this case the list is registered in the RF ID card or the server. Thereby the user can check the list on a different apparatus device other than the recorder by using the RF ID card. In addition the RF ID card holding information illustrated in the allows the user to perform timer recording in the recorder simply by presenting the RF ID card to the recorder. In more detail if the change target information associated with Index in is applied the recorder can perform timer recording according to setting of TV program ID and recording mode designated in the instruction target information simply by presenting the RF ID card to the recorder. Thereby the timer recording can be performed without accessing the server. In addition if the change target information associated with Index in is applied the recorder can perform timer recording according to TV program code designated in the instruction target information simply by presenting the RF ID card to the recorder. Here the recorder can obtain from the server a program ID or a start time and end time and b channel information. As a result the time recording can be performed according to the setting of the recording mode . Furthermore it is also possible that recommended TV program is designated in the instruction target information in the RF ID card. After presenting the RF ID card to the recorder the recorder obtains ID of the recommended TV program from the server. Thereby the recorder can obtain a content of the recommended TV program from the server and performs timer recording of the content. The above functions may be used as service for providing the RF ID card as being a supplement of a TV program guide magazine for example. This RF ID card can reduce user s bothersome procedures for timer recording. For another service it is also possible in the RF ID card that the instruction detail information designates a download operation the instruction target information designates video or software in a version where a function is restricted and the communication information designates a URL of a download website. Such RF ID cards are provided for free to users. The users can use the video or software as trial and purchase it if the user likes it.

It should be noted that the description in the seventh embodiment has been given for the recorder but the present invention is not limited to the recorder.

For example the seventh embodiment of the present invention may be implemented as a TV having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. The TV can register as the change target information a setting of an initial display channel or initial sound volume immediately after power on b setting of child lock for excluding adult broadcasts and violence scenes c setting of zapping for favorite channels d setting of contrast and brightness of a screen e setting of a language f setting of a continuous use time and the like simply by presenting the RF ID card to the TV. Thereby the TV can perform settings according to usability. Furthermore the seventh embodiment may be implemented also as a vehicle navigation system having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. In this aspect the instruction detail information designates highlighted display and the instruction target information designates landmark information . Thereby by using the RF ID card the vehicle navigation system can display the designated landmark as being highlighted by changing a character font character size or color. The landmark information may be obtained from a server. In this case the RF ID cards on which the apparatus operation information illustrated in is recorded are offered to users at rest areas or interchanges on expressways sightseeing spots and the like. Thereby the RF ID cards allow vehicle navigation systems of the users to display a recommended landmark where an even is currently held for example as highlighted display. In addition the seventh embodiment may be implemented as a laptop having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. The laptop can designate a setting of a resolution of a screen b setting of a position of an icon or the like on a display c setting of a wallpaper d setting of a screen saver e setting of start up of resident software f setting of employed peripheral devices g setting of a dominant hand for a mouse or the like and the like by simply by presenting the RF ID card to the laptop. Therefore if the user brings the RF ID card in a business trip the user can operate a different personal computer at the business trip location with the same settings as those the user usually uses. The seventh embodiment may be implemented further as a game machine having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. The user visiting a friend s house uses a RF ID card in which the instruction detail information designates setting change. By presenting the RF ID card to the game machine at the friend s house the user can change a setting of positions of keys on a remote controller and b setting of a structure of a menu screen. In addition the user can save data in the game machine by using the RF ID card. Moreover the following service using the RF ID card is also possible. The RF ID card holds the instruction detail information designating a download operation. Such RF ID cards are offered to users as supplements of magazines or the like. The users can use the RF ID cards to download an additional scenario a rare item or the like.

The RF ID card according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention can be also applied to home appliances connected to one another via a network. In this aspect the RF ID card previously holds a setting of a temperature of an air conditioner b setting for a temperature of hot water in a bus tab and the like depending of the user s preference. Thereby the user presents the RF ID card to RF ID reader writers in the user s house so as to manage settings of the home appliances at once. In addition the RF ID card may designate an operation for checking foods stored in a refrigerator. Here information of the foods which is registered in the refrigerator is obtained by using RF ID tags previously attached to the foods. Or video of the inside of the refrigerator is captured by using camcorder. Thereby the user can check a list of the foods on a TV by using a RF ID reader writer to obtain information from the RF ID card. As described above the RF ID card according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention can be applied for various usages. It is also possible to combine a RF ID cards for designating apparatuses such as four different cards indicating heating appliance cooling appliance stove and fan respectively and b RF ID cards for designating setting of the apparatuses such as three different cards indicating weak medium and strong respectively . It is further possible that such RF ID cards having the apparatus designating and setting designating functions are integrated into a single RF ID card. And the settings of the apparatuses can be customized.

Although only some exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above those skilled in the art will be readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention. Accordingly all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.

For example if two users hereinafter referred to as a user A and a user B exchanges photographs between them the user B can view photographs taken by the user A by the following method. The user B has a TV having an apparatus ID and a relay server having a URL. The apparatus ID and the URL are previously stored in a RF ID hereinafter referred to as a RF tag B . The user B generates information hereinafter referred to as device generation information B from the information in the RF tag B and stores the generated device generation information B into the RF tag B. The user B transmits the device generation information B to the user A via e mail or the like. The user A stores a URL of a server holding the photographs into the relay server in association with the received device generation information B. Thereby the user B simply presents the RF tab B to a RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to view the photographs taken by the user A. Here it is assumed that the RF tag B previously holds an e mail address of the user A. When the user B simply presents the RF tag B to the RF ID reader writer of the TV the device generation information B may be automatically written into the TV and a notification of the device generation information B may be automatically transmitted to the e mail address of the user A. Thereby even if the user B is not familiar with operations of the devices the user B can exchange photographs with the user A. Furthermore it is also possible that the user A encrypts at least one of a URL login ID and a password by using the device generation information B and sends to the user B a post card with RF ID on which the encrypted information is recorded. This makes it possible to restrict an apparatus permitted to display the photographs only to the TV of the user B. It is further possible that the user A sends to the user B a post card with two RF IDs that are a RF ID for sending and a RF ID for returning. In this aspect the user A records onto the RF ID for returning device generation information A that is previously generated by a TV or the like of the user A. This can restrict an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B. More specifically when the user B receives the post card with the two RF IDs and returns the post card to the user A the user B encrypts by using the device generation information A a URL a login ID or a password of a server storing the photographs of the user B and then records the encrypted data onto the RF ID for returning. Or when the user B stores the photographs the user B associates the photographs with the device generation information A. Therefore an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B can be restricted.

Moreover the mailing object UID of the RF ID on the mailing object may be a combination of a a group ID that is common among a plurality of mailing objects and b a UID unique that is unique to each mailing object. Thereby image data in the server is associated not with every mailing object UID but with the group ID. Therefore when post cards with RF ID on which the image data is associated with a plurality of targets are mailed it is possible to eliminate user s bothersome procedures for performing registration for each of the UIDs. It is also possible that the image data stored in the server in association with the group ID is switched to be permitted or inhibited to be viewed for each of the UID. Thereby if for example a printer prints destination addresses on the mailing objects the printer having a RF ID reader writer reads the UIDs on the mailing objects and thereby associates the UIDs with addresses in an address list respectively. Thereby the address list can be used to manage the permission inhibition of viewing the images stored in the server.

It is also possible that a post card or card is provided with a plurality of RF ID tags having various different functions. In this aspect the single post card or card can switch the functions by disconnecting communication of a part of the RF ID tags which are not currently used. For example a post card has a an upper portion on which a RF ID tag having a function of displaying a slide show of photographs is attached and b a lower portion on which a RF ID tag having a function of reproducing video. A user can switch the display function or the reproduction function by selecting the upper portion or the lower portion to be brought into proximity of a RF ID reader writer. The RF ID tags having different functions can be provided to a front side and a back side of the post card. It is also possible that covers made of a material blocking communications are applied on the RF ID tags so that the user can select a RF ID tag to be used by opening the cover on it.

It is further possible that photographs are stored in a plurality of servers and a RF ID tag holds URLs of the servers. Thereby a user can access the servers to obtain the photographs to display them in a list.

Moreover the RF ID reader writer may be provided not only to an apparatus device such as the TV or the recorder but also to the input means such as a remote controller for operating the apparatus. For instance if a plurality of apparatuses are connected to one another via a network an input means for collectively operating the apparatuses may be provided with a RF ID reader writer to operate the respective apparatuses. Furthermore an input means such as a remote controller may be provided with an individual authentication means for biometric authentication such as fingerprint authentication or face authentication password or the like. In this aspect the input means having a RF ID reader writer exchanges data with a RF ID tag only when the individual authentication is successful. It is also possible that the individual authentication information is previously stored in the RF ID tag and individual authentication is performed by the apparatus or the remote controller using the RF ID tag.

It should be noted that the definition of the term RF ID frequently used in the description of the present invention is not limited to narrow meaning. In general the term RF ID narrowly refers to a tag having a nonvolatile memory on which identification information is recorded . RF ID having a dual interface function or a security function seems commonly called as a IC card or the like. However in the embodiments of the present invention the RF ID widely refers to an electronic circuit which has a nonvolatile memory on which individual identification information is recorded and which can transmit the individual identification information to the outside via an antenna .

Conventionally if a user who is not familiar with operations of an apparatus device wishes to perform complicated settings for the apparatus it is necessary that a seller repairer or serviceperson of the apparatus visits a location of the apparatus to perform the settings or controls the apparatus remotely. Even in remotely controlling the apparatus the seller repairer or serviceperson has to visit the location for setting of the remote control. In the seventh embodiment of the present invention however the RF ID card enables the user to perform the settings of the apparatus the recorder without complicated operations. Therefore even the user not familiar with operations of the recorder can easily change the settings of the recorder.

The present invention can be implemented also as an image presentation method of presenting image related to a communication device on an apparatus device having a display screen in a communication system having a the apparatus having the display screen b a reader device connected to the apparatus via a communication path and c the communication device performing proximity wireless communication with the reader device. The present invention can be implemented further as a program stored in the communication device with identification information of the communication device the program being described by codes executed by a virtual machine included in a device performing proximity wireless communication with the communication device and being for executing accessing a server connected via a communication network downloading form the server image associated with the identification information from among image stored in the accessed server and displaying the downloaded image. In addition the present invention can be implemented as a computer readable recording medium such as a CD ROM on which the above program is recorded.

The communication device according to the present invention may be used of course as various devices having a RF ID unit in which identification information and a virtual machine program are stored. For example the communication device may be electronic devices such as a camera home appliances such as a rice cooker and a refrigerator and daily commodities such as a toothbrush.

Here an embodiment in which a RF ID reader is provided to a remote controller of a TV or the like is described with reference to diagrams a and b in a flowchart c in and a flowchart of .

First as described earlier a child device or child communicator such as a camera has the memory second memory and the antenna second antenna . When an antenna of a remote controller is moved into proximity of the antenna the antenna supplies power to the antenna . Thereby data in the memory is transmitted from the antenna to the antenna . The remote controller converts the received data into digital data by a communication circuit and then stores the digital data into a memory Step in . Then a transmission unit of the remote controller is faced to the TV and a transmission switch on the remote controller is pressed Step . Thereby the data in the memory is transmitted as light to a light receiving unit of the parent device apparatus the TV via a light emitting unit Step . The communication may be not light but wireless.

Referring back to a flowchart c in the embodiment of the present invention used in social systems should be applicable even in twenty or thirty years. An example of the program described in a virtual machine language or the like is known Java . However such programs are expected to be extended or replaced by totally different programs described in more efficient languages. In order to address the above situation in the embodiment of the present invention the parent device such as the TV holds parent device version information or parent device version information n that indicates a language type or version of a virtual machine language or the like Step in c of . In the beginning of the memory of the child device child device version information or child device version information n indicating a version of a program language or the like for the child device is recorded a in . Following to the child device version information a program region is recorded in the memory . The program region stores a program in a version a program in a version and a program in a version . Following to the program region a data region is recorded in the memory .

At Step in the flowchart of the parent device stores the parent device version information nof the parent device is stored. Then the parent device obtains the child device version information nfrom the memory of the child device Step . Then the parent device selects an execution program n having a maximum value of n n Step . The parent device executes the selected execution program Step . Then it is determined whether or not the parent device is connected to the Internet Step . If the parent device is connected to the Internet then the parent device is connected to the server via the Internet Step . The parent device thereby transmits language information which is set in the parent device to the server Step . The server provides the parent device with a program in the language indicated in the transmitted language information for example in French and causes the parent device to execute the program. Alternatively the server may execute the program on the server itself.

On the other hand if it is determined at Step that the parent device is not connected to the Internet then the processing proceeds to Step . At Step the parent device executes a local program in order to display on a screen of the parent device attribute information of the child device . The attribute information is for example information for notifying a trouble or information regarding the number of stored photographs. As described above the memory in the child device holds the child device version information . The memory stores a program procedure URL or the like of each generation. The program procedure URL or the like will be developed every 10 years. Such data format on which information is recorded for each generation can be kept being used even in twenty or thirty years in order to operate the parent device . a of illustrates an example of information on which versions or generations of a program are recorded. However the same advantages are also offered in another example illustrated in b of . In b of addresses of data stored in the server are recorded in associated with respective different versions. In this example a URL in a version a URL in a version and a URL in a version are recorded. The above can achieve backward compatibility for many years. For example it is assumed that a user purchases a product the parent device in version this year and the product has RF ID. Under the assumption it is expected that in twenty or thirty years programs described in virtual machine languages or the like such as Java which are compliant to versions and will be installed into the parent device . In the situation the child device can provide the parent device with the child device version information . Based on the child device version information the parent device can select a program to be compliant to an appropriate version. It is also expected that in thirty years the child device will hold information of programs in all versions and . Therefore a different parent device in version employs the best function of a version among them. On the other hand the former parent device in version employs a rather limited function of a version older than the version employed by the parent device in version . As a result perfect compatibility can be achieved.

The flowchart of is explained below. At Step pressing a read switch on the remote controller a user brings the remote controller into proximity of the antenna of the child device . Thereby data in the memory of the child device is transmitted to the memory of the remote controller . Next at Step facing the remote controller to the parent device such as a TV the user presses a transmission switch Step . Thereby the data in the memory is transmitted as light to the parent device Step . In the embodiment of the present invention the data is referred to as tag data for convenience. The parent device extracts or selects an execution program from the tag data Step . The parent device executes the extracted or selected execution program by a virtual machine language set in the parent device Step . The parent device reads Internet connection identification information for the parent device Step . At Step it is determined whether or not the identification information does not indicate Connectable to the Internet in other words it is determined based on the identification information whether or not the parent device is connectable to the Internet. If the identification information does not indicate Connectable to the Internet until Step then the parent device executes a non connectable state program in the execution program Step . The non connectable state program is to be executed when the parent device is not connectable to the Internet. Then the parent device displays a result of the execution on its screen Step . In the embodiment of the present invention the memory stores not only the information regarding connection to the Internet but also the non connectable state program to be executed when the parent device is not connectable to the Internet. Therefore the parent device can display a result of a minimum required operation when the parent device is not connectable to the Internet.

On the other hand if it is determined at Step that the identification information indicates Connectable to the Internet then the parent device executes a connection program Step . The connection program includes a part of the above execution program.

The connection program may be generated by adding into the execution program in the tag data data such as a URL of the server user ID and a password. More specifically the added such as a URL of the server user ID and a password are added in the data region illustrated in a of . Such connection program can extend the execution program in the tag data and also reduce a capacity of the nonvolatile memory in the memory . In this case it is also possible that the connection program in the memory is recorded onto a memory such as a non rewritable ROM in the program region while the URL of the server and the like are recorded onto the data region that is rewritable. As a result a tip area and a cost can be reduced.

At Step the parent device connects to a server having a specific URL. At Step it is determined whether or not the server requests the parent device to upload data to the server. If the server requests for uploading of data then at Step the parent device uploads data and or a program to the server. The server executes a program using the data Step . The server provides a result of the execution to the parent device Step . The parent device displays the result and the like of the execution on its screen Step .

On the other hand if it is determined at Step that the server does not request for uploading of data then the parent device downloads information including a specific program from the server having the URL Step . The parent device executes the downloaded program Step . Then the parent device displays the result of the execution on its screen S .

The memory in the RF ID unit or the child device has a limited capacity due to restriction on power consumption a volume or a cost. Therefore a common program cannot be stored in the memory. However the use of the connection program and the server as described in the embodiment of the present invention allows an infinitely large program to be executed.

A huge program may be executed on the server. Or such a program may be downloaded from the server to be executed. These aspects are in the scope of the present invention.

The embodiment described with reference to has been described to use a remote controller of a TV. In this example the remote controller has a battery buttons for switching TV channels an antenna for reading RF ID a communication circuit and an infrared light emitting unit. The remote controller can be replaced by a mobile phone to produce the same effects as described above. Since mobile phones generally have an infrared light emitting unit they are easily used instead of remote controllers. In addition mobile phones have a communication line. Therefore mobile phones can offer the same capability of that of remote controller being directly connected to the server. However a communication cost of a mobile phone is burden of a user. A display screen of a mobile phone is significantly smaller than that of a TV. Therefore a mobile phone may have the transmission switch as illustrated in . Thereby if there is a TV near the mobile phone the user faces the light emitting unit of the mobile phone to the TV to transmit tag data in the memory of the mobile phone directly to the TV. As a result the user can view data on a large screen of the TV having a high resolution. The above method does not incur a cost which is greatly advantageous for the user. The communication using the readout tag data via the mobile phone line is stopped in cooperation with the transmission switch.

In this case in the same manner as described for as the remote controller with reference to the mobile phone has at least a reader for RF ID or a Near Field Communication NFC unit. In the future mobile phones are expected to have a reader function for reading RF ID or the like. If RF ID readers are provided to mobile phones the present invention can be implemented with a much lower additional cost which is greatly advantageous for the user. Moreover the present invention can be easily implemented not only as a remote controller or a mobile phone but also as a Personal Digital Assistance PDA terminal a laptop or a mobile media player.

The following describes the eighth embodiment according to the present invention with reference to the drawings.

The eighth embodiment describes an aspect different from the aspects described in the first to seventh embodiments. However the eighth embodiment is a system having the basically same configuration as described in the first to seventh embodiments including a terminal device such as the image capturing device which has a RF ID tag a communication device such as the TV which has a RF ID reader writer and a server such as the server which is connected to the communication device via a general purpose network to communicate with the communication device.

In the eighth embodiment for example a TV remote controller or mobile phone terminal hereinafter referred to also as a communication device which has a RF ID reader writer is moved to touch an external device having RF ID. Thereby the communication device reads information including ID and the like regarding the external device hereinafter referred to as external device information from the external device. Then the communication device pairs the external device information with information regarding the communication device itself hereinafter referred to as communication device information and transfers the paired information to a server. As a result it is possible to register into a database in the server the external device information in association with the communication device information. The above configuration is useful when a user of the external device wishes to perform user registration of the external device by a single operation using the communication device such as a mobile terminal. For example it is assumed that the external device information is a product serial number warranty number of the external device and that the communication device information is an e mail address registered in the communication device. Under the assumption a single operation of the communication device can read the product serial number of the external device and then register to the database in the server the product serial number in association with the e mail address registered in the communication device. This can simplify user registration of the external device.

Conventionally operations for registering an e mail address a product serial number and the like into a server are performed by a user. The complicated operations inhibit increase of the external devices with user registration. A method described in the eighth embodiment however enables a user of the external device to complete user registration by a single operation. Therefore even if the user is not familiar with Information Technology IT devices the user can easily speedily and intuitively perform the user registration. As a result the registered devices are expected to be increased.

Examples of the external device according to the eighth embodiment are the terminal device such as the image capturing device described in the first to seventh embodiments and also home appliances including a microwave a washing machine and a refrigerator and audio visual AV home appliances apparatuses such as a TV and a recorder. The external device may be a book or a food for instance. Basically the external device may be anything that can communicate with a reader writer using a passive active RF ID or Near Field Communication NFC unit.

Examples of the communication device according to the eighth embodiment are the communication device such as the TV described in the first to seventh embodiments and also a mobile phone terminal and a mobile device. The communication device may be anything having a reader writer which can communicate with the RF ID or NFC unit of the external device . Desirably the communication device is portable.

An example of the server according to the eighth embodiment is a server connected to the communication device via a general purpose network in the same manner as described for the server according to the first to seventh embodiments. The server according to the eighth embodiment includes at least a database . The server has a function of registering data into the database based on information registration information transmitted from the communication device .

For the convenience of the explanation it is assumed in the following example that the external device the communication device and the server are connected in the system. However each of the external device the communication device and the server has specific characteristics in its structure and the system connecting them has also characteristics.

Referring to the external device includes a CPU the second memory a first encryption unit a modulation demodulation unit a power induction unit having the same function as that of the second power supply unit and an antenna for proximity wireless communication.

The CPU is a system control unit of the external device . The CPU is supplied with power from the power induction unit a battery not shown or other power source.

The second memory has the same structure as that of the second memory described in the first to seventh embodiments. Therefore the identical elements in the second memory are assigned with the same numeral references and will not be explained again below. The second memory according to the eighth embodiment holds at least UID product serial number or the like of the external device for identifying the external device . If the external device has a function of accumulating use histories of the external device or a function of detecting a trouble for example the second memory holds information of the use histories of the external device or error codes defining troubles. The information or code corresponds to the captured image state information in the image capturing device according to the first to seventh embodiment. Therefore the second memory according to the eighth embodiment holds all pieces of information such as the server specific information for specifying the server which are recorded in the second memory illustrated in .

The first encryption unit encrypts information detailed data in the second memory to prevent tapping and manipulation of the information along a transmission path when the information is to be transmitted to the communication device using proximity wireless communication. The encryption is performed using a first cryptography key. The first cryptography key may be a public key or a private key.

The modulation demodulation unit performs modulation and demodulation when the external device performs proximity wireless communication with the communication device . When the information in the second memory which is encrypted using the first cryptography key is to be transmitted to the communication device the modulation demodulation unit modulates the information to be outputted. On the other hand when information is received from the communication device the modulation demodulation unit demodulates the received information.

The power induction unit induces power from radio waves using electromagnetic induction to perform proximity wireless communication with the communication device . The power induction unit may supply power generated using the electromagnetic induction to other units included in the external device .

The antenna is a loop antenna for the proximity wireless communication. In the eighth embodiment it is assumed in proximity wireless communication that the RF ID or NFC unit operates at a High Frequency HF of 15.56 MHz. However the frequency band is not limited to the above. The frequency band may be an Ultra High Frequency UHF ranging from 900 Mz to 1 GHz or may exceed 2 GHz.

Here the eighth embodiment aims at a simple operation for user registration of the external device . Therefore the second memory needs to hold UID for identifying each external device . It is desirable that the second memory further holds information for specifying a manufacturer of the external device information for specifying a manufacturing date information for specifying manufacture processes factory line lot person in charge of manufacturing and the like. It is further desirable that the second memory holds the server specific information allowing the communication device to easily access a specific server of each manufacturer of the external device . Thereby the communication device can be connected to the specific server of its manufacturer that differs for each external device without any complicated operations. As a result a cost of the communication device can be reduced.

Next a structure of the communication device is explained. Referring again to the communication device according to the eighth embodiment includes a CPU an antenna a modulation demodulation unit proximity wireless communication unit an output switch unit a modulation demodulation switch unit a registration information generation unit a device information storage unit an input unit a key an external device information memory a second encryption unit an access control information generation unit a server information storage unit a server communication unit an Internet Protocol IP communication information storage unit and a display unit .

The CPU is a system controller of the communication device . The CPU manages operations of each unit included in the communication device .

The antenna corresponds to the antenna unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The antenna serves as a partner of the antenna in the external device . The antenna communicates with the external device using proximity wireless communication.

The modulation demodulation unit corresponds to the proximity wireless communication unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The modulation demodulation unit performs modulation and demodulation for a proximity wireless communication path connected to the external device . The modulation demodulation unit demodulates information the external device information for example provided from the external device and modulates information to be transmitted to the external device . The modulation method or demodulation method is compatible with various methods such as a high speed high output method and a low speed low output method. This has been already described in detail in the first embodiment and therefore will not be described again below.

The output switch unit is one of the characteristic units in the eighth embodiment. The output switch unit is included in the antenna unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The output switch unit switches an output power of radio wave signals to be transmitted from the antenna . When for example the communication device is far from the external device so that stable communication is impossible between them the output switch unit selects high output high powered signals. On the other hand when the communication device is near the external device the output switch unit selects low output low powered signals to prevent that the output signals transmitted from the antenna interfere with signals transmitted from other devices.

The switch of output power is desirably performed according to a request from the external device . In this aspect the external device is provided with for example a communication radio wave strength measurement unit which detects a voltage value of inducted power or a size of output power of communication radio waves and thereby causes the external device to transmit an output switch command to the communication device . Based on the command the output switch unit in the communication device changes a strength of output signals transmitted from the antenna . Here the information indicating a power level of power inducted by the external device such as the voltage value of inducted power or the size of output power of communication radio waves may be included in the external device information to be transmitted.

The modulation demodulation switch unit is included in the proximity wireless communication unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The modulation demodulation switch unit switches a modulation method between a high speed modulation method and a low speed modulation method. Thereby when the communication device is far from the external device so that communication quality is not good the modulation demodulation switch unit selects a low speed modulation method to assure communication reliability. Here the switch of speed in modulation demodulation is desirably performed according to a request from the external device . In this aspect the external device is provided with for example a communication radio wave strength measurement unit which detects a voltage value of inducted power or a size of output power of communication radio waves and thereby causes the external device to transmit a modulation demodulation switch command to the communication device . Based on the command the modulation demodulation switch unit in the communication device changes a modulation method for a communication path for proximity wireless communication with the external device . Here the information indicating a power level of power inducted by the external device such as the voltage value of inducted power and the size of output power of communication radio waves may be included in the external device information to be transmitted. The switch of modulation methods has already been described in the first embodiment in detail and therefore will not be described again below.

An external device ID storage unit included in the communication device stores external device ID for identifying each external device . The external device ID is obtained by proximity wireless communication with the external device . The external device ID storage unit holds information of output power of communication radio waves and a modulation method for each external device ID. Thereby only the external device ID which has a small data amount is securely read out at low speed and high output. On the other hand reading of the information of use histories of regarding the external device hereinafter referred to as use history information is controlled according to stored data in the external device ID storage unit to determine whether or not the use history information can be read at high speed and low output. As a result it is possible to control the switch of output power of radio waves and the switch of modulation methods for access to each external device .

In the eighth embodiment the external device may be any various devices as described earlier. The communication device cannot access all kinds of external devices using the same reading method because the external devices have RF ID units on respective different positions. It is bothersome to adjust output power and a modulation method for each access. Therefore in the eighth embodiment the communication device is provided with the external device ID storage unit for recording status histories of communication with each external device . The recorded histories are used to achieve high speed proximity wireless communication on the whole without adjustment for each access. In short the output switch unit and the modulation demodulation switch unit perform their switching processes according to data stored in the external device ID storage unit thereby achieving high speed proximity wireless communication on the whole. The external device ID storage unit may be physically included in the device information storage unit . If so a partial area of the device information storage unit is dedicated to the external device ID storage unit .

The registration information generation unit corresponds to the registration information generation unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The registration information generation unit generates information registration information to be transmitted to the server by adding the communication device information regarding the communication device itself which is stored in the device information storage unit to the external device information provided from the external device . The communication device information added to the external device information is stored in the device information storage unit . The communication device information includes communication device identification information and user information .

The communication device identification information is identification information for uniquely identifying the communication device . The communication device identification information is different from a MAC address and an IP address used in communication control. If the communication device is a mobile phone terminal the communication device identification information is for example identification information for identifying a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card or identification information registered for each RF ID reader writer control application installed in the mobile telephone terminal. Or the communication device identification information may be a product serial number or a serial number of the communication device . The user information is information for identifying a user of the communication device . The user information includes for example a telephone number an electronic mail e mail address user identification information and a post code or an address of course .

The input unit is used to register the communication device information into the device information storage unit using the key . A slot for a SIM card inserted to a mobile phone terminal is also the input unit .

The external device information memory is a memory that temporarily stores the external device information provided from the external device by the proximity wireless communication. The external device information memory which serves as a work memory for the registration information generation unit adds the communication device information to the stored external device information to generate transmission information to be transmitted to the server .

Here it is preferable that the registration information generation unit generates the registration information in which the communication device information is indicated as parent primary stem information and the external device information is indicated as child secondary branch information. If the communication device information is registered as parent information and the external device is registered as child information in the database in the server as described later loads on the server can be reduced.

The second encryption unit encrypts the transmission information registration information that is generated by the registration information generation unit to be transmitted to the server . A cryptography key used in the second encryption unit is a second cryptography key different from the first cryptography key used in the first encryption unit of the external device .

The following describes advantages of employing both the first encryption unit in the external device and the second encryption unit in the communication device .

The encryption by the first encryption unit has two purposes. For the first purpose the encryption by the first encryption unit prevents tapping and manipulation of the external device information transmitted from the external device in proximity wireless communication between the external device and the communication device . For the second purpose the encryption by the first encryption unit prevents that the external device information itself transmitted from the external device is inspected by the communication device . For example in the situation where a communication device manufactured by a B company reads external device information of an external device manufactured by an A company there is a risk that the communication device manufactured by the B company which is a competitor of the A company reads and analyzes use history information of the external device manufactured by A company. Therefore if the external device information regarding the external device manufactured by the A company is encrypted in the external device it is possible to reduce the risk that the communication device manufactured by the B company reads the external device information.

On the other hand the encryption by the second encryption unit has a purpose of preventing tapping and manipulation of the transmission information registration information in communication with the server . In the configuration according to the eighth embodiment the external device information transmitted to the server has been applied with double encryption processes of the first encryption in the external device and the second encryption in the communication device . The second cryptography key may be a private key generated depending on a result of authentication with the server or a public key.

The access control information generation unit corresponds to the access control information generation unit according to the aspect of the present invention. The access control information generation unit generates access control information used when the communication device accesses the server . The access control information is a so called Uniform Resource Identifier URI generated by adding definition of a communication protocol or the server specific information stored in the server information storage unit to the transmission information registration information generated by the registration information generation unit .

Here the server specific information stored in the server information storage unit includes a server name a sever address and a login account and a login password for login to the server . Thereby the access control information that is a so called URI is generated in a form of a transmission command to be transmitted to the server .

The server communication unit transmits the access control information generated by the access control information generation unit to the server via the Internet on a packet by packet basis. In general communication via the Internet needs IP communication. Therefore the server communication unit automatically adds an IP address and a MAC address of the communication device which are stored in the IP communication information storage unit to the access control information on a packet by packet basis to be transmitted.

The communication device identification information added to the external device information by the registration information generation unit is clearly different from the IP address and the MAC address stored in the IP communication information storage unit . The MAC address is information for uniquely identifying the communication device in communication control. Therefore the MAC address is information for identifying the device within the Internet communication network. The communication device identification information however is information registered to specify product attributes of the communication device such as a manufacturer and a product type of the communication device . Moreover while the IP address and the MAC address are added for each transmission packet to the server for communication control the communication device identification information is one of the registration information to be registered into the database of the server . In addition the MAC address of the communication device is replaced by a MAC address of a router when the packet passes the router before arriving at the server . Therefore the MAC address of the communication device has already been deleted when the packet arrives at the server . The IP address also has a possibility of being changed by a personal computer or the like. Therefore the IP address is not information for always identifying the communication device .

Furthermore the communication device identification information is added to each transmission information registration information generated by the registration information generation unit to be transmitted to the server while the IP address and the MAC address are added to each communication packet in the communication path to the server . Moreover the communication device identification information is applied with the second encryption as the transmission information registration information generated by the registration information generation unit . However the IP address and the MAC address added to each packet are not encrypted. The IP address would be encrypted when communication with the server is performed using Security Architecture for Internet Protocol IPsec . However this encryption is different from the second encryption for encrypting the transmission information registration information generated by the registration information generation unit . The encryption of IPsec is performed for each IP packet.

Next the server according to the eighth embodiment is descried. The server according to the eighth embodiment includes a communication unit a second decryption unit a first decryption unit a database registration unit the database a display detail selection unit and a WEB server .

The communication unit is connected to the communication device via the Internet to communicate with the communication device . Thereby the communication unit performs IP communication with the communication device .

The second decryption unit serves as a partner of the second encryption unit in the communication device . The second decryption unit decrypts the transmission information registration information encrypted by the second encryption unit of the communication device . The second decryption unit thereby extracts the communication device identification information and the user information added by the communication device and the external device information encrypted by the external device .

The first decryption unit decrypts the encrypted external device information that is obtained by the decryption of the second decryption unit . The first decryption unit thereby extracts the external device information.

As described above the external device information is encrypted in the external device and transmitted to the communication device . Next the external device information is further encrypted by the communication device and transmitted to the server . Then the external device information received by the server is decrypted in the server . Therefore the external device information is not inspected by the communication device . This produces advantages when the external device and the communication device are manufactured by different manufacturers which has already been described earlier and therefore will note be described again here.

The database registration unit registers stores the decrypted communication device information and external device information into the database . The communication device information includes the communication device identification information and the user information . The external device information includes the external device identification information such as a manufacturer and a product serial number for specifying a product type of the external device the use history information of the external device trouble history information and failure codes.

The database registration unit registers the communication device information as parent stem information and the external device information as child branch leaf information according to the registration information in which the communication device information is indicated as parent primary stem information and the external device information is indicated as child secondary branch information. Therefore the database can manage the communication device information as parent stem information and the external device information as child branch leaf information.

For example since the communication device information includes the user information and the like the communication device information can offer the same effect as that produced by the user registration of the external device . More specifically while a user of the external device conventionally needs to perform user registration requiring complicated processes such as entry of user information a product serial number and the like the configuration according to the eighth embodiment enables the user to perform the user registration simply by presenting the communication device to the external device .

In addition the configuration according to the eighth embodiment allows a manufacturer of the external device to examine information associated with the communication device in order to determine which user possesses which product. As a result a traceability of products can be improved.

The display detail selection unit selects from the WEB server detail to be displayed on the display unit of the communication device . More specifically the display detail selection unit selects data to be displayed on the communication device depending on the external device information decrypted by the first decryption unit . Thereby the external device information allows the communication device to display a website depending on each external device .

For example if the external device is a washing machine a website of the washing machine which includes an instruction manual of the washing machine is displayed. When if the external device is a microwave a website of the microwave is displayed.

The external device information decrypted in the first decryption unit includes for example failure codes regarding the external device . The display detail selection unit can select display detail based on a failure code. Therefore the display detail selection unit can cause the communication device to display a website describing how to deal with failures of the external device information.

Combination of the display detail selection unit and the database can transmit to the communication device a notification of a product having a possibility of causing serious accidents. For example it is assumed that it is found that a microwave A as the external device has a possibility of causing serious accidents. The microwave A has already been touched by the communication device hereinafter referred to as a communication device A to register information of the microwave A to the server in other words to perform user registration . This means that the information of the microwave A is already registered in the database in association with the communication device A. Under the assumption a user of the communication device A purchases a washing machine B as a new external device and touches the washing machine B by the communication device A. Thereby the information of the washing machine B is newly registered in the database of the server in association with the communication device A. This allows the server to notice that the communication device A is associated with the microwave A having a possibility of accidents. Therefore the display detail selection unit transmits a registration screen for registering the information of the washing machine B together with a notification for asking to stop use of the microwave A. As a result the possibility of serious accidents can be significantly reduced.

The management as illustrated in shows that a possessor of the communication device possesses the external devices to and a possessor of the communication device possesses the external devices to .

Thus the eighth embodiment is characterized in managing at least information of an external device in association with a communication device without registering private information. For example if a telephone number an e mail address and the like are previously registered in the communication device such as a mobile phone it is possible to manage information of the external device in association with the private information registered in the communication device . In any cases the simple operation of touching the external device by the communication device allows a system to perform user registration or the like.

Referring to the URI as the access control information includes a protocol name http and a sever address or server name followed by the communication device information and the external device information. Here the communication device information is applied with the second encryption and the external device information is applied with the first and second encryption.

As described above the user of the external device can perform user registration regarding the external device by the simple operation of a single touching process using the communication device . The system according to the eighth embodiment enables even the external device that cannot possess an Internet communication function to perform registration of its external device information including ID such as user registration by relaying the information by the communication device connectable to the Internet. Conventionally the user registration requires complicated operations in which a user should enter data by hands to a personal computer or mobile phone connectable to the Internet. The eighth embodiment can simplify the complicated operations. In the eighth embodiment the external device does not need to have an expensive Internet connection device. Instead the external device is provided with a module for proximity wireless communication such as a RF ID unit which is implemented at a significantly low cost.

As described above according to the eighth embodiment the system configuration connecting the external device the communication device and the server can simplify user registration regarding the external device . As described earlier each of the external device the communication device and the server has a characteristic structure.

Although the eighth embodiment has been described in detail above for the communication device according to the present invention those skilled in the art will be readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the embodiment without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention. Accordingly all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention.

The following describes the ninth embodiment. illustrates environments of home networks assumed in the ninth embodiment. A home network is established in each of houses M M and M. Each of the home networks is connected to a registration server M via the Internet M.

If services provided via a home network are limited within a corresponding house the registration server M may exist in the house. It is also possible that a home network is divided into various places such as a vacation house and an office and that a plurality of home networks are used in a single house such as a dormitory or a room sharing house.

It is assumed that in a house there are home appliances which are always connected to the Internet M hereinafter referred to as always connected home appliances and home appliances which are not always connected to the Internet M hereinafter referred to as non always connected home appliances . The always connected home appliances such as TVs M and M a DVD recorder M and the like are connected to the Internet M via a router M or a wireless Access Point AP M. The non always connected home appliances such as a digital camera M a microwave M and a refrigerator M are indirectly connected to the Internet M as needed. In the ninth embodiment a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone M is also a terminal included in the home network.

The devices in the ninth embodiment can perform simple data communication with other device each other by using a proximity wireless communication device. Each of the devices obtains information of other device using the proximity wireless communication device and registers the obtained information into the registration server M using a home network device.

One of them is a proximity wireless communication device M. The proximity wireless communication device M is generally a so called NFC or RF tag.

The other device is a home network communication device M. Examples of the home network communication device M are a wireless communication device using wireless Local Area Network LAN or ZigBee which is used in connecting home appliances to each other a wired communication device using Ethernet or Poser Line Communication PLC and a communication device using WiMax or Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP which is used in mobile phones.

The communication device M also includes a user interface IF device M. The user IF device is for example an input device such as buttons a display and an output device using a Light Emitting Diode LED or the like. For devices such as TVs and air conditioners data input output is generally performed by using a remote controller that is physically separated from the device. For convenience of the description such a remote controller is also considered as the user IF device M in the ninth embodiment of the present invention.

A device UID obtainment unit M in the communication device M obtains information including device UID for identifying a registration device M that is a device to be registered by using the proximity wireless communication device M.

Here the registration device M transmits a registration command and registration information including device UID of the registration device M to the communication device M by using the proximity wireless communication device M.

A registration information generation unit M obtains the registration information including the device UID from the device UID obtainment unit M and obtains home ID from a home ID management unit M. Then the registration information generation unit M adds the home ID to the registration information obtained from the registration device M via the device UID obtainment unit M to generate information added registration information. If position information of the registration device M or the like is to be added to the registration information the registration information generation unit M obtains the position information from a position information obtainment unit M.

Examples of the position information are address information based on a post code inputted to a TV geographical position information generated by a Global Positioning System GPS of a mobile phone and the like. If position information of the registration device M is registered the registered position information can be used to easily provide services to improve home appliance traceability or the like.

The registration information generation unit M transmits the registration information added with the home ID to the registration information transmitting receiving unit M.

The home ID management unit M manages home ID that is different from communication device ID used by the communication device included in the above described home network.

In conventional home networks a master device of each communication device manages information for the communication device. The management method is different depending on a type of the corresponding communication device. Therefore it is not possible to manage information on home by home basis. Although there is a situation where ID is inputted by a user for each service this results in quite low usability.

In the ninth embodiment introduction of new different ID that is home ID makes it possible to manage pieces of information of devices included in a home network without using a communication device or services.

When the home ID management unit M registers information of a device to the server at the first time the home ID management unit generates home ID. The home ID may be generated based on position information or UID of the communication device. It is also possible to generate home ID based on a random number to check whether or not the generated home ID does not overlap with any other ID in the registration server. It is further possible that a user sets the home ID.

When a registration information transmitting receiving unit M in the communication device M receives registration information from the registration information generation unit M the registration information transmitting receiving unit M transmits the received registration information to the registration server M using the home network communication device M.

The registration server M compares the received registration information to pieces of information stored in the registration database M to determine whether or not the received registration information can be registered. Then the registration server M sends a registration response back to the communication device M.

In receiving the registration response the registration information transmitting receiving unit M notifies the user of a result of the determination by using the user IF device M. If the registration server M determines that the received registration information cannot be registered the registration information transmitting receiving unit notifies the determination to the registration information generation unit M in order to request change of the registration information. Thereby it is possible to collectively manage devices in a home network including white goods that do not have user IF devices for communication.

The communication device M receives the registration command and the device UID from the registration device M by using the device UID obtainment unit M M .

After receiving the registration command and the device UID the communication device M determines whether or not the communication device M has home ID M . If the communication device M does not have the home ID NO at M then the communication device M obtains home ID the processing is referred to as home ID obtainment M . On the other hand if the communication device M has the home ID YES at M the communication device M generates information of the communication device to be registered into the communication device M itself hereinafter referred to as registration information or home ID M .

Next the communication device M transmits the registration information to the registration server M by using the registration information transmitting receiving unit M M .

The communication device M determines whether or not the communication device M receives a response registration response to the transmitted registration information from the registration server M M . If the response is not received then the communication device M presents a user with a registration failure notification for notifying a failure of the registration processing M and terminates the registration processing. On the other hand if the communication device M receives the response then the communication device M presents the user with an inquiry asking whether or not to register the generated information into the communication device M M . If the user replies OK then the communication device M completes the registration processing. If the user replies NO the communication device M returns to the home ID obtainment. When it is difficult to obtain home ID the registration processing is terminated as a failure.

The communication device M determines whether or not the communication device M has a function of automatically generating home ID hereinafter referred to also as an automatic generation function M . If the communication device M has the function then the communication device M automatically generates the home ID. On the other hand if the communication device M does not have the function the communication device M asks the user to manually input the home ID. If there is no method for manually inputting home ID or the user refuses to the manual input then the communication device M notifies the user of a failure of the registration processing M to persuade the user to obtain the home ID by any different method. When the communication device M automatically generates home ID the communication device M selects an appropriate automatic generation function M . If the communication device M can obtain geographical position information by a GPS or the communication device M is a terminal such as a TV for which an address as position information has been generally registered the communication device M generates the home ID using the position information M . If the communication device M is a terminal generally set in a house the communication device M generates the home ID using a unique identifier of the communication device M M . Especially if it is difficult to generate effective home ID the communication device M generates the home ID using a random number M . After generating the home ID the communication device M transmits the home ID to the server M . Then the communication device M receives information regarding the generated home ID from the server and thereby determines whether or not the home ID can be used M . If it is determined that the home ID cannot be used then the communication device M returns to the processing of generating the home ID. On the other hand if the home ID can be used then the communication device M asks the user whether to not to register the generated home ID into the communication device M itself M . If the user replies OK then the communication device M registers the home ID into the communication device M itself M . Otherwise the communication device M returns to the processing of generating the home ID.

The registration device M transfers a registration command and information including device UID for identifying the registration device M to the communication device M via the proximity wireless communication device. If the communication device M does not have home ID the communication device M generates provisional home ID and transmits the generated provisional home ID to the registration server M via the home network communication device. The registration server M sends a response with information regarding the provisional home ID to the communication device M. On the other hand if the communication device M has home ID or if the communication device M receives from the registration server M home ID that is allowed by the registration server M to be used the communication device M transmits the home ID and the registration information including the device UID to the registration server M thereby completing the registration of information of the registration device M.

In the tenth embodiment of the present invention a configuration in which the home ID is shared among communication terminals communication devices is described.

Communication devices MS and MR included in a home network share the same home ID using a home network M and the home network communication devices M. The communication devices MS and MR may share the home ID using the proximity wireless communication devices M.

The communication device according to the tenth embodiment hereinafter referred to as a transmitting communication device MS can share the home ID with another communication device hereinafter referred to as a receiving communication device MR in the same house by transferring a sharing command and home ID to the receiving communication device via the proximity wireless communication devices M.

In the transmitting communication device MS a home ID sharing unit MS in a home ID management unit MS provides the sharing command and the home ID that is held in a home ID storage unit MS to a proximity wireless communication device MS.

For example when the proximity wireless communication device MS of the transmitting communication device MS is moved into proximity of a proximity wireless communication device MR of the receiving communication device MR information is transferred between them.

Thereby the home ID in the transmitting communication device MS is stored into the proximity wireless communication device MR of the receiving communication device MR.

If a home ID storage unit MR in the receiving communication device M does not hold any home ID a home ID sharing unit MR in the receiving communication device MR stores the received home ID into the receiving communication device MR itself. Thereby it is possible to quite easily share the home ID between the communication devices. On the other hand if the home ID storage unit MR already holds home ID the receiving communication device MR transmits both the held home ID and the received home ID to the registration server M. In receiving both home IDs the registration server M manages both home IDs virtually as a single home ID. The registration server M may notify both communication devices of one of the home IDs to unify them. Even in this case the registration server M manages both home IDs virtually as a single home ID since there are non always connected devices in the home network. It is possible that ID of a non always connected device is updated every time of being connected to the home network and the virtual management by the registration server M ends when updating of all of the registration devices namely devices to be registered which are included in the home network are completed. Thereby it is possible to unify originally plural home networks into a single network.

The home ID sharing can be performed by using the home network. When a communication device is to be connected to the home network M and a home network connection detection unit MS of the communication device detects that the communication device does not hold home ID the communication device broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals connected to the home network M. Terminals holding home ID among the terminals connected to the home network M transmit the home ID to the communication device. Thereby the home ID sharing is completed prior to start of communication. Here if a master terminal to respond to requests for home ID sharing is previously selected from among terminals holding the home ID it is possible to prevent that a device requesting home ID sharing receives responses from a plurality of terminals thereby overburdening the home network. If there is no response the communication device terminal requesting home ID sharing may obtain home ID by itself.

When the receiving communication device MR receives a sharing command and home ID M the receiving communication device MR determines whether or not the receiving communication device MR holds home ID M . If the receiving communication device MR does not hold home ID then the receiving communication device MR registers the received home ID as home ID into the receiving communication device MR itself M . On the other hand if the receiving communication device MR holds home ID the receiving communication device MR compares the held home ID to the received home ID. If the held home ID is identical to the received home ID the receiving communication device MR terminates the processing without any further processes. On the other hand if the held home ID is not identical to the received home ID the receiving communication device MR selects home ID M . The selection of home ID may be performed by the receiving communication device MR or the registration server. In the situation where the receiving communication device MR asks the registration server to perform the selection the receiving communication device MR transmits the held home ID and the received home ID to the registration server as sharing information M . Thereby the receiving communication device MR receives from the registration server a sharing response including home ID selected by the registration server M . Then the communication device MR inquiries the user whether or not to share register the selected ID into the communication device MR M . If the user replies OK the registration processing is completed. It the user replies NO the received ID receiving communication device MR returns to the processing for selecting home ID. In the case where the receiving communication device MR itself selects the held home ID the receiving communication device MR transmits the held home ID as home ID and the received home ID as sharing home ID to the registration server M . The registration server notifies updating of the home ID to other communication devices already sharing home ID. In the situation where the receiving communication device MR selects the received home ID then the receiving communication device MR updates the held home ID by the received home ID M . In addition the receiving communication device MR transmits the previously held home ID as sharing home ID and the received home ID as home ID to the registration server M . The registration server notifies updating of the home ID to other communication devices already sharing home ID.

After transmitting a sharing command and home ID to the registration server the transmitting communication device MS determines whether or not a response to the home ID sharing is received from the registration server M . If there is no response the transmitting communication device MS terminates the processing. On the other hand if the response including a notification of updating home ID is received the transmitting communication device MS updates the home ID by the notified home ID M and completes the processing.

The transmitting communication device MS transmits home ID A to the receiving communication device MR by using the proximity wireless communication device. The receiving communication device MR transmits home ID B that is held in the receiving communication device MR itself and the received home ID A to the registration server M. The registration server selects the home ID B from the received home IDs and notifies the home ID B to a communication device holding the home ID A and the receiving communication device MR to cause the devices to register the home ID B.

The transmitting communication device MS detects connection to the home network M and broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals in the home network M . If a response to the request for home ID sharing is received the transmitting communication device MS registers home ID received with the response into the transmitting communication device MS itself M . On the other hand if the response is not received the transmitting communication device MS performs the home ID obtainment M .

After receiving the request for home ID sharing M the receiving communication device MR determines whether or not the receiving communication device MR itself is a master terminal selected in the home network M . If the receiving communication device MR is the master terminal then the receiving communication device MR transmits home ID held in the receiving communication device MR itself in response to the request M . On the other hand if the receiving communication device MR is not the master terminal then the receiving communication device MR does not perform any processes. Here if a master terminal is not selected from terminals holding home ID the receiving communication device MR responds to all requests for home ID sharing from any terminals without the determination regarding the master terminal.

When a communication device detects connection to a home network the communication device broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals in the home network. Only a communication device M selected as the master terminal from among communication devices receiving the request responds to the request. The communication device receiving the response registers home ID received with the response into the communication device itself.

A communication device according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings. The communication device according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention reads terminal device information regarding a terminal device from the terminal device by using a NFC function and transfers the terminal device information to a server via a general purpose network.

The terminal device Y is a device having a NFC function RF ID unit IC tag or NFC tag emulation . The terminal device Y is for example an electronic terminal device such as a refrigerator a microwave a washing machine a TV or a recording device. The terminal device Y has an internal memory for holding as terminal device information a product serial number that is ID for identifying the terminal device Y use history information of the terminal device Y error information and the like.

The communication device Y has a NFC function for communicating with the NFC function of the terminal device Y by proximity wireless communication. The communication device Y includes a reader writer function of reading the terminal device information from the terminal device Y. The communication device Y is for example a portable device such as a mobile phone or a remote controller terminal of a TV.

The server Y is a server connected to the communication device Y in order to communicate with the communication device Y via a general purpose network such as the Internet. The server Y includes a database DB for accumulating the terminal device information that is read from the terminal device Y to the communication device Y.

The terminal device Y includes a CPU Y a failure sensor unit Y a use history logging unit Y a memory Y a modulation unit Y and an antenna Y.

The CPU Y is a unit that controls a system of the terminal device Y. The CPU Y controls the failure sensor unit Y the use history logging unit Y the memory Y and the modulation unit Y which are units included in the terminal device.

The failure sensor unit Y is a unit that detects a location and detail of a failure occurred in each unit included in the terminal device Y. A piece of failure information detected by the failure sensor unit Y is accumulated in a RAM in the memory Y. The detected failure information is represented by an error code that is uniquely defined depending on a location and condition of the failure.

The use history logging unit Y is a unit that performs logging for each piece of use history information every time the terminal device Y is operated by the user. The use history information applied with logging is accumulated into the RAM Y in the memory Y. In general when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred several pieces of use history information up to occurrence of the failure have high priorities of being examined. Therefore it is desirable that the use history logging unit Y according to the eleventh embodiment uses the RAM Y as First In First Out FIFO to chronologically accumulate new pieces of use history information into the RAM Y. Moreover when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred it is desirable that several pieces of use history information up to a timing detected by the failure sensor unit Y are stored as priorities into the RAM. Therefore if when five minor failures are detected in using the terminal device Y several pieces of operation use history information up to the five failures are stored as priorities.

The ROM Y previously stores at least a product serial number for uniquely identifying the terminal device Y when the terminal device Y has been shipped. The user of the terminal device Y cannot update the information previously held in the ROM Y. The product serial number is desirably information by which a manufacturer a manufacturing lot number and a manufacturing date of the terminal device Y can be determined. It is also desirable that the ROM Y is embedded in a semiconductor chip of the CPU Y. This structure prevents information during memory access to be easily inspected. Therefore secret key information for authentication and encrypted communication in proximity wireless communication with the communication device can be recorded on the ROM Y when shipping.

The RAM Y is a rewritable memory in which the failure information detected by the failure sensor unit Y and the use history information applied with logging of the use history logging unit Y are accumulated.

The modulation unit Y is a unit that modulates communication data for proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y. The modulation method varies depending on employed NFC standard. For example Amplitude Shift Keying ASK Frequency Shift Keying FSK Phase Shift Keying PSK and the like are used.

The antenna Y generates electromagnetic induction from radio waves emitted from an antenna of the communication device Y. The antenna Y performs at least processing of providing power to the modulation unit Y and the memory Y to be operated. In addition the antenna Y overlaps reflected waves of the radio waves emitted from the communication device Y with signals modulated by the modulation unit Y to transmit the terminal device information that is stored in the memory Y to the communication device Y.

As described above the terminal device according to the eleventh embodiment detects failures occurred in each unit included in the terminal device. Then the terminal device performs logging for use histories to accumulate the use histories into the memory. Then if the terminal device is moved into proximity of the communication device Y to be capable of performing proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y the terminal device can transmit the terminal device information stored in the memory into the communication device Y.

Next the communication device Y according to the eleventh embodiment is described. It should be noted that the subject of the eleventh embodiment is the communication device Y.

The communication device Y includes an antenna Y a CPU Y a demodulation unit Y a memory Y a position information determination unit Y a GPS antenna Y a communication memory Y an information adding unit Y and a communication unit Y.

The antenna Y performs polling for calling any terminal devices in order to search for a terminal device communicable with the communication device Y by proximity wireless communication. In receiving a response to the polling the antenna Y establishes proximity wireless communication with the responding terminal device Y to receive modulated terminal device information from the terminal device Y and provides the modulated terminal device information to the demodulation unit Y. In general the polling processing is always necessary even if there is no terminal device communicable with the communication device Y by proximity wireless communication. This consumes power. Therefore the communication device Y is provided with a switch not shown for controlling a timing of start of polling so that polling processing is performed when the switch is turned ON. This structure can significantly shorten a time period of the polling. As a result the power consumption amount can be considerably reduced. This is especially efficient when the communication device Y operates by a limited power source such as a battery.

The CPU Y is a unit that controls a system of the communication device Y. The CPU Y controls operations of each unit included in the communication device Y.

The modulation unit Y is a unit that demodulates data modulated by the modulation unit Y of the terminal device Y. The demodulated terminal device information is temporarily stored into the memory Y.

The ROM Y is a memory that cannot be rewritten by the outside. The ROM Y previously holds a product serial number for uniquely identifying the communication device Y when the communication device Y has been shipped. The product serial number is desirably information by which a manufacturer a manufacturing lot number and a manufacturing date of the communication device Y can be determined. It is also desirable that the ROM Y is embedded in a semiconductor chip of the CPU Y. This structure prevents information during memory access from being easily inspected. Therefore secret key information for authentication and encrypted communication in proximity wireless communication with the terminal device Y can be recorded on the ROM Y when shipping.

The RAM Y holds the terminal device information of the terminal device Y which is received by the antenna Y and demodulated by the demodulation unit Y. As described earlier the terminal device information includes the product serial number for uniquely identifying the terminal device Y the use history information of the terminal device Y and failure codes.

The position information determination unit Y is a group of sensors for determining a location of the communication device Y. The position information determination unit Y includes a latitude longitude positioning unit GPS Y an altitude positioning unit Y and a position correction unit Y. The position information determination unit Y does not need to always determine a location of the communication device Y location information if the location information is generated at a timing where the communication device Y becomes communicable with the terminal device Y using the antenna Y. As a result power consumption of the communication device Y can be reduced.

The latitude longitude positioning unit Y is a general Global Positioning System GPS that receives radio waves from satellites to perform 3 dimensional positioning of the earth.

The altitude positioning unit Y is a general altimeter. The altitude positioning unit Y may be any various altimeters such as an altimeter receiving radio waves to extract an altitude an altimeter detecting an air pressure to measure an altitude and the like. The altitude positioning unit Y is provide to the communication device Y so that an altitude can be detected even in a building where GPS cannot receive radio waves.

The position correction unit Y is a unit that corrects a value measured by the GPS to generate more accurate position information. In general when radio waves from satellites cannot be received in a room or the like the GPS cannot generate correct position information. Therefore the position correction unit Y includes an electronic compass and a 6 axis acceleration sensor. The electronic compass is used to detect a direction in which the communication device Y moves and the acceleration sensor is used to detect a speed of the movement. Thereby it is possible to correct position information generated by the GPS in a location where the GPS is difficult.

Regarding the information adding unit Y when the terminal device information that has been provided from the terminal device Y and stored into the memory Y is to be transmitted to the server Y the information adding unit Y adds a the product serial number of the communication device Y that is stored in the ROM Y in the memory Y and b the position information measured by the position information determination unit Y to the terminal device information. This enables the server Y to determine which communication device transmits the terminal device information where the transmitting terminal device is located for example and then manage the results of the determination. For example if a manufacturer of the terminal device finds that the terminal device has a possibility of causing serious accidents the information in the database of the server Y allows the manufacturer to determine where the terminal device is. Thereby the possibility of causing serious accidents can be reduced. As a result it is possible to increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal device. Furthermore when the communication device Y has a display function as mobile phone terminals have the above described terminal device information generated by the information adding unit Y makes it possible to determine with which communication device the terminal device having a possibility of accidents can perform proximity wireless communication and thereby display a notification of the possibility of accidents in the terminal device on the communication device Y. Thereby even if such a terminal device generally does not have any display function and is not connected to a general purpose network it is possible to transmit a notification of the accident possibility of the terminal device to the communication device Y in order to warn the user using the terminal device. As a result it is also possible to provide a terminal device that can increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal device.

The communication unit Y is a unit that communicates with the server Y via the Internet by using general LAN wireless LAN or mobile phone network. Thereby the communication unit Y transmits to the server Y the terminal device information added with the product serial number and the position information of the communication device Y as the communication device information. Here the added terminal device information is further added with a MAC address and an IP address to be transmitted to the server Y.

The server Y is connected to the communication device Y via a general purpose network such as the Internet. The server Y includes a device management database DB for managing the terminal device information.

The device management DB Y stores the terminal device information in association with the communication device information. In the device management DB Y according to the eleventh embodiment the communication device information is managed as parent device information and the terminal device information is managed as child device information in association with the parent device information. The child device information is added with the position information generated by the communication device in order to manage further information indicating where the terminal device is.

As described above in the system according to the eleventh embodiment the terminal device information is read from the terminal device by the communication device using proximity wireless communication. The communication device is touched to the terminal device to communicate with the terminal device to obtain the terminal device information. The communication device adds a product serial number and position information of the communication device to the obtained terminal device information and transmits the generated information to the server. Thereby the server can manage the communication device information as parent device information in association with the terminal device information as child device information. Therefore if a manufacturer of the terminal device finds that the terminal device would cause serious accidents the manufacture can easily recall the terminal device or display a notification of a possibility of the serious accident on a display unit of the communication device. As a result it is possible to achieve traceability of the products and to provide the users of the products with safety and security.

First the communication device Y performs polling to the terminal device Y to establish proximity wireless communication. In terms of power consumption amount of the communication device it is desirable as described earlier that a switch operated by a user is provided so that the polling is performed while the switch is being pressed or the polling starts when the switch is pressed SY .

Next the terminal device Y sends a response to the polling to the communication device Y in order to establish proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y SY . At this timing the position information determination unit Y of the communication device Y generates position information of a current position to be used as position information of the terminal device Y. The generation of the position information is not limited to be performed only in completion of the polling. The position information may be generated any time while the proximity wireless communication is established after the response to the polling. It is important to determine the position of the terminal device at a high accuracy by generating position information of the position where proximity wireless communication which can be performed when a distance between communicating devices is only several centimeters is established.

After the establishment of the proximity wireless communication at SY mutual authentication between the terminal device Y and the communication device Y is performed using general public key cryptography and also key sharing is temporarily performed to share cryptography keys generated by the terminal device Y and the communication device Y between the devices SY . After that while the proximity wireless communication is established data on the communication path is encrypted using the cryptography keys to communicate between the devices. As a result tapping of the data can be prevented.

After completing the key sharing the terminal device Y transmits the terminal device information recorded on the memory Y of the terminal device Y to the communication device Y SY .

When the communication device Y receives the terminal device information from the terminal device Y the communication device Y stores the received terminal device information into the memory Y of the communication device Y SY .

When the communication device Y completes receiving of the terminal device information from the terminal device Y the communication device Y issues a connection request to the server Y SY .

The server Y responds to the connection request of SY to establish communication with the communication device Y SY .

After establishing communication between the communication device Y and the server Y the communication device Y adds the communication device information of the communication device Y to the terminal device information of the terminal device Y to be transmitted to the server Y SY . Here the communication device information includes for example a product serial number of the communication device Y position information of the communication device Y when proximity wireless communication with the terminal device Y is established an e mail address of the user registered in the communication device Y if any a connection account to the server Y registered in the communication device Y if any and the like.

After adding the communication device information to the terminal device information at SY then the communication device Y transmits the terminal device information added with the communication device information to the server Y SY .

The server Y registers the terminal device information added with the communication device information received from the communication device Y into the device management DB Y. Thereby the processing is completed.

Thereby the server Y can manage pieces of information regarding devices for each house by managing information of each terminal device Y which establishes proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y touching the terminal device Y in association with identification information product serial number or the like of the communication device Y. In addition for the position information registered as information of a position at which the terminal device is equipped position information indicating a position where proximity wireless communication is established between the communication device Y and the terminal device Y is used. Since the proximity wireless communication according to the eleventh embodiment is performed at common High Frequency HF of 13.56 MHz the communication is possible when a distance between communicating devices is within several centimeters. Therefore if the position information detected in establishing proximity wireless communication is set to be position information of the terminal device a maximum error is several centimeters which results in assuring an enough accuracy to achieve traceability of the products.

When the user intends to perform user registration or the like for a terminal device using the communication device Y in purchasing the terminal device the following processing is performed. The user equips the terminal device and touches the terminal device by the communication device Y. Thereby terminal device information of the terminal information is provided to the communication device Y using proximity wireless communication. The communication device Y adds the communication device information of the communication device Y to the terminal device information in order to be transmitted to the server Y. In receiving the terminal device information added with the communication device information the server Y manages the terminal device information as child device information and the communication device information as parent device information in association with each other in the device management DB. For example in the device management DB terminal device information of a terminal device for example a microwave Y terminal device information of a terminal device for example a washing machine Y and terminal device information of a terminal device for example a TV Y all of which are touched by a communication device Y are managed in association with a product serial number of the communication device Y. Each of the terminal device information includes whereabout information longitude latitude altitude and the like and use status information use histories error codes use time periods and the like . Thereby the server Y can manage pieces of information of devices for each house because the communication device Y touches these terminal devices. As a result traceability of the terminal devices can be achieved.

Furthermore the communication device generates position information when proximity wireless communication with the terminal device is established and uses the generated position information as position information of the terminal device. Therefore it is possible to register a position of the terminal device with an error of several centimeters which is a distance capable for proximity wireless communication between devices. Since the GPS in the communication device is used to generate the position information of the terminal device each terminal device does not have a GPS thereby reducing a cost.

First the description is given for the situation where the communication device Y touches the terminal device Y to register information of the terminal device Y into the server Y.

When the user operates the communication device Y to start up a reader writer application of the communication device Y the communication device Y displays on a display screen a message persuading the user to touch the terminal device Y for proximity wireless communication Y .

When the communication device Y touches the terminal device Y proximity wireless communication is established between the devices. The communication device Y reads terminal device information of the terminal device Y from the terminal device Y generates position information of a current position and provides the pieces of information to the memory in which the pieces of information are temporarily stored. Then the communication device Y establishes communication with the server Y and transmits the terminal device information added with communication device information of the communication device Y to the server Y. The server Y determines whether or not the terminal device information has already been registered in the device management DB. If it is determined that the terminal device information has not yet been registered in the device management DB then the server Y causes the communication device Y to display on the display unit of the communication device Y a message asking the user whether or not to register information of the terminal device Y Y .

Next when the user selects to register the information of the terminal device Y the server Y causes the communication device Y to display a message asking the user whether or not to register position information of the terminal device. When the user selects to register the position information the server Y registers the position information associated with the terminal device information transmitted from the communication device Y to the server Y into the device management DB of the server Y as position information of the terminal device Y Y .

Next the description is given for the situation where the position information of the terminal device Y is different from the position information registered in the device management DB of the server Y.

When the user operates the communication device Y to start up a reader writer application of the communication device Y the communication device Y displays on the display screen a message persuading the user to touch the terminal device Y by the communication device Y to perform proximity wireless communication Y .

When the communication device Y touches the terminal device Y proximity wireless communication is established between the devices. The communication device Y reads terminal device information of the terminal device Y from the terminal device Y generates position information and transmits the terminal device information added with communication device information of the communication device Y to the server Y. The server Y compares a a product serial number of the terminal device which is included in the received terminal device information to b a product serial number registered in the device management DB in order to examine whether or not information of the touched terminal device is already registered in the server Y. In addition the server Y extracts the position information from the received communication device information and examines whether or not the extracted position information is identical to the position information registered in the device management DB. Since the position information has an error of course the determination is made to compare the position information to a threshold value that has the order of several centimeters in other words the threshold value is a value corresponding to a distance between devices capable for proximity wireless communication . If it is determined that the extracted position information is different from the registered position information the server Y causes the communication device Y to display on the display unit a message notifying the user of the result of the determination Y .

Then the communication device Y displays on the display unit a message asking the user whether or not to update the position information of the terminal device Y to information of a current position of the terminal device Y Y .

If the user selects to update the position information the communication device Y registers the position information generated by touching the terminal device Y by the communication device Y into the device management DB of the server Y as new position information of the terminal device Y.

Therefore according to the eleventh embodiment even if the position information that has been registered is changed because the terminal device Y is moved and equipped at a different location it is possible to update the position information to new position information that is generated by touching the terminal device Y by the communication device Y. Thereby an accuracy of traceability of the terminal device Y can be improved.

The CPU N in the mobile device N monitors the position information stored in the position information storage unit N to determine whether or not predetermined conditions are satisfied. If the predetermined conditions are satisfied then the CPU N generates positional information including position information that is information of a current position of the mobile device N hereinafter referred to as current position information .

The positional information includes a second server login ID and a second server login password which are regarding the registration server N and b current position information. The second server login ID and the second server login password are previously obtained in purchasing the product and stored in a memory not shown . The current position information is obtained from the position information storage unit N.

The communication unit N illustrated in designates as a destination of the positional information an address of the registration server N in which information of the product is registered.

The transmission unit N transmits the positional information to the registration server N via the communication I F unit N in .

The receiving unit N in the registration server N receives the positional information via the communication I F unit N.

The communication unit N in the registration server N confirms the second server login ID and the second server login password in the received positional information.

If the second server login ID and the second server login password are correct then the communication unit N provides the positional information to the product control unit N illustrated in .

The product control unit N provides the second server login ID to the position information generation unit N illustrated in .

According to instructions from the product control unit N the position information generation unit N obtains pieces of product information as illustrated in from the product information management unit N based on the second server login ID. Then the position information generation unit N generates a product map from pieces of position information of the respective products. The product map shows positions of the products in the house illustrated in . The position information generation unit N provides the generated product map to the product control unit N.

The product map is a 3D map or 3D product map in which illustrations of the products are arranged at positions based on the respective pieces of position information.

The product control unit N controls the products from the TV NA to the FF heater NK by using a the current position information of the mobile device N included in the positional information and b the product map or home appliance map generated by the position information generation unit N.

In this example the product control unit N turns ON a product located most close to the current position information received from the mobile device N. Here the product control unit N generates product control information including an instruction for turning ON the air conditioner NJ.

The first product control information includes part number ID of the air conditioner NJ UID of the air conditioner NJ and a product control command for turning ON the air conditioner NJ.

The communication unit N designates an address of the mobile device N to be a designation of the first product control information.

The transmission unit N transmits the first product control information to the mobile device N via the communication I F unit N in .

After receiving the first product control information the mobile device N transfers the first product control information to the air conditioner NJ based on the part number ID and the UID in the first product control information in .

When the air conditioner NJ receives the first product control information from the communication I F unit N the air conditioner NJ turns ON a power source of the air conditioner NJ if the power source is OFF.

Next the product control unit N turns OFF a product located the farthest from the current position information received from the mobile device N. Here the product control unit N generates product control information including an instruction for turning OFF the TV NA.

The second product control information includes part number ID of the TV NA UID of the TV NA and a product control command for turning OFF the TV NA.

The communication unit N designates an address of the mobile device N to be a designation of the second product control information.

The transmission unit N transmits the second product control information to the mobile device N via the communication I F unit N in .

After receiving the second product control information the mobile device N transfers the second product control information to the TV NA based on the part number ID and the UID in the second product control information in .

When the TV NA receives the second product control information from the communication I F unit N the TV NA turns OFF a power source of the TV NA if the power source is ON.

As described above according to the twelfth embodiment of the present invention proximity wireless communication of RF ID technology and position information are used to manage in the registration server N positions of products each having the RF ID unit N.

Thereby it is possible to automatically control the products according to a current position of the mobile device N.

Regarding the position information information detected by the 6 axis sensor N motion sensor that measures relative position information is used as position information. Therefore it is possible to update the position information by using the detected results of the 6 axis sensor N when the mobile device N is outside an area in which the GPS N can perform positioning. As a result correct position information can be obtained even outside the area.

It should be noted that the mobile device N according to the twelfth embodiment has been described to have the GPS N and the 6 axis sensor N but the mobile device N is not limited to the above described structure. For example the mobile device N may have only the 6 axis sensor N. In this aspect the product information management unit N in the registration server N stores pieces of relative position information of products which are relative to a reference point position information of the TV NA which is first registered as illustrated in . Here a product map generated by the position information generation unit N has axes of an x coordinate a y coordinate and a z coordinate as illustrated in .

It should also be noted that it has been described in the twelfth embodiment that a part number ID and UID of a target product which are stored in the RF ID unit N of the target product and b position information of the mobile device N are registered to the registration server N but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example if the registration server N receives again server registration information regarding a product for which registration has already been completed the registration server N may perform processing as illustrated in .

The following describes . Referring to the table includes a accuracy identifiers for identifying an accuracy of position information b part number ID in association with each accuracy identifier and c processing to be performed when position information in re received server registration information is different from position information registered in the product information management unit N.

If the registration server N determines based on the part number ID and the UID included in the re received server registration information that the position information has already been registered in the product information management unit N then the registration server N checks the part number ID. If the part number ID indicates a TV a BD recorder or an FF heater the registration server N updates the position information in the product information management unit N to the position information in the re received server registration information.

If the part number ID indicates an air conditioner a solar panel or a fire alarm then the registration server N notifies the mobile device N of the position information stored in the product information management unit N. The mobile device N thereby corrects current position information of the mobile device N based on the position information received from the registration server N.

It should also be noted that shows the two kinds of accuracy identifiers but the accuracy identifiers are not limited to the two kinds. It is possible to set more than two kinds of accuracy identifiers for respective different processing.

It should also be noted that the product control unit N in the twelfth embodiment is included in the registration server N but the present invention is not limited to the structure. For example the product control unit N may be included in the mobile device N so that the product control unit N obtains a product map from the registration server N to control products. Besides in the mobile device N the product control unit N may also be included in a home server not illustrated that is connected to the hone network N. In this aspect the mobile device N transmits position information to the home server and obtains a product map from the home server.

It should be noted that the mobile device N according to the twelfth embodiment is connected to the registration server N via the home network N and the external network N by using the communication I F unit general purpose I F unit N but the present invention is not limited to the above.

Furthermore the mobile device N may have an interface connectable to a circuit network such as WiMAX so as to be connected to the registration server N via at least the WiMAX network. Any other networks can be used to connect the mobile device N to the registration server N.

It should also be noted that in the twelfth embodiment the product map generated by the position information generation unit N is used to determine how to control products but the present invention is not limited to the structure. For example image data of the product map generated by the position information generation unit N is transmitted to the mobile device N that displays the image data on the display unit N.

It should also be noted that in the twelfth embodiment the position information generation unit N generates the product map based on the information illustrated in but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example pieces product information of products located near the position information of the mobile device N in the same house are detected from the product information management unit N and then used to generate a product map regarding nearby products in the house. In this aspect the product control unit N performs product control by combining the product map of and the product map of nearby products. For instance it is assumed in the twelfth embodiment that the TV NA which is the farthest from the mobile device N is turned OFF but there is a solar panel near the mobile device N in the house. Under the assumption the product control unit N controls the TV NA to be turned ON for example.

It should also be noted that in the twelfth embodiment the product information management unit N in the registration server N stores part number ID UID and position information of each product but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that a power state ON or OFF is obtained in real time from each product via the communication I F unit N of the product and then managed in the product information management unit N. The product control unit N thereby controls power of the TV NA located the farthest from the mobile device N to be kept ON when the predetermined number of products are powered OFF although it has been described in the above description that the product control unit N turns OFF the TV NA.

It should also be noted that in the twelfth embodiment the product control unit N turns OFF a product located the farthest from the mobile device N and turns ON a product closest to the mobile device N. However the present invention is not limited to the above.

The product control unit N may control power to be turned ON or OFF for a plurality of products based on the position information of the mobile device N.

It should also be noted that in the twelfth embodiment the product control unit N turns OFF a product located the farthest from the mobile device N and turns ON a product closest to the mobile device N. However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that the CPU N in the mobile device N stores position information as a movement history into a memory not illustrated and regularly provides the movement history to the registration server N. In this aspect the registration server N estimates from the movement histories of the mobile device N which product is located in which room or which floor and manages results of the estimation. It is further possible that the product control unit N controls power to be turned ON or OFF for each product in the same house based on the estimation results. For example if it is estimated from the movement histories that the TV NA and the air conditioner NC are located in the same room the product control unit N turns OFF the air conditioner NC when the TV NA is turned OFF.

In addition to the moving histories it is also possible to obtain a time of switching ON or OFF each product thereby estimating which product is in the same room or the same floor.

It should also be noted that in the twelfth embodiment the product information management unit N manages the product information illustrated in B or and the position information generation unit N generates the product map illustrated in or . However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that image data of a room arrangement created by the user is transmitted from the mobile device N to the registration server N and therefore managed by the product information management unit N. In this aspect the position information generation unit N generates a product map as illustrated in by combining a product information illustrated in B or and b the image data of the room arrangement.

Here private information such as the image data of room arrangement may be applied with encryption different from encryption employed for the product information and then transmitted from the mobile device N to the registration server N.

It is also possible that private information such as the image data of room arrangement is transmitted to a server different from the server receiving the product information and a product map is generated with reference to the different server when the registration server N generates the product map.

It should also be noted that the twelfth embodiment may be combined with any other embodiments. For example it is possible that the function of the terminal device Y according to the eleventh embodiment is provided to the RF ID unit N according to the twelfth embodiment and the function of the communication device Y according to the eleventh embodiment is provided to the mobile device N according to the twelfth embodiment. Thereby the series of processes including the polling the mutual authentication and the key sharing illustrated in can be performed prior to the product registration processing of . Any combination of the embodiments is within a scope of the present invention.

It should also be noted that the units in the above described embodiments may be typically implemented into a Large Scale Integration LSI which is an integrated circuit. These may be integrated separately or a part or all of them may be integrated into a single chip. Here the integrated circuit is referred to as a LSI but the integrated circuit can be called an IC a system LSI a super LSI or an ultra LSI depending on their degrees of integration. The technique of integrated circuit is not limited to the LSI and it may be implemented as a dedicated circuit or a general purpose processor. It is also possible to use a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA that can be programmed after manufacturing the LSI or a reconfigurable processor in which connection and setting of circuit cells inside the LSI can be reconfigured.

Furthermore if due to the progress of semiconductor technologies or their derivations new technologies for integrated circuits appear to be replaced with the LSIs it is of course possible to use such technologies to implement the functional blocks as an integrated circuit. For example biotechnology and the like can be applied to the above implementation.

The following describes processing of registering the product information of the product having the RF ID device O into the first server O.

If the mobile device O touches the RF ID device O to be able to perform proximity wireless communication with the RF ID device O the mobile device O supplies power and clock to the RF ID device O that thereby starts operating.

With the power supply the RF ID device O modulates the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O which are stored in a nonvolatile memory. The accuracy identifier O represents an accuracy of an absolute position of a product having the RF ID device O. The RF ID device O then transmits the modulated pieces of information to the mobile device O.

In receiving the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O by the antenna O the mobile device O demodulates the received pieces of information in the RF ID device O.

The URL unit O extracts the first server URL O and provides the extracted first server URL O to the communication unit O.

The coordinate accuracy identification information O extracts the accuracy identifier O and provides the extracted accuracy identifier O to the determination unit O.

The RF ID detection unit O provides the coordinate information sending unit O and the reference coordinate unit O with a trigger for notifying of the receipt of the pieces of information from the RF ID device O.

In receiving the trigger the coordinate information sending unit O provides the communication unit O with the position information of the mobile device N which is received from the position information output unit O.

Here the description is given for the position information of the mobile device O outputted by the position information output unit O.

First the absolute coordinate calculation unit O receives a a result of integrating by the integrator O results detected by the angular velocity sensors O to O and b a result of integrating by the integrator O results detected by the acceleration sensors O to O. Here the absolute coordinate calculation unit O may receive also direction information from the magnetic sensors O O and O. This aspect can eliminate the angular velocity sensors thereby reducing a cost.

In the absolute coordinate calculation unit O the position information correction unit O and the direction information correction unit O correct the results of the integrators O and O by using the information stored in the position information unit and the information stored in the direction information O. The information stored in the position information unit is a calculation result of the position information calculation unit O using the satellite antenna O. The information stored in the direction information O is a direction indicated by the magnetic compass O. The angular velocity sensors O O and Oare used to estimate a distance of a travel of the mobile device O. When a user of the mobile device O walks a step count detection calculation unit Ocalculates a walking travel distance from walking steps of the user thereby determining a position coordinates of the mobile device O. When the user having the mobile device O enters a house it is difficult for the mobile device O to receive radio waves from GPS satellites. An accuracy of the positioning is significantly lowered or the radio waves cannot be received. In the situation the step count detection calculation unit Ois used instead to estimate a direction of the walking travel by detecting direction by the three axis magnetic sensors and acceleration by the three axis acceleration sensors. Additional use of the three axis angular velocity sensors detecting an angular velocity can determine absolute coordinates of the position of the mobile device O. The mobile device O first obtains correct absolute coordinates from the GPS satellites. And then when radio waves of the GPS satellites become weak the mobile device O switches the GPS to the positioning means using acceleration geomagnetism and angular velocity. Thereby the absolute coordinates can be kept correct at least in a certain time period. Furthermore it is also possible that correct absolute coordinates are recorded on a RF ID reader or a RF ID tag provided to a door opening closing at an entrance of a house a hospital room and or the like. In this aspect a portable device the mobile device O can read the correct absolute coordinates when the portable device is used to unlock the door for authentication. As a result the absolute coordinates can be regularly calibrated. As described above it is possible even in a house to obtain correct absolute coordinates without receiving radio waves from GPS satellites. Therefore in the house when the portable device is brought into proximity of a RF ID device of a product such as an air conditioner a TV or a DVD recorder in order to read data from the RF ID device the portable device operating at a frequency of 13.5 MHz is not far from the product more than 5 cm. If the portable device holds correct absolute coordinates the portable device can transmit to a server a product name and a product serial number of the product and a MAC address which are obtained from the RF ID device when the portable device is in proximity of the product namely touches the product and the correct absolute coordinates in association with each other. Thereby it is possible to offer significant advantages of recording onto a server absolute coordinates on the earth regarding each product with an accuracy having an error within 5 cm.

Next the absolute coordinate calculation unit O provides the corrected direction information in the direction information unit O and the corrected position information in the position information unit O to the position information output unit O.

The position information output unit O generates position information from the corrected direction information in the direction information unit O and the corrected position information in the position information unit O.

By the above described processing the mobile device O eventually generates position information current position information of the mobile device O.

Then the program execution unit O provides the product ID and the service ID which are stored in the RF ID storage unit O to the communication unit O.

The communication unit O generates data information including a the position information provided from the coordinate information sending unit O and b the product ID and the service ID provided from the program execution unit O. The communication unit O designates the first server URL notified from the URL unit O to be a destination address of the data and provides the data and the address to the transmission unit O. The transmission unit O modulates the data and transmits the modulated data to the first server O via the communication antenna O.

The registered coordinate information unit O stores the information of the mobile device O as parent device information and the information of the RF ID device O as child device information in association with each other. In more detail the product ID O and the service ID O which are information of the product having the RF ID device O child device are managed in association with the position information of a position at which the mobile device O parent device receives the product ID O and the service ID O from the RF ID device O.

The following describes processing performed by the mobile device O to generate a 3D map of products a 3D product map . Each of the products has the RF ID device and has been registered by the mobile device O onto the first server O.

In a living room on the first floor a TV OA a BD recorder OB and an air conditioner OC are arranged. In a Japanese room on the first floor an air conditioner OD is arranged. On the second floor a TV OE and an air conditioner OF are arranged. Each of the above products is embedded with the RF ID device O. It is assumed that coordinates of a position of each product have already been registered to the registered coordinate information unit O connected to the first server O by using the mobile device O employing the above described processing for registering product information stored in the RF ID device O.

First the communication unit O in the mobile device O generates product information request data to be used to request the first server O to provide the product information registered by using the mobile device O.

The transmission unit O modulates the product information request data and transmits the modulated data to the first server O via the communication antenna O.

In receiving the product information request data the first server O generates product information response data and transmits the generated data to the mobile device O. The product information response data includes the child product information that managed in association with the mobile device O as its parent device.

In this example the product information response data includes the product ID O the service ID and the position information regarding each of the TV OA the BD recorder OB the air conditioner OC the air conditioner OD the TV OE and the air conditioner OF.

Based on the position information of each product included in the product information response data the second server O extracts from the building coordinate database O image data including position coordinate information of a building hereinafter building coordinate information located at the same position as that of each product.

The receiving unit O in the mobile device O receives the product information response data via the communication antenna O then modulates the received information and provides the modulated information to the communication unit O.

The program execution unit O generates image data of a 3D map of products as illustrated in using the position information of each of the products which is information included in the product information response data. In the 3D map the products are mapped as different icons on respective coordinates based on the corresponding position information so that the user can learn the arrangement of the products at a glance.

The data processing unit O provides the image data to the memory unit O in which the image data is temporarily stored.

The display unit Odisplays image data of the 3D map of products illustrated in which is stored in the memory unit O.

Next in receiving the building coordinate information from the second server O via the communication antenna O the receiving unit O in the mobile device O demodulates the received building coordinate information and provides the demodulated information to the building coordinate information output unit O.

The building coordinate information output unit O analyzes the building coordinate information and provides the building coordinate information to the display unit O

The display unit Odisplays image data of a 3D product map as illustrated in . The displayed image data is a combination of the image data of and the already displayed image data of .

As described above it is possible to generate a 3D product map which the user having the mobile device O can see an arrangement of products at a glance.

Next the description is given for the processing performed by the mobile device O to correct the position information of the mobile device O by using the building coordinate information.

It is assumed in this example that product information of the air conditioner OD in is to be registered to the first server O.

Here the processing until when the first server O receives data including product ID and service ID from the mobile device O is the same as the processing described previously and therefore is not explained again below.

In receiving the product information of the air conditioner OD the first server O transmits the position information of the air conditioner DD to the second server O.

The second server O extracts from the building coordinate database O the building coordinate information of corresponding to the position information of the air conditioner OD. Then the second server O transmits the extracted building coordinate information to the first server O.

If the product to be registered is a product usually fixed to a wall or somewhere such as an air conditioner the first server O compares a the position information of the air conditioner that is indicated in the building coordinate information to b the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O. If the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O is not close to a wall the first server O transmits to the mobile device O the position information hereinafter referred to also as building coordinate information of the air conditioner that is indicated in the building coordinate information.

In receiving the building coordinate information the receiving unit O in the mobile device O demodulates the building coordinate information and provides the demodulated information to the building coordinate information output unit O. The building coordinate information output unit O determines based on the building coordinate information and the position information of the air conditioner that the current position information of the mobile device O is to be corrected. Then the building coordinate information output unit O provides the building coordinate information to the position information correction unit O.

The position information correction unit O corrects the current position information of the mobile device O based on the building coordinate information provided from the building coordinate information output unit O.

Next the mobile device O registers information of the air conditioner OD into the first server O in association with the corrected current position information of the mobile device O.

As described above a the position information of the air conditioner that is indicated in the building coordinate information is compared to b the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O. Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not b the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O is deviated from a correct position. As a result the position information of the mobile device O can be corrected.

It should be noted that it has been described that the first server O receives the building coordinate information from the second server O for the determination. However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that the mobile device O obtains the building coordinate information from the second server O before transmitting information to be registered to the first server O and that the mobile device O compares the building coordinate information to the position information of the air conditioner OD to determine whether or not the position information of the mobile device O is to be corrected.

Next the description is given for the processing performed by the mobile device O to correct the position information of the mobile device O by using the accuracy identifier.

It is assumed that the product information of the air conditioner OC has already been registered to the first server O and the mobile device O touches the air conditioner OC.

When the mobile device O receives via the antenna O the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O from the RF ID device O of the air conditioner OC the RF ID unit O in the mobile device O demodulates these pieces of information.

At this stage the mobile device O does not know whether the product information of the air conditioner OC has already been registered in the first server O. Therefore the mobile device O transmits to the first server O data including the position information of the mobile device O the product ID and the service ID by the product registration processing as described previously.

If the registered coordinate information unit O determines that the product information of the air conditioner OC has already been registered then the first server O generates data including the position information of the air conditioner OC that is registered in the registered coordinate information unit O and then transmits the generated data to the mobile device O.

When the receiving unit O in the mobile device O receives the position information of the air conditioner OC via the communication antenna O the receiving unit O demodulates the received position information and provides the demodulated information to the registered coordinate unit O.

The registered coordinate unit O extracts the position information from the data including the position information of the air conditioner OC and provides the extracted position information to the determination unit O.

The determination unit O determines whether or not the position information received from the registered coordinate unit O is to be reference coordinates based on the accuracy identifier O of the RF ID device O received from the coordinate accuracy identification information O.

Regarding the accuracy identifier O the RF ID device O is previously assigned with an accuracy identifier for identifying each different product as illustrated in .

If the determination unit O determines that the position information of the mobile device O is to be corrected then the determination unit O provides the position information received from the registered coordinate unit O to the reference coordinate unit O.

Here if the accuracy identifier O represents a low accuracy then the mobile device O determines that it is not necessary to correct the position information of the mobile device O. Then the mobile device O notifies the determination result to the first server O. The first server stores the new position information of the air conditioner OC into the registered coordinate information unit. Thereby the processing is completed.

If there is a trigger from the RF ID detection unit O the reference coordinate unit O provides the position information received from the registered coordinate unit O to the position information correction unit O.

The position information correction unit O corrects the current position information of the mobile device O based on the position information received from the reference coordinate unit O.

Next the mobile device O notifies the first server O of that the position information is completed. Thereby the processing is completed.

As described above a the position information indicated in the building coordinate information is compared to b the position information generated by the mobile device O. Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not b the position information generated by the mobile device O is deviated from a correct position. As a result the position information of the mobile device O can be corrected thereby preventing unnecessary updating of the position information.

Furthermore products which are usually not moved from an initial equipped location are designated in a group of products having a high accuracy of the position coordinates. Thereby reliability of the accuracy can be improved.

If even position information of a product in the group having a high accuracy is deviated from a correct position more than predetermined times it is possible not to correct the position information newly generated by the mobile device O but to correct the position information registered in the registered coordinate information unit O.

It should be noted that it has been described that the mobile device O determines based on the accuracy identifier whether or not the position information is to be corrected. However the accuracy identifier may be transmitted to the first server O so that the first server O determines the necessity of the correction.

Next the description is given for processing performed by the mobile device O to manage relative positions of the products.

Here product registration is first performed for the TV OA. Then with reference to the position information of the TV OA as a reference point relative position information is generated for the BD recorder OB that is registered next.

When the mobile device O receives via the antenna O the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O from the RF ID device O of the TV OA the RF ID unit O in the mobile device O demodulates these pieces of information. The coordinate information sending unit O in the mobile device O provides the recording unit O with the position information determined in detecting the RF ID device O.

In receiving the position information the recording unit O records the received position information onto the position information storage unit O.

After that in the same product registration processing as described earlier the mobile device O registers the product information of the TV OA into the first server O.

When the mobile device O receives via the antenna O the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O from the RF ID device O of the BD recorder OB the RF ID unit O in the mobile device O demodulates these pieces of information.

The coordinate information sending unit O in the mobile device O provides the recording unit O with the position information determined in detecting the RF ID device O of the BD recorder OB.

The recording unit O does not record the position information of the BD recorder OB onto the position information storage unit O because the position information of the TV OA has already been recorded.

In receiving the position information from the coordinate information sending unit O the relative position calculation unit O obtains the position information of the TV OA from the position information storage unit O via the reproducing unit O.

Next the relative position calculation unit O calculates relative position information of the BD recorder OB which is relative to a reference position or a reference point that is the position information of the TV OA obtained via the reproducing unit O. Then the relative position calculation unit O stores the calculation result into the position information recording unit.

By the above described processing it is possible to generate relative position information of a product with reference to a position of a different certain product.

It should be noted that it has been described that relative position information is stored in the mobile device position information storage unit O . However the present invention is not limited to the above. It is also possible that the mobile device O transmits relative position information to the first server O that manages the received relative position information in the registered coordinate information unit O.

It should also be noted that it has been described that the position information of the TV OA for which product registration is performed at the first time is set to be the reference position. However the present invention is not limited to the above.

For example a position predetermined by the user may be set to be the reference point reference position . For instance the reference point may be a position of an entrance of a building. If the mobile device O is a remote controller terminal of a TV a position of the TV may be the reference point.

In the thirteenth embodiment the position information storage unit O in the mobile device O holds relative position information. However the present invention in not limited to the above. For example the following aspect is also possible. The coordinate information sending unit O in the mobile device O provides position information generated by the mobile device O to the recording unit O every time the position information is generated. The recording unit O thereby records the position information onto the position information storage unit O. The position information storage unit O accumulates the position information generated by the mobile device O. In this aspect the program execution unit O generates trajectory information of the mobile device O from pieces of the position information accumulated in the position information storage unit O. Thereby a travel of the mobile device O can be estimated form the trajectory information.

It should be noted that it has been described in the thirteenth embodiment that the processing of the determination unit O is performed based on the two kinds of accuracy identifiers in . However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example the following is also possible. Two or more kinds of product classification are set. A threshold value is defined for each kind of the classification to represent a different size of deviation from the position information. Based on the threshold value the determination unit O determines whether or not to correct the position information of the mobile device O.

It should also be noted that the thirteenth embodiment may be combined with any other embodiments of the present invention. For example it is also possible that the function of the communication device MS according to the tenth embodiment is provided to a product having the RF ID device O and the 3D map 3D product map as well as home ID are shared among products within the same house. In this aspect each product obtains the 3D map beforehand from the mobile device O using the NFC function.

It should also be noted that it has been described in the thirteenth embodiment that the RF ID device O is provided to TVs BD recorders air conditioners and the like. illustrates a system including products OG to ON each having the RF ID device O. Each of the products OG to ON also includes a specific small power wireless communication device for example Zigbee which enables the products to directly communicate with each other within a range in which radio waves can be received. It is assumed that each of the products OG to ON has already obtained a 3D map from the mobile device O via the RF ID device O. The 3D map shows an arrangement of the products OG to ON. It is also possible that the 3D map is held in a server. Or for another method each of the products OG to ON may have the communication antenna O in order to obtain via the internet the 3D map showing the product arrangement. Conventionally there is the following problem. Without position information of each product products other than minimum requisite products in a path need to be operated. Therefore unnecessary power consumption occurs. In the thirteenth embodiment however the position information makes it possible to select and operate only terminals on the shortest path between two products. Thereby power can be saved.

The following describes the situation where a product OH transmits data to a product OK by using the specific small power wireless communication device. The specific small power wireless communication device usually operates at a sleep mode in terms of power saving. At the sleep mode a power source of the specific small power wireless communication device is switched ON or OFF at regular intervals. Here timings of switching ON or OFF for the products are in synchronization with each other.

When the product OH needs to transmit data the specific small power wireless communication device in the product OH is switched to an awake mode. At the awake mode the power source of the specific small power wireless communication device is always ON.

The product OH examines the 3D map showing the arrangement of the products OG to ON which has previously been obtained. From the 3D map of the product arrangement the product OH determines products located between the product OH and the product OK. In this example a product OJ is determined from the 3D map to be a relay product to relay data.

When the product OJ receives the data addressed to the product OH the product OJ transfers the data to the OH. Then the product OJ is switched to the sleep mode.

As described above using the 3D map the product OH determines a relay product in order to transmit data and causes only the determined relay product product OJ to be switched to the awake mode. Thereby other products which do not need to be at the awake mode do not need to be switched to the awake mode. Without the 3D map in order to establish a path to the product OK the product OH needs to cause all products to be switched to search for the path. Here it is also possible that each of products which do not need to be at the awake mode is previously assigned by using the 3D map with an awake prohibition identifier for identifying a product for which the awake mode is prohibited.

It should also be noted that the units included in each of the above described embodiments may be implemented into a Large Scale Integration LSI that is typically an integrated circuit. These units may be integrated separately or a part or all of them may be integrated into a single chip. Here the integrated circuit is referred to as a LSI but the integrated circuit can be called an IC a system LSI a super LSI or an ultra LSI depending on their degrees of integration. The technique of integrated circuit is not limited to the LSI and it may be implemented as a dedicated circuit or a general purpose processor. It is also possible to use a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA that can be programmed after manufacturing the LSI or a reconfigurable processor in which connection and setting of circuit cells inside the LSI can be reconfigured.

Furthermore if due to the progress of semiconductor technologies or their derivations new technologies for integrated circuits appear to be replaced with the LSIs it is of course possible to use such technologies to implement the functional blocks as an integrated circuit. For example biotechnology and the like can be applied to the above implementation.

It should also be noted that the embodiment of the present invention employs the 3D map that is a wireframe image of a house see . However such house data is private information and 3D data is not generated for old buildings. Therefore until such 3D data becomes available for each general house it is necessary to obtain a room arrangement of a house without using 3D data of the house.

When there is no 3D data of a house an illustration is provided. In the illustration several air conditioners are arranged in a space that corresponds to the house. Without 3D data a room arrangement of a room having each of the air conditioners is not known.

Here as illustrated in each of the air conditioners which has a RF ID unit compliant to APE or a NFC IC and an antenna set OC is provided with a detection unit such as an ultrasonic sensor or an infrared sensor for detecting a distance or a position. Thereby it is possible to determine a relative position of the air conditioner which is relative to walls and pieces of furniture in the room. Here a mobile device such as a mobile phone which has the 3D mapping function as described in the embodiment of the present invention is brought into proximity of 5 cm or less from of the RF ID unit in the air conditioner. At this moment if the air conditioner has a wireless communication function the mobile device transmits to the air conditioner an access number such as AAID for wireless LAN or the like and a password and an authentication key for access. Thereby the air conditioner is connected to a network in the house. In addition in proximity of the RF ID unit the mobile device reads a product name a product serial number a MAC address and an authentication key from the RF ID unit. Then in transmitting these pieces of information to a server the mobile device also transmits to the air conditioner or the server 3D absolute coordinate information indicating the position of the mobile device . The absolute coordinate information is calibrated using a the previously described coordinate information of the relative position relative to walls and the like in the room and b1 relative position information in the house where the mobile device exists or b2 absolute coordinate information on the earth. Thereby it is possible to generate a 3D or 2D arrangement illustration of relative coordinates between the air conditioner and the room or absolute coordinates on the earth. Combination of pieces of 3D coordinate information of the several air conditioners can result in coordinate information showing a 3D or 2D arrangement of the rooms having the air conditioners in the house in other words a part of the wireframe image of the house as illustrated in . If the above described technique is employed for the three air conditioners in pieces of 3D mapping data of three rooms can be generated.

Since pieces of authentication data such as the MAC address and the authentication key which are used to be connected with other devices are also obtained it is possible to automatically perform connection authentication with the other devices such as TVs a DVD recorder and a refrigerator in the house via a network. This terminal is not necessary to be the air conditioner but also to be any electric and electronic devices in the house. Air purification device may be provided with a distance measuring sensor to server as the terminal. However the terminal is desirably a device such as an air conditioner which is equipped at a fixed location in a house because position coordinate information of such a device is not changed. In this example 3D coordinate information of only the rooms having the air conditioners can be generated. However since a user of the mobile device moves around in the house 3D trajectory information can be generated. The 3D trajectory information regarding position coordinates is analyzed and calculated by a server to estimate positions of entrances of the respective rooms positions of corridors and other positions. Thereby the 3D data showing the arrangement of the house is further developed. The above method can generate the 3D wireframe image of the house as illustrated in by estimation calculation of the server without 3D coordinate information of the house. Furthermore in the method by which the RF ID unit of the mobile device touches the RF ID reader at an opening closing entrance such as a front door of the house so as to unlock the key of the entrance if the position of the RF ID reader which is recorded onto the server or the RF ID reader has a high accuracy this means that an accuracy identifier of the position coordinates is high. The mobile device reads the position information from the RF ID unit at the entrance and examines an accuracy of the readout information. Therefore touching the RF ID unit the mobile device can calibrate absolute coordinates of the position of the mobile device. Thereby single touching can result in a locking unlocking of the key and b calibration of absolute or relative coordinates of the position of the mobile device.

For example the above technique is employed in each door of corridors in a hospital or RF ID readers for security release when entering and leaving the rooms. Thereby positions of doctors and nurses having the mobile devices can be managed with high accuracy in a server in the hospital when opening and closing the doors.

At present when mobile phones personal computers and in the further microwaves and air conditioners intend to communicate with a server it is desired to perform authentication for the devices or data entry in order to prevent malicious behaviors.

In the embodiment of the present invention each product in a house or a server associated with each product stores 3D coordinate information. The mobile device is brought into proximity of a product such as a microwave to read information from the product. Then when the mobile device communicates with the server the server causes the mobile device to transmit to the server position information of an actual current position of the mobile device while authenticating the mobile device. The server compares the position information received from the mobile device with position information registered in the microwave or another server linked to the server. Thereby the server determines whether or not a difference between the received position information and the registered position information is within a predetermined range. If the difference is within the predetermined range then the server determines that the received position information is correct and therefore downloads the position information. On the other hand if the difference is beyond the predetermined range then the server determines that the received position information does not match the registered position information and therefore stops data transmission or firmware downloading. Thereby it is possible to prevent unauthorized behaviors such that a malicious third person downloads a fire firmware to the microwave without authorization.

As described in the embodiment of the present invention position authorization that is authorization having a new concept can be added to conventional personal authentication using a password a finger print and the like. For example it can be implemented that authentication is not successful unless the mobile device performs transmission from a specific room such as an accounting department in a company. Since an unauthorized person performing transmission from other locations cannot be authenticated unauthorized behaviors can be prevented with high degree.

Moreover in the embodiment of the present invention authentication among the product such as a microwave the mobile device and the server has possible four modes.

The first mode is when a power plug of the microwave is not set in a power outlet. In this situation the mobile device is brought to proximity of or touch the NFC unit without a power source such as a RF ID unit of the microwave. Thereby the mobile device supplies power to the NFC unit and reads a product serial number a server address and the like from a memory in the NFC unit. Then the mobile device transmits the readout information to the server.

The second mode is when firmware is downloaded. In the situation there is a possibility that fire firmware is downloaded by a malicious third person without authorization. When the power plug is set in the outlet poser is supplied from the outlet to a CPU of the microwave to operate the microwave. Thereby the CPU with high performance encrypts and decrypts authentication information such as a random number which is provided from the server. Then the microwave transmits the authenticated information to the server via the NFC unit and the mobile device so that the server can perform authentication for the microwave. After establishment of the authentication the microwave downloads authorized firmware from the server. As a result it is possible to prevent unauthorized downloading of the firmware and impersonation. If the above authentication is added with the previously described authentication using coordinate information security is more improved.

In this case the CPU is operated only when authentication or the like needs to be performed. Therefore cryptography calculation can be performed with high security while reducing power consumption. As a result security of the authentication is improved.

The third mode is when a power plug of a home appliance product such as a microwave is set to a power outlet. In this situation when the mobile device is brought into proximity of the microwave the microwave supplies power and clock to the NFC unit. Once the mobile device is in proximity of the microwave a power source of the microwave is activated to supply power to the NFC unit. If the NFC unit has a CPU with a small load to perform cryptography calculation calculation of cryptography or the like takes a long time. If the mobile device moves away from the microwave the power supply is stopped and the calculation of the CPU is not completed. Therefore if power is supplied from the microwave the stable power supply prevents stop of the calculation. If the mobile device is in proximity of the microwave once the calculation is completed. It is not necessary to hold the mobile device in proximity of the microwave for a long time or a plurality of times. As a result responsiveness is dramatically increased.

The fourth mode is when the mobile device is never in proximity of the product microwave . In this situation when information such as accumulated use time periods failure mode information and the like of the microwave is to be recorded from the CPU of the microwave onto a memory in the NFC unit or a memory shared between the NFC unit and the microwave if the CPU is operating the microwave supplies power to at least the NFC unit and the shared memory for the recording. It is not necessary to supply power to the entire NFC unit. In order to prevent simultaneous writing from the NFC unit the clock supply to the shared memory is blocked during a period of the recording. The use time periods may be recorded so that the NFC unit can read a part of the information recorded in the shared memory in the microwave. Thereby even if for example the power plug of the microwave is not set to the power outlet in recycling the mobile device can read from the CPU of the microwave the use time periods failure mode information and the like. Of course the RF ID unit in the embodiments may be a ROM chip of NFC technology a NFC circuit or the like.

There is another application of mobility service in which a Digital Living Network Alliance DLNA technology is used to transfer video data from a TV on the first floor to a TV in a bed room on the second floor for example. In this case the fact that an operator of a terminal mobile device goes to the bed room on the second floor is managed by using position information in a server. The server can expect that the operator entering the bed room on the second floor will bring a terminal into proximity of the TV in the bed room. Therefore connection procedure using the DLNA technology or the like has previously been completed so that video data is switched to be displayed on the TV in the bed room as soon as the terminal is moved to proximity of the TV in order to improve a speed of the switching process. It is also possible that an eye direction sensor is equipped in the bed room on the second floor. In this aspect when the operator enters the bed room and looks at the TV video data is switched to be displayed on the TV using the DLNA connection or the like. Therefore as soon as the operator enters the bed room and looks at the TV the TV is powered ON and the video data displayed in the room on the first floor or the mobile device the terminal is switched to be displayed on the TV in the bed room on the second floor. Only eye direction can switch where to display the video data. As described above if registration of the position information of the TV is performed as described in the embodiments of the present invention applications of home appliances can be significantly enlarged.

The present invention allows a receiving device apparatus such as a TV to receive data such as images from a server by simple procedures. The present invention is useful in any systems for simplifying operations of a display device apparatus such as a TV or personal computer for obtaining data via the Internet. The communication device according to an aspect of the present invention may be implemented as various devices having a RF ID unit in which identification information and a virtual machine program are stored. For example the communication device may be electronic devices such as a camera home appliances such as a rice cooker and a refrigerator and daily commodities such as a toothbrush.
