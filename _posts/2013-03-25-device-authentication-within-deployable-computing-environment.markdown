title: Device authentication within deployable computing environment
abstract: A deployable computing environment may facilitate interaction and data sharing between users and devices. Users, devices, and relationships between the users and devices may be represented within the deployable computing environment. A relationship between a user and a device may specify that the device is owned by the user and that the device is authorized to perform operations within the deployable computing environment on behalf of the user. Secure authentication of devices and users for interaction within the deployable computing environment is achieved by authenticating tickets corresponding to the user, the device, and the relationship. A device identification ticket and a user identification ticket are used to authenticate the device and user for interaction within the deployable computing environment. A device claim ticket allows the device to perform delegated operations (e.g., data synchronization, peer connectivity, etc.) on behalf of the user without the user's credentials (e.g., user identification ticket).

This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 248 137 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 412 930 filed on Oct. 9 2008 and titled DEVICE AUTHENTICATION WITHIN DEPLOYABLE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT at least some of which may be incorporated herein.

Many users utilize information through multiple computing devices. It is advantageous to synchronize the data between the computing devices because some of the information may be relevant to one or more computing devices the user owns. Users may also synchronize data between computing devices owned by other users. One approach to facilitate synchronization between devices and users is to host a distributed computing environment that users and devices may use to access other devices and their data. Authentication becomes a significant consideration where multiple users with multiple devices are sharing information with other users and devices.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

As more users share and synchronize data between their devices and other user s devices a secure technique for authenticating users and their devices in desirable. A deployable computing environment may be used to facilitate interacting with shared data of multiple users and devices. Many devices e.g. cell phone PDA etc. may be configured to share and synchronize data through the deployable computing environment. It is inefficient for a user to authenticate a device every time the device connects to and performs operations within the deployable computing environment. It would be advantageous to have the owner specify within the deployable computing environment a relationship that the owner owns the device and has delegated operations that the device may perform on behalf of the owner.

An alternative technique for authorizing and representing users devices and relationships between users and devices within a deployable computing environment is provided herein. A user may be authenticated to perform user operations within the deployable computing environment by sending a user identification ticket corresponding to the representation of the user within the deployable computing environment. The device may be authenticated to perform device operations within the deployable computing environment by sending a device identification ticket corresponding to the representation of the device within the deployable computing environment. The device may also be authenticated to perform additional operations e.g. authorized user operations on behalf of the user by sending a device claim ticket corresponding to the representation of the relationship between the device and the user within the deployable computing environment.

This technique provides a way to securely represent register and authenticate users and devices. Secure relationships between authenticated users and devices may be established and or revoked. This enables peer connectivity data synchronization digital media licensing etc. Within the relationship a user may securely delegate operations that a device may perform on behalf of the user.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

A deployable computing environment may be used to facilitate data storage and synchronization between users and devices. A user or device may be able to store data as a resource within the deployable computing environment. The data may reside within the deployable computing environment as a user resource or an object e.g. a core object mapping to a device comprising the data. The user or device may subscribe to resources owned by the device the user and or other devices and other users. A secure environment through authenticating users and devices is beneficial because multiple users and devices may subscribe and perform operations upon the shared data.

To facilitate authenticating a user a representation of the user may be created when the user first joins the deployable computing environment. Upon a request to join from the user the credentials of the user e.g. a user identification token may be used to authenticate the user. Upon authenticating the user an identity resource may be created within the deployable computing environment to represent the user. A user identification ticket is sent to the user for future authorization to interact within the deployable computing environment.

The user may register a device within the deployable computing environment. The user may send a request to create a representation of the device within the deployable computing environment. The request may comprise the user identification ticket and other information regarding the device and or user. Upon authenticating the user identification ticket a device resource may be created within the deployable computing environment to represent the device. A device identification ticket is sent to the device for future authorization to interact within the deployable computing environment. The device may use the device identification ticket to perform operations that the device is authorized to perform e.g. authorized device operations which may be limited compared to authorized user operations .

The device may be able to perform operations within the deployable computing environment on behalf of the user. Because the device can perform limited operations within the deployable computing environment with its own credentials a relationship may be established between the device and the user to delegate additional operations that may be performed on behalf of the user. The user may claim the device by sending a request for a representation of the relationship between the user and the device to be created within the deployable computing environment. The request may comprise a user identification ticket and a device identification ticket that may be used to authenticate the user and the device. Upon authenticating the user identification ticket and the device identification ticket a device claim resource may be created to represent the relationship between the user and the device that is claimed. A device claim ticket is sent to the device for future authorization to perform operations on behalf of the user. Within the device resource claim the user may delegate operations that the device may perform on the user s behalf.

The user has the ability to revoke the device. Upon a request to revoke the device the corresponding device claim resource may be terminated within the deployable computing environment. The device will be unable to renew the device claim ticket after expiration. Device claim tickets user identification tickets and or device identification tickets may have a time to live value e.g. 8 hours . Once the time to live expires the user and or device may request a new ticket for authentication to access the deployable computing environment.

In one example of authenticating tickets a user identification ticket may be used to securely identify the bearer as an authenticated user of a resource within a deployable computing environment. A device identification ticket may be used to securely identify the bearer as a device that may interact with resources within the deployable computing environment. A device claim ticket may be used to securely assert the existence of a relationship between the user and the device. The user while physically present on the device may present the user identification ticket and the device identification ticket for establishing a relationship between the device and the user. Once the relationship has been established thereby the user may present the user identification ticket and the device claim ticket e.g. a device authorization token for proving a relationship between the device and the user. The device may similarly present the device identification ticket and the device claim ticket for proving a relationship between the device and the user.

It may be appreciated that when a device requests a device claim ticket a link to the device claim ticket may be comprised within a device claim resource e.g. a representation in the deployable computing environment of the relationship of the device and the user . The device may download the device claim ticket through a fetch operation from a specified URL.

In another example a first device may request authentication for peer to peer connectivity. A device to device authorization token may be used to securely determine a relationship exists between the first authenticated device and a second authenticated device. The first authenticated device and or the second authenticated device may send a device identification ticket and a device to device authorization token for proving that a relationship between the first authenticated device and the second authenticated device exists and peer to peer connectivity is permissible.

Four common authentication scenarios may arise. In the first scenario the user may send the user identification ticket for authorization to perform user operations within the deployable computing environment. A user operation may comprise creating a relationship between a device and the user modifying user properties modifying a user resource associated with the user within the deployable computing environment creating a user resource deleting a user resource and or other operations related to the user.

In the second scenario the device may send the device identification ticket for authorization to perform device operations within the deployable computing environment. A device operation may comprise synchronizing with a user resource subscribing to a resource notification for a user resource receiving update notifications allocated for the device and or other operations related to the device.

In the third scenario the device may send the device identification ticket for authentication and a device claim ticket for authorization to perform user operations on behalf of the user. The device identification ticket is used to authorize the device to interact within the deployable computing environment. The device claim ticket allows the device to perform operations on behalf of the user. For example once the device is authenticated authorized through the device identification ticket the device may discover other devices the user owns. If user has delegated permission for the device to perform operations related to the other devices then the device may performs operations on behalf of the user such as subscribing to resources owned by the other device. In another example the device may request a peer to peer connection with a device the user has delegated permission to interact with.

In a fourth scenario the user may send a user identification ticket and a device claim ticket for authorization for the user to perform tasks involving the device e.g. authorized device operations . For example the user may be authorized to establish a remote UI session to the device. In another example the user may remotely instruct the device to begin synchronization with a new set of content within the deployable computing environment e.g. a new user resource . This allows the user to present the device claim ticket for authorization e.g. to prove a relationship exists between the user and the device to perform operations related to or on behalf of the device.

It may be appreciated that many other scenarios may occur related to authentication of users and devices.

It may be appreciated that an authentication agent or authorization agent e.g. an authenticator may authenticate a device a user and or a relationship by comparing data within a ticket to data stored within a representation of the corresponding device user and or relationship in a deployable computing environment.

One embodiment of representing a relationship between a device and a user claiming the device in a deployable computing environment is illustrated by an exemplary method in . At the method begins. At a device identification ticket and a user identification ticket are received from a device. The device identification ticket is used to authenticate the device within the deployable computing environment. The user identification ticket is used to authenticate the user within the deployable computing environment.

At the device identification ticket and the user identification ticket are authenticated. If the device identification ticket has expired then the device may request a new device identification ticket corresponding to the device. If the user identification ticket has expired then the user may request a new user identification ticket by sending a token for authentication. If the user identification ticket and or the device identification ticket are not authenticated then a failure message may be returned to the device and or user at . At the device identification ticket and the user identification ticket are authenticated to access the deployable computing environment. At a device claim e.g. a device claim resource in regarding a relationship between the device and the user may be represented within the deployable computing environment. The device claim may be created in response to the user requesting that the device is to be claimed by the user.

The device claim represents the relationship between the device and the user claiming the device. The device claim may specify that the user owns the device and the user has delegated rights to the device to perform operations on behalf of the user that the device would otherwise not be permitted to perform without user credentials. For example the user may delegate permission for the device to synchronize data access other devices the client owns enumerate user resources etc.

At a device claim ticket associated with the device claim is issued to the device. The device claim ticket may be used by the device to perform operations within the deployable computing environment on behalf of the user. For example the device may perform authorized user operations. Authorized user operations may comprise enumerating user resources modifying user properties modifying a user resource e.g. data owned by the user associated with the user within the deployable computing environment mapping or updating a resource in the deployable computing environment subscribing to another resource residing on another device owned by the user and or other user operations that may be performed within a deployable computing environment.

For the device to connect to the deployable computing environment to perform operations on behalf of the user the device may send a device identification ticket along with the device claim ticket. The device is authenticated through the device identification ticket. Once the device is authenticated the device claim ticket provides the permission to perform operations on behalf of the user. The device claim ticket device identification ticket and or the user identification ticket may comprise a ticket validity period e.g. a time to live value . For example a ticket may expire within 8 hours corresponding to a typical business day . After the ticket expires the user and or device may request a new ticket used for authentication within the deployable computing environment. At the method ends.

One embodiment of authenticating at least one operation by a device in a deployable computing environment is illustrated by an exemplary method in . At the method begins. At a device claim ticket is requested from the device. At the device claim ticket is received. At the device claim ticket is authenticated. The device claim ticket may be authenticated by determining whether a representation of a relationship e.g. a device claim resource exists between the device and a user e.g. a use that owns the device and has delegated operations the device may perform on behalf of the device .

It may be appreciated that a device identification ticket may be requested for authentication for the device to interact within the deployable computing environment. Once the device identification ticket is authenticated e.g. the device is authorized to access the deployable computing environment the device claim ticket may be used to determine what operations the device may perform within the deployable computing environment on behalf of the user.

At permission of the device to perform at least one authorized user operation is verified. For example a device claim resource may specify the operations that the device may perform. At upon authenticating the device claim ticket and verifying permission at least one authorized user operation is performed. At the method ends.

The identity resource may comprise a private user data e.g. user configuration settings mappings to user resources owned by the user a set of devices owned by the user etc. . The identity resource may comprise a set of links to device claims e.g. a mapping to device claims representing the relationship between the user and device the user claimed and delegated rights to . The identity resource may comprise a user identification ticket which may be used to identify and authenticate a user identification ticket sent by the user. The user identification ticket may authorize the user to interact within the deployable computing environment.

A request may be received from a device to register within the deployable computing environment. If the device is authorized to register itself a device resource may be created to represent the device within the deployable computing environment.

The device resource may comprise a device data e.g. device configuration settings . The device resource may comprise a set of links to device related resources e.g. a set of resources the device is subscribed to receive notifications about a second device the device may synchronize with etc. . The device may comprise a device identification ticket . The device identification ticket may be used for authentication of a device identification ticket sent by the device for authorization to interact within the deployable computing environment.

A request may be received from a user to claim a device. A user identification ticket and a device identification ticket may be received to authenticate the user and or device to interact within the deployable computing environment. Upon authentication of the user identification ticket and the device identification ticket a device claim resource may be created within the deployable computing environment. The device claim resource represents the relationship between the user and the device within the deployable computing environment.

The device claim resource may comprise a device claim data e.g. authorized user operations the device may perform on behalf of the device . The device claim resource may comprise a link to claimed device and a link to identity that claimed device . The device claim resource may comprise tickets . The tickets may comprise a device claim ticket . The device claim ticket may be used to authenticate a device claim ticket sent by the device.

It may be appreciated that the device identification ticket the user identification ticket and or the device claim ticket may be a link or URL to the actual location of the ticket.

Once the identity resource is created a user identification ticket is sent to the user . The user identification ticket may be used by the user for authentication purposes. For example the user may subsequently send the user identification ticket to the authenticator for authentication. Once authenticated the user may perform user operations within the deployable computing environment .

If authentication of the user identification ticket fails a request may be sent to the user for user identification information e.g. user identification token . Authentication may fail for various reasons one reason may be that the user identification ticket has expired. Once the user is authenticated based upon the user identification information a new user identification ticket is issued to the user .

Once the device resource is created a device identification ticket is sent to the device . The device may subsequently use the device identification ticket for authentication purposes. For example the device may send the device identification ticket to the authenticator for authentication. Upon authenticating the device identification ticket the device may interact within the deployable computing environment e.g. perform authorized device operations . Authorized device operations may comprise synchronizing with a resource within the deployable computing environment subscribing to a resource owned by another device receiving notifications of updates to a subscribed resource etc.

The device claim resource e.g. device claim resource of may represent the relationship between the user and the device . For example the device claim resource indicates that the user owns the device and that the device may perform authorized user operations on behalf of the user without the need for authenticating the user . The device claim resource may specify which other devices and user resources e.g. user data within the deployable computing environment that the device may access and or perform operations upon.

Once the device claim resource is created tickets may be sent to the device . The tickets may comprise a device claim ticket and or a device identification ticket. The device identification ticket may be used by the device for authentication purposes. The device claim ticket may be used by the device to perform operations e.g. authorized user operations within the deployable computing environment on behalf of the user without the need for the user to authenticate the device with the user s credentials e.g. user identification ticket .

Once the device claim ticket and the device identification ticket are authenticated a verification may be made as to whether the device has permission delegated by the user to perform the operation . For example a device claim resource may comprise information regarding the rights e.g. authorized user operations that the device may perform on behalf of the user without the user s credentials delegated by the user to the device . If the device has permission to perform the operation then the operation is performed and an operation output may be sent to the device .

The device 1 is represented within a deployable computing environment as a device 1 resource . The relationship of device 1 with a user owning device 1 is represented as device 1 claim resource . The device 2 is represented within a deployable computing environment as a device 2 resource . The relationship of device 2 with the user e.g. the owner of device 1 owning device 2 is represented as device 2 claim resource . The identity resource is the representation of the user within the deployable computing environment . The user resource e.g. a core object is a representation of user data associated with the deployable computing environment .

The authenticator authenticates the device identification ticket allowing the device 1 to interact within the deployable computing environment . The authenticator authenticates the device claim ticket allowing the device 1 to perform operations e.g. perform an invitation for a peer to peer connection with the device 2 owned by the user on behalf of the user. A verification may be performed to determine whether the device 1 has been delegated permission to perform the invitation on behalf of the user. Upon verifying permission the invitation is performed and a peer to peer data e.g. a device connection ticket is issued to device 1 . Device 1 may create a peer to peer connection with device 2 based upon the peer to peer data .

In another example a device to device authorization token may be received by the authenticator from either device 1 and or device 2 . The device to device authorization token may be used to authenticate a relationship between device 1 and device 2 . Once the device to device authorization token is authenticated e.g. a relationship is determined a peer to peer connection may be established between device 1 and device 2 .

If a relationship exists between the user and the device then the authenticator may perform a delete device claim resource operation to cancel the relationship between the device and the user . For example the authenticator terminates the device claim resource . Once the relationship is canceled a success message may be sent to the user . Because the device claim resource is terminated the device is unable to request a new device claim ticket to be issued to the device . If the device attempts to renew the device claim ticket the authenticator may send a ticket renewal denied message to the device .

If the device resource exists within the deployable computing environment then the device may still be authenticated based upon a device identification ticket. The device may still access and interact within the deployable computing environment through authorization of the device identification ticket. But without the device claim ticket the device may not perform operations on behalf of the user .

The representation component is configured to create a representation of a device a user and or a relationship between the device and the user . For example a request may be received from the user to register within a deployable computing environment . The representation component performs an operation to create a resource e.g. an identity resource representing the user within the deployable computing environment . In another example the representation component may create a device resource within the deployable computing environment to represent the device . In a further example the representation component may create a device claim resource within the deployable computing environment to represent the relationship between the user and the device . The relationship may describe that the user owns the device and that the user delegated rights to the device to perform operation within the deployable computing environment on behalf of the user .

The ticket generating component is configured to generate and issue a ticket to the user and or the device . Once the user and or the device are authenticated e.g. authorized to access the deployable computing environment the ticket generating component may determine if a corresponding ticket is allocated for the user and or device . The corresponding ticket and or a location to retrieve the corresponding ticket may be located within the deployable computing environment e.g. within a resource . If corresponding ticket is allocated a message is sent to the user and or device with the ticket and or location of the ticket. For example a user identification ticket may be generated and issued to the user a device identification ticket may be generated and issued to the device and or a device claim ticket may be generated and issued to the device to use on behalf of the user .

The ticket authentication component is configured to receive and authenticate a ticket. For example the user may send a user identification ticket to the ticket authentication component . The ticket authentication component may authenticate the user identification ticket by determining if the user identification ticket correlates to ticket information stored within the identity resource representing the user . If the user identification ticket is authenticated then the user is able to access and interact within the deployable computing environment . In another example the ticket authentication component may receive and identify a device identification ticket from a device . If the device identification ticket is authenticated then the device may access and interact within the deployable computing environment .

In a further example the ticket authentication component may receive the device identification ticket and a device claim ticket. The ticket authentication component may authenticate the device identification ticket so the device may access the deployable computing environment . The ticket authentication component may authenticate the device claim ticket so the device may perform delegated operations e.g. authorized user operations within the deployable computing environment on behalf of the user without the user s credentials e.g. user identification ticket .

Providing a representation of a device a user and a relationship between the device and the user within a deployable computing environment allows for secure authentication of the user and or device. A device identification ticket a user identification ticket and a device claim ticket are used to authenticate and establish what rights the user and or device may have when interacting within the deployable computing environment. With the device claim ticket the device may perform operations e.g. operations delegated by the user on behalf of the user. This enables peer connectivity data synchronization digital media licensing etc.
