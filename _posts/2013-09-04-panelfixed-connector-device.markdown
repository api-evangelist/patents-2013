The present invention relates to a panel fixing type connector device in which a first connector housing and a second connector housing are fitted to each other with a panel interposed therebetween.

In the connector housings and terminal metal fittings not illustrated which are electrically connected to each other when the two connector housings and are fitted to each other are respectively accommodated. A first connector is constituted by the first connector housing and the terminal metal fittings accommodated in the first connector housing . In addition a second connector is constituted by the second connector housing and the terminal metal fittings accommodated in the second connector housing .

The first connector housing is provided with temporary locking arms . The temporary locking arms include locking protrusions . When the first connector housing is inserted into the mounting hole Pa of the panel P from the one side the temporary locking arm is bent inward from the initial positions by coming into sliding contact with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa. In addition when the first connector housing is further inserted to a predetermined position the temporary locking locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position such that the locking protrusion is locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa. Accordingly the temporary locking arm temporarily locks the first connector housing to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P in a state of impeding the movement of the first connector housing toward the one side.

The second connector housing is provided with complete fixing portions which are locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P to allow the second connector housing to be completely fixed to the panel P. In addition the second connector housing is provided with temporary locking releasing portions which when the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing in the state where the locking protrusions of the temporary locking arms are locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P allow the temporary locking arm to be bent inward during the fitting operation and thus release the locking of the temporary locking arms to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P.

In addition main locking portions which allow the first connector housing and the second connector housing to be locked to each other when the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other are provided between the first connector housing and the second connector housing .

The main locking portions include locking arms provided in the first connector housing and stepped portions provided in the second connector housing . The stepped portion is provided by concavely forming an inclined surface which is increased in height moving toward the rear side and the rear end portion thereof serves as a locking portion. The tip end of the locking arm is provided with a lower surface engagement protrusion and an upper surface engagement protrusion

When the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing part way during the fitting the lower surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm and the stepped portion interfere with each other. Due to the interference the locking arm is bent outward from the initial position. In addition when the fitting further proceeds and then a completely fitted state is achieved the locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position. Accordingly the lower surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm is engaged with the rear end portion of the stepped portion such that the first connector housing and the second connector housing are locked to each other.

When the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing in a state where the tip end of the locking arm is inserted into the mounting hole Pa of the panel P and the lower surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm and the stepped portion interfere with each other part way during the fitting so as to cause the locking arm to be bent outward the upper surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm interferes with panel P such that the locking arm and the stepped portion restrict the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel P until the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other. In addition in a state where the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other the upper surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm which returns to the initial position from the bent position comes away from the position that interferes with the panel P such that the locking arm and the stepped portion also function as movement restricting and allowing portions which allow the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel P.

In a case of using the connector device first the first connector housing is mounted in the mounting hole Pa of the panel P from the one side in the direction perpendicular to the panel P. At this time as the tip end of the temporary locking arm is inserted into the mounting hole Pa the locking protrusion of the temporary locking arm comes into sliding contact with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa such that the temporary locking arm is bent inward. When the tip end of the temporary locking arm is further inserted to a predetermined position the temporary locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position such that the locking protrusion of the temporary locking arm is locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. Accordingly the first connector housing is temporarily locked to the panel P.

Subsequently the second connector housing is fitted from the opposite side of the panel P to the first connector housing in the state where the locking protrusion of the temporary locking arm is locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. Then the temporary locking releasing portion allows the temporary locking arm to be bent inward as the fitting operation proceeds such that the locking of the locking protrusion of the temporary locking arm to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P is released.

In addition during the operation of fitting the second connector housing to the first connector housing the lower surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm on the first connector housing which is included in the main locking portion rides on the stepped portion on the second connector housing side which is the opposite side to the panel P that is the second connector housing side . Accordingly the locking arm is bent outward such that the upper surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm is engaged with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. As a result the first connector housing is restricted so as not to move relative to the panel P. Therefore the second connector housing can be fitted to the first connector housing in the state of being fixed to the panel P.

When the second connector housing is completely fitted to the first connector housing the lower surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm of the main locking portion is placed over the stepped portion the locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position and the lower surface engagement protrusion is engaged with the rear end portion of the stepped portion . Accordingly the first connector housing and the second connector housing are locked to each other.

In this state as the locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position the upper surface engagement protrusion of the locking arm comes away from the position that is engaged with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P and thus the first connector housing can move relative to the panel P. Therefore by pushing the second connector housing fitted to the first connector housing against the panel P the complete fixing portion provided in the second connector housing can be locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. Accordingly the second connector housing and the first connector housing can be completely fixed to the panel P.

Here in the above described connector device of the related art it was found that the following points have to be technically examined.

That is in the connector device of the related art when the second connector housing is fitted from the opposite side of the panel P to the first connector housing in the state where the locking protrusion of the temporary locking arm is locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P the locking of the temporary locking arm to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P is released by the action of the temporary locking releasing portion part way during the fitting. In a case where the fitting is stopped part way during the fitting to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing there is a possibility that the second connector housing may be separated from the first connector housing before the locking protrusion of the temporary locking arm is re locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa. When the second connector housing is separated the first connector housing may also be separated from the panel P.

The present invention has been made taking the foregoing circumstances into consideration and an object thereof is to provide a panel fixing type connector device which guarantees that a first connector housing is not separated from a panel even in a case where part way during fitting of a second connector housing to the first connector housing which is in a state of being temporarily locked to a mounting hole of the panel in advance the fitting is stopped for some reason to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing.

a first connector housing which is mounted in a mounting hole of a panel from one side in a direction perpendicular to the panel and

a second connector housing which is fitted to the first connector housing with the panel interposed therebetween through the mounting hole from the other side in the direction perpendicular to the panel in which 

the first connector housing is provided with temporary locking arms which are bent inward from initial positions as an outer inclined surface of the arm comes into sliding contact with a peripheral edge of the mounting hole when the first connector housing is inserted into the mounting hole of the panel from the one side return to the initial positions from the bent positions when the first connector housing is further inserted to a predetermined position so as to allow the locking portion to be locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole and temporarily lock the first connector housing to the mounting hole of the panel in a state of impeding movement of the first connector housing toward the one side 

the main locking portions include a locking arm provided in the first connector housing and a locking protrusion provided in the second connector housing 

when the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing part way during the fitting operation the locking arm and the locking protrusion interfere with each other such that the locking arm is bent outward from an initial position 

when the fitting operation further proceeds and then a completely fitted state is achieved the locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position such that an engagement portion provided in the locking arm is engaged with the locking protrusion and accordingly the first connector housing and the second connector housing are locked to each other 

when the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing in a state where the engagement portion of the locking arm is inserted into the mounting hole of the panel and the locking arm and the locking protrusion interfere with each other part way during the fitting operation so as to cause the locking arm to be bent outward the engagement portion of the locking arm interferes with the panel such that the locking arm and the locking protrusion restrict the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel until the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other 

in a state where the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other the engagement portion of the locking arm which returns to the initial position from the bent position comes away from a position that interferes with the panel such that the locking arm and the locking protrusion also function as the movement restricting and allowing portions which allow the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel and

the locking protrusion is further provided with as a separation prevention portion a separation prevention rib protruding therefrom which when the locking of the temporary locking arm to the mounting hole of the panel is released by the temporary locking releasing portion as the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing until an intermediate stage in the state where the locking protrusion is locked to the mounting hole of the panel and in this state the fitting of the second connector housing to the first connector housing is stopped to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing is engaged with the engagement portion of the locking arm which is bent outward and thus pulls the first connector housing to a position at which the temporary locking arm in a state where the locking to the mounting hole of the panel is released is re locked to the mounting hole of the panel due to the separation operation of the second connector housing.

According to the connector device having the configuration of 1 when the locking of the temporary locking arm to the mounting hole of the panel is released by the temporary locking releasing portion as the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing until an intermediate stage in the state where the temporary locking arm is locked to the mounting hole of the panel and in this state the fitting of the first connector housing to the second connector housing is stopped to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing the first connector housing can by pulled by the action of the separation prevention portion to the position at which the temporary locking arm in the state where the locking to the mounting hole of the panel is released is re locked to the mounting hole of the panel due to the separation operation of the second connector housing. Therefore the temporary locking arm can be re locked to the mounting hole of the panel by the pulling operation and thus the separation of the first connector housing from the panel can be impeded.

According to the connector device having the configuration of 2 since the separation prevention rib as the separation prevention portion is provided in the locking protrusion which is engaged with the locking arm when the fitting operation is stopped part way during the operation of fitting the second connector housing to the first connector housing to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing the engagement portion of the locking arm which is bent outward and the separation prevention rib are engaged with each other such that the first connector housing can be pulled by the separation operation of the second connector housing. Accordingly the temporary locking arm in the locking released state can be re locked to the mounting hole of the panel and thus the separation of the first connector housing from the panel can be prevented.

According to the present invention it can be guaranteed that the first connector housing is not separated from the panel even in a case where part way during the operation of fitting the second connector housing to the first connector housing which is in a state of being temporarily locked to the mounting hole of the panel in advance the fitting operation is stopped for some reason to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing.

Hereinabove the present invention is briefly described. Furthermore the details of the present invention will be further clarified by reading through the modes for embodying the present invention hereinafter referred to as embodiments described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

As illustrated in a panel fixing type connector device of the embodiment includes a first connector housing which is mounted in a mounting hole Pa of a panel P from one side in a direction perpendicular to the panel P and a second connector housing which is fitted to the first connector housing with the panel P interposed between the first connector housing and the second connector housing through the mounting hole Pa from the other side in the direction perpendicular to the panel P.

In the connector housings and terminal metal fittings not illustrated which are electrically connected to each other when the two connector housings and are fitted to each other are respectively accommodated. A first connector is constituted by the first connector housing and the terminal metal fittings accommodated in the first connector housing . In addition second connector is constituted by the second connector housing and the terminal metal fittings accommodated in the second connector housing . In the descriptions of the connector housings and a front side indicates a forward side which is fitted to the opposite connector housing and a rear side indicates the opposite side thereto. In addition an upper side and a lower side respectively indicate the upper side and the lower side illustrated in .

As illustrated in the first connector housing includes a connector body portion in which a cylindrical fitting portion is formed in the front half and a terminal accommodation chamber is formed in the rear half. In addition the first connector housing includes an upper cover portion which is provided to cover the upper side of the axially intermediate portion of the connector body portion . In the first connector housing male terminal metal fittings not illustrated are accommodated in the terminal accommodation chamber of the connector body portion and the tip end of each of the male terminal metal fittings protrudes from the inner portion of the cylindrical fitting portion

As illustrated in temporary locking arms are respectively provided on the right and left sides of the first connector housing . When the first connector housing is inserted into the mounting hole Pa of the panel P from the one side an outer inclined surface of the temporary locking arm comes into sliding contact with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P such that the temporary locking arm is bent inward from the initial position. The temporary locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position when the first connector housing is further inserted to a predetermined position such that a locking stepped portion is locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa. Accordingly the temporary locking arm temporarily locks the first connector housing to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P in a state of impeding the movement of the first connector housing toward the one side.

The temporary locking arm is formed in a cantilevered shape such that the front end portion is fixed to the side portion of the connector body portion and the free end extends rearward. In the temporary locking arm the outer inclined surface which is inclined to protrude outward moving from the front side to the rear side is formed on the arm outer surface positioned on the front side of the locking stepped portion .

As illustrated in the second connector housing includes a prismatic connector body portion which fits in the inner portion of the cylindrical fitting portion of the connector body portion of the first connector housing . In addition the second connector housing includes an upper cover wall which is provided on the upper side of the connector body portion with an interval therebetween and a flange which is provided at the rear ends of the connector body portion and the upper cover wall . Female terminal metal fittings not illustrated are accommodated in a terminal accommodation chamber of the connector body portion . When the connector body portion of the second connector housing is fitted into the cylindrical fitting portion of the connector body portion of the first connector housing the male terminal metal fittings accommodated in the first connector housing and the female terminal metal fittings accommodated in the second connector housing are electrically connected to each other.

As illustrated in sliding grooves in which ribs formed on the upper surface of the connector body portion of the first connector housing are respectively fitted are provided on the lower surface of the upper cover wall of the second connector housing . As the ribs are fitted in the sliding grooves the fitting operation of the first connector housing and the second connector housing is guided.

In addition in the right and left side portions of the upper cover wall of the second connector housing complete fixing arms that is body fixing portions which are locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa when inserted into the mounting hole Pa of the panel P to completely fix the second connector housing to the panel P are provided. The complete fixing arms are provided with locking protrusions which allow the panel P to be interposed between the locking protrusions and the flange without backlash.

At positions of the right and left side portions of the upper cover wall of the second connector housing which correspond to the temporary locking arms on the first connector housing side temporary locking releasing portions are provided which when the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing in the state where the locking stepped portions of the temporary locking arms are locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P allowing the temporary locking arms to be bent inward during the fitting operation and thus release the locking of the locking stepped portions of the temporary locking arms to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. The temporary locking releasing portion allows the temporary locking arm to be bent inward by sliding on the outer inclined surface of the temporary locking arm when the second connector housing is initially fitted to the first connector housing .

Main locking portions which allow the first connector housing and the second connector housing to be locked to each other when the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other are provided between the first connector housing and the second connector housing .

The main locking portions include locking arm provided in the first connector housing and locking protrusions provided in the second connector housing .

The locking arm is provided between the upper surface of the connector body portion of the first connector housing and the upper cover portion and is formed in a cantilevered shape such that the rear end is fixed to the connector body portion and the free end which extends forward. The front end that is the free end of the locking arm is provided with an engagement portion which laterally protrudes from the width of the base end side of the locking arm and the rear end surface of the engagement portion serves as an engagement wall .

The locking protrusion is provided on the upper surface of the upper cover wall of the second connector housing to correspond to the position of the engagement portion which laterally protrudes from the front end of the locking arm . The rear end surface of the locking protrusion serves as an engagement wall which is engaged with the engagement wall of the rear end surface of the engagement portion of the locking arm .

When the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing the engagement portion of the locking arm and the locking protrusion interfere with each other part way during the fitting operation. The locking arm is bent outward upward in from the initial position due to the interference. In addition when the fitting operation further proceeds and then a completely fitted state is achieved the locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position. Accordingly the engagement wall of the engagement portion of the locking arm is engaged with the engagement wall of the locking protrusion such that the first connector housing and the second connector housing are locked to each other.

When the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing in a state where the temporary locking arm is locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P the locking arm and the locking protrusion restrict the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel P until the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other. In a state where the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other the locking arm and the locking protrusion also function as movement restricting and allowing portions which allow the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel P.

That is when the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing in a state where the tip end of the locking arm is inserted into the mounting hole Pa of the panel P and the engagement portion of the locking arm and the locking protrusion interfere with each other part way during the fitting operation so as to cause the locking arm to be bent outward the engagement portion of the locking arm interferes with panel P see such that the locking arm and the locking protrusion restrict the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel P until the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other. In addition in a state where the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other the engagement portion of the locking arm which returns to the initial position from the bent position comes away from the position that interferes with the panel P such that the locking arm and the locking protrusion also function as the movement restricting and allowing portions which allow the movement of the first connector housing relative to the panel P.

A separation prevention rib protrudes from the upper surface of the locking protrusion of the second connector housing . When the locking of the temporary locking arm to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P is released by the temporary locking releasing portion as the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing until an intermediate stage in the state where the locking arm is locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P and in this state the fitting of the second connector housing to the first connector housing is stopped to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing the separation prevention rib is engaged with the engagement portion of the locking arm which is bent outward. The separation prevention rib pulls the first connector housing to the position at which the temporary locking arm in a state where the locking to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P is released is re locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P due the separation operation of the second connector housing . That is the separation prevention rib functions as a separation prevention portion.

In a case of using the connector device first the first connector housing is mounted in the mounting hole Pa of the panel P from the one side in the direction perpendicular to the panel P. At this time as the tip end of the temporary locking arm is inserted into the mounting hole Pa the outer inclined surface of the temporary locking arm comes into sliding contact with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole such that the temporary locking arm is bent inward. When the temporary locking arm is further inserted to a predetermined position as illustrated in the temporary locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position such that the locking stepped portions of the temporary locking arms is locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. Accordingly the first connector housing is temporarily locked to the panel P.

Subsequently as illustrated in the second connector housing is fitted from the other side of the panel P to the first connector housing in the state where the locking stepped portion of the temporary locking arm is locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P movement indicated by arrow A in . Then the temporary locking releasing portions allows the temporary locking arms to be bent inward in the direction indicated by arrow X in part way during the fitting operation as the fitting operation proceeds as illustrated in such that the locking of the locking stepped portion of the temporary locking arms to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P is released. In this stage the locking stepped portions of the temporary locking arms is pushed back from the position that opposes the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P toward the one side such that the outer inclined surface of the temporary locking arm opposes the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P.

In addition as illustrated in during the operation of fitting the second connector housing to the first connector housing the engagement portion of the locking arm on the first connector housing side which is included in the main locking portion rides on the locking protrusion on the second connector housing side which is the opposite side to the panel P that is the second connector housing side . Accordingly the locking arm is bent outward that is the upper side in such that the engagement portion of the locking arm is engaged with the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. As a result the first connector housing is restricted so as not to move relative to the panel P. Therefore the second connector housing can be fitted to the first connector housing in the state of being fixed to the panel P.

In addition when the second connector housing is completely fitted to the first connector housing the engagement portion of the locking arm of the main locking portion is placed over the locking protrusion and the locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position such that the engagement wall of the engagement portion is engaged with the engagement wall of the locking protrusion . Accordingly the first connector housing and the second connector housing are locked to each other so as not to be separated from each other.

In this state as the locking arm returns to the initial position from the bent position the engagement portion of the locking arm comes away from the position that is engaged with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P and thus the first connector housing can move relative to the panel P. Therefore by pushing the second connector housing fitted to the first connector housing against the panel P the locking protrusions of the complete fixing arms provided in the second connector housing can be locked to the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P. Accordingly the second connector housing and the first connector housing can be completely fixed to the panel P.

However as illustrated in in a state where the locking of the temporary locking arm to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P is released by the temporary locking releasing portions as illustrated in as the second connector housing is fitted to the first connector housing until an intermediate stage in the state where the temporary locking arm is locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P there may be a case where the fitting of the second connector housing to the first connector housing is stopped for some reason and the second connector housing is separated from the first connector housing as indicated by arrow B.

In this case a slight pulling force is slightly applied to the first connector housing due to friction caused by the separating force of the second connector housing . However as the outer inclined surface of the temporary locking arm of the first connector housing comes into sliding contact with the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P a pushing back force in the opposite direction the direction indicated by dotted line arrow H in to the pulling direction that is the separation direction of the second connector housing indicated by arrow B is applied to the first connector housing by the elastic restoring force that is the restoring force in the direction indicated by arrow X in of the temporary locking arm .

As illustrated in a pulling force F due to the friction caused by the separating force of the second connector housing is applied to the first connector housing in the arrow B direction that is the separation direction of the second connector housing . At this time as the outer inclined surface of the temporary locking arm see slides on the peripheral edge of the mounting hole Pa of the panel P a pushing back force F is applied to the first connector housing in the arrow H direction that is the opposite direction to the separation direction of the second connector housing by the elastic restoring force of the temporary locking arm .

In this respect in the connector device of this embodiment as illustrated in the separation prevention rib as the separation prevention portion is provided on the upper surface of the locking protrusion engaged with the locking arm . Therefore as illustrated in when the fitting operation is stopped part way during the operation of fitting the second connector housing to the first connector housing to separate the second connector housing from the first connector housing as illustrated in the engagement portion of the locking arm which is bent outward and the separation prevention rib are engaged with each other such that the first connector housing can be pulled as indicated by arrow C in by the separation operation of the second connector housing .

That is as the separation prevention rib is caught on the engagement portion of the locking arm a holding force F is added in the arrow B direction by the separation prevention rib . Therefore the sum of forces applied to the first connector housing in the arrow B direction becomes larger than the force in the arrow H direction that is F F F . Accordingly the first connector housing can be pulled as indicated by arrow C in the same direction as the arrow B direction.

Therefore as illustrated in the temporary locking arm in the locking released state can be moved to the position that is re locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P and thus the re locking can be achieved. As a result as illustrated in even when the first connector housing and the second connector housing are separated from each other the separation of the first connector housing from the panel P can be prevented.

In the above description the case where the fitting operation is stopped part way during the fitting operation and the second connector housing is separated from the first connector housing is described. However even in a case where the second connector housing is separated in a state where the first connector housing and the second connector housing are completely fitted to each other the separation of the first connector housing from the panel P can be reliably prevented.

In addition the height of the separation prevention rib is set to a height which allows the separation prevention rib and the engagement portion of the locking arm not to be disengaged from each other until the temporary locking arm is re locked to the mounting hole Pa of the panel P.

In addition the present invention is not limited to the above described embodiment and modifications improvements and the like thereof can be appropriately made. Moreover the materials shapes dimensions numbers arrangements and the like of the elements in the above described embodiment are arbitrary as long as the present invention is achieved and are not limited.
