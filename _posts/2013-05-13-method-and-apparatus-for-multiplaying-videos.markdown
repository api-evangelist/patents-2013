The apparatus may be modified in various implementations known in the art along with the convergence trend of digital devices and thus not all such modifications may be listed here but the apparatus according to the present invention may further include known components that are not mentioned above such as a GPS module a vibration motor and a wired communication module for wired connection with an external device e.g. a personal computer etc. . Further some components of the apparatus of the present invention may be excluded or may be substituted by other components depending on the various applications and functions supported by the apparatus such as default applications and functions implemented during manufacture of the apparatus or depending on user selections to configure the apparatus .

Referring to the controller may receive a video from a source external to the apparatus through the wireless communication unit in step . In addition the controller may receive a video from an external device e.g. a PC connected by a wired line. The controller may store in the storage unit a video received from the external source. Further the controller may receive a video from the camera at step . If the camera outputs raw video data e.g. a non coded video the controller transmits the raw video data such as originally captured video received from the camera to the coder to be coded and stores the coded video in the storage unit . Here the controller itself may code the raw video data and store the coded data in the storage unit .

The controller determines whether the first decoder implemented as hardware H W i.e. the decoder is in use in step . In other words the controller determines whether the decoder is currently working e.g. decoding resizing etc. .

If the first decoder is in use the controller using software S W decodes the original video i.e. the received video to operate as a second decoder reduces the decoded original video and generates a video clip in step and proceeds to step . At this time as described with reference to the whole or a part of the original video may be converted into a video clip. Further the video clip may have been only decoded from the original video without reduction. In the controller in one exemplary embodiment only one core may generate a video clip. Alternatively a plurality of cores may participate in generation of a video clip. That is the cores respectively perform the role of the decoder. For example referring to if the controller receives the first video video and the second video video the first core core of the CPU may generate a video clip on chapters C and C of the first video video and the second core core of the CPU may generate a video clip on chapters C to C of the first video video . Further the first core core of the GPU may generate a video clip for chapters C and C of the second video video and the second core core of the GPU may generate a video clip for chapters C to C of the second video video . Hence several video clips may be simultaneously and quickly generated.

Referring back to if the first decoder is not in use as determined in step e.g. if the playing of a video is temporarily stopped if the screen is turned off if the first decoder is at an idle state etc. the controller controls the first decoder as a hardware based decoder to decode the original video i.e. the received video and reduce the decoded original video or alternatively as described above reduction may not be performed so as to generate a video clip in step . At this time at step the controller e.g. at least one of the cores of the CPU may also participate in generation of the video clip.

After steps and the controller stores the video clip generated in step or step in the storage unit in step .

The controller determines whether there has been a preview request in step . For example the display unit may display an application execution screen e.g. an execution screen of a video player including a button for a video preview under the control of the controller . The controller may detect a user s gesture e.g. a tap on a video preview button i.e. a preview request event on the display unit .

If no preview request is received in step the method loops back and repeatedly checks for receipt of a preview request in step . After the preview request is eventually received in step the controller simultaneously plays pre stored video clips in response to the preview request event in step . For example one or more cores may output video clips to the display unit such as one or more cores of only the GPU . Further one or more cores in the CPU and the GPU may output the video clips to the display unit . Further the controller may control the decoder to output the video clips to the display unit .

Further at step if only a part of the video clips stored in the storage unit has been decoded in the video the simultaneous playing of the part of the video clips is performed a new video clip is generated for the other non decoded part and the newly generated video clip may be stored in the storage unit . That is the controller generates a new video clip to allow a continuous preview. At this time the simultaneous playing is performed by one of the cores of the CPU and or the GPU and the generation and storing of the video clip may be performed by at least one other core. Further the simultaneous playing may be performed by the CPU and the generation and storing of the video clip may be performed by the GPU or alternatively the simultaneous playing may be performed by the GPU and the generation and storing of the video clip may be performed by the CPU .

According to the exemplary embodiment described with reference to when a video is newly generated or is newly downloaded from a source external to the apparatus a video clip for the video is automatically generated and is stored in the storage unit . That is video clips corresponding to respective videos are stored in advance. When the hardware based decoder H W is in use the controller may directly generate a video clip by the controller functioning as a software based decoder S W . If there is a preview request in a state where the video clips are stored in advance the controller simultaneously generates video clips stored in the storage unit . That is the controller may intuitively show to the user the high performance of the apparatus implementing for example a portable terminal by simultaneously playing video clips without a buffering time i.e. without a process of decoding and reducing a video .

Referring to the display unit may display a home screen under the control of the controller . The controller may detect selection of an icon e.g. tapping the icon corresponding to the video player application in the home screen. The controller executes a video player in response to the selection of the video player icon in step . The display unit may display an execution screen of the video player as shown in under the control of the controller . The execution screen of the video player may include a video play screen and a menu screen .

The controller may detect a play request event e.g. tapping a tab representing a play button . If a play request event is detected the controller may control the first decoder H W i.e. the decoder to play a video in step . That is the decoder decodes a video and outputs the decoded video on the display unit and the display unit converts the video by D A conversion and displays the converted video on the video play screen under the control of the controller . Here the replayed video may be a previously replayed video or a video selected by the user from a video list displayed on the execution screen or on other displayed screens. Further the control of the video playing may be performed by at least one core e.g. core of the CPU in the controller .

The controller performs a role of the second decoder in step . That is in the controller at least one core e.g. core to core of the CPU may generate video clips for respective chapters of the video being played and may temporarily store the generated video clips in the storage unit . That is if a chapter preview is requested the controller may generate video clips in advance and store the video clips so that the video clips may be simultaneously played without buffering time i.e. without a process of decoding and reducing a video .

The controller determines whether a preview has been requested in step . For example the controller may detect the selection e.g. tapping a tab of the chapter preview button from the menu screen .

If no preview request is received in step the method loops back and repeatedly checks for receipt of a preview request in step . After the preview request is eventually received in step the method proceeds to step in which as illustrated in the controller may simultaneously play pre stored video clips stored in the storage unit in response to the chapter preview request. For example one or more cores in the CPU or one or more cores from the GPU may output the video clips to the display unit . Further one or more cores respectively from the CPU and the GPU may output the video clips to the display unit . Further the controller may control the decoder to output the video clips to the display unit .

Further the controller may multi play video clips stored in advance in the storage unit and may generate new video clips and store the generated video clips in step . That is the controller generates new video clips to allow a continuous preview. At this time the simultaneous playing of video clips multi play is processed by one of cores of the CPU or the GPU and at least one other core in the CPU and or the GPU may process the generation and storing of the video clips. Further the simultaneous playing may be processed by the CPU and the generation and storing of the video clips may be processed by the GPU .

According to the exemplary embodiment described with reference to if a video is being played by the hardware based decoder in the apparatus so that the hardware based decoder is in use the controller generates video clips for each chapter of the video being played using the controller as a software based decoder. Likewise if a chapter preview is requested in a state in which video clips are stored in advance the controller simultaneously plays video clips for each chapter stored in the storage unit . That is the controller may intuitively show to the user the high performance of the apparatus to implement for example a portable terminal by multi playing video clips without buffering time.
